Second, add a leading lady who -- while not entirely unattractive -- represents many '80s clichÃ©s: big hair, too much makeup, two different plaids, shoulder pads, acid-washed mom-jeans, etc.
We know there will come a point where Day finally can't take anymore, and watching her soak up each new trespass while being forced to bottle her emotions allows us to truly be engulfed by the inner turmoil of this woman whose dreams are coming true, even as her life away from the stage is a nightmare.
Suffice it to say that though Cagney walks away with the picture as you would expect Day is only three or four steps behind while Robert Keith (who had played her father in YAH) scores well in the thankless nice-guy role as an agent.
One of the things that struck me was that while Joaquin Phoenix had a much tougher job because Johnny Cash was performing almost up to the end and had a distinctive sound that I didn't think anyone could match, Phoenix did a very good job in capturing him.
It helps, by classical Hollywood standards that in real life Ruth Etting achieved something of reconciliation with her murderous ex while dashing off into the sunset with Johnny.
The bio-based storyline plays out like somewhat like a crime drama, while the musical portion rings forth with twelve complete full-bodied numbers.
The casting is truly inspired: what a coup getting Doris Day, at the peak of her physical, acting and vocal powers to be cast in a real-life role, while snaring the brilliant, often breathtaking James Cagney--forever at the peak of his powers--as the indestructible "Gimp."
They bicker some more, with Cagney losing the argument while Day nurses the drink that has become her ally.
Years later she becomes a bloated whale - a shell of her former self - living in total abandon, watching Madeline's movies obsessively, seething in hatred, until she is evicted from her apartment and has a brilliant idea while in a mental facility: she must eliminate Madeline.
; however, Hawn and Willis, while established as personalities more than actors of considerable range, fare better than Streep in that she is "expected" to play hers to perfection.
These woman wants to pursue immortality while another man wants to choose mortality and live a full life.
However, the visual aspect of the film, while too tributary of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, made me think Fesser would ever make something of interest.
But, as in many of these film's story arcs, Karloff's scientists would proclaim that in order to achieve breakthroughs in science, sacrifice had to be made, most of the time those volunteers perhaps would've survived while under his care if those who oppose this new, "dangerous" science hadn't of interfered.
Instead, this solution, as written down while preparing it, stabilized those who ingested it, and so, for ten years, those in the ice chamber rooms remained in a cryogenic state, but kept alive.
Also, while made in the midst of the Universal horror period, it demonstrates some of the best elements of that genre, however it also pre-figures the oncoming decade of sci-fi flicks of the 50s, but with a more intelligent, and mysterious, plot than most of the B sci-fi films that followed.
However in RTW internal relations, while being represented in the game, are beyond the influence of the player.
Strangely, while in politics there is not enough control, there is to much control on the economic level.
You can develop every town in any way you see fit, while in reality and of necessity the ancient period lacked a tight centralized control.
I also like the Go Bot Characters, Leader 1, Sparky, Small Foot, Pathfinder, Scooter, Fitor and Cop-Tur, though it's been a while since I saw the movie and I can't remember if some of those characters were in it, alas.
You would expect a film with this sort of plot to be a completely brutal and sleazy affair, but Seven Murders for Scotland Yard is surprising in that aspect as while there are murders aplenty, there's no real nudity, and the murders themselves have been heavily edited, so we don't get to see much more than a bit of blood.
I saw the Criminal on Palm Pictures VOD and i must say, while at first I was skeptical, I thought it was a fantastic movie that unwounded perfectly with many twists and turns along the way.
And while that's not exactly a compliment, at least this low budget attempt at North by Northwest proves first-time writer/director Julian Simpson is not given to compromise.
Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it's obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them.
Jim's attentions build up Rachel's status in Davey's eyes while causing David to see her obvious attractions for the first time.
The story will stay with you for a while.
Faced with his sexual desire, he flogs himself, while in the meantime he's trying to convince the skeptical Hurons to convert.
Many have praised the film for its accuracies, while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages.
Black Robe's take on religion during this time period is smart, and illustrates some of the similarities between native and European beliefs while demonstrating the latter's contempt for native religion (the main character--"Black Robe," a term many Algonquians used both in the movie and in historical fact to describe the French Jesuit priests--is the primary example here).
I was recently given the Anchor Bay DVD release of this title as a present, and I have to say that while I am impressed with the usual European frankness about things that would never make it into American films, this is probably among the least of Paul Verhoeven's work.
It is so side splittingly funny, even 10 years & countless repeats later, that you hurt laughing while watching it.
Melchett simply has no idea of what life really is like for the troops on the front-line while he prattles on 35 miles behind the front-line in some safe palatial mansion where the most dangerous hazard to his life is whether he can unscrew a cork out of a champagne bottle without it hitting him in the face.
Blackadder Goes Forth is far more intelligent than a lot of sitcoms; the writing and acting is exceptionally good, and also underpins the true human sacrifice the millions of soldiers gave to their King & country while the smug & arrogant Generals went home to more medals, honours and riches than ever before.
I also had the strange thought while watching of how great it would have been to have Johnny and June Carter Cash playing the leads, since this film was made in their heyday.
His character is lonely but yet a naive and caring individual as he finds an ill pregnant woman (Olga Bellin) while working on a farm as a caretaker.
Years later he refuses to vote guilty while a member of the jury in murder trial, and this story explains why.
Currently I have been on a Stephen King movie rampage, and while they are creepy, I haven't come across one where all the details tie together as masterfully.
Appologies if some of this isn't coherent, I am watching 1408 while typing this submission.
Music suddenly stops...voices appear...sounds... after a while I wasn't all too sure any more whether the sound was coming from the movie... or from outside... not a nice experience during a movie like this one ;).
Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare.
But even though you realise this while watching it, the knowledge that your watching a 'haunted house' film washes away and the film completely draws you into its story and world.
A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence.
It has been a long while since I've attended a film that made the entire audience jump.
And now, "The Orphanage," from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.
Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.
Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger PrÃ­ncep plays the child SimÃ³n with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.
The tagline is correct, for while it is a story of horror, it is above all else a tale of love.
The story seems obvious; the clichÃ©-horror themes are there, and while I saw them coming, I was comfortable enough.
The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun's sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn't direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!)
At times their errors are amusing, and add something to the movie; at other times there has evidently been painstaking care taken to make the subtitles at least try to make sense - the attempt at translating a vocalised word-game is, while not perfect, a surprisingly good try.
Leaving our 4 bad guys in a situation they must find and gather money in any means possible, while getting into some strange events , which turn out to be some great highlights for the film.
Attack the Gas Station is a refreshing take on comedy that finds a very original and comical way to entertain its audience, while not wasting their time.
Its been a while since I've commented on IMDb, the only excuse I have for that is that no film in the past year or two has moved me, or even made me want to comment at all on here.
Marie and Pierre are jobless but while searching for a job, they take time to know themselves, to help each other and eventually to fall in love.
In fact, if you were to stumble across this episode while channel surfing you might think it was just some boring two-star family drama.
I would say that the film was pretty bizarre and I'm not sure if I could watch it again for a while but for someone like me who is interested in they ways of past decades, I think it was a brilliant peek into the late sixties.
I am Greek living in Geneva, Switzerland and everyday, I get together with my Greek and Turkish friends and we are watching it, while drinking a glass of ouzo or raki.
SCORPION'S REVENGE (1997; AKA Sasori In USA) Japanese interior designer (Yohko Saitoh), wrongly sent to an American cooler for the murder of her husband via exploding car, gets a flip through the back catalogue of women-in-prison movie indignities: delousings, showers, beatings, cafeteria catfighting, yard catfighting, a warden who quotes scripture while he brutalizes and rapes the fishies, raging American bull dykes, and an absolutely inhumane LACK OF PANTS!
The whole thing would have been more successful and excusable as a light comedy starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Holcroft, neatly missing numerous assassination attempts while managing to solve the entire mystery purely by accident.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
Well, Lora meets a handsome, injured bootlegger while working in emergency, who plays in this film later as she gets involved working duty caring for two sick little girls (who actually looked quite healthy to me!)
Therefore, the children are wasting away from starvation while a useless maid dithers around and Stanwyck tries to get the hospital to intervene.
The film would probably be instantly forgettable if not for the fierce performance of Stanwyck, who throws herself (quite literally) into the role of savior, taking punches, getting thrown into a wall, all while dishing out some punches of her own.
Least while for strange developments in your life all of this happens to take place in Bilbao, Spain.
Gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in Connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to "discover himself"; Chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young.
Michael Burns gives a non-performance that may one day be recommended by doctors as a cure for insomnia, while Foster fares little better as a dislikable female lead whose character seems to think she's free and happy but in reality is just a self-centred slut.
Harry Stradling, Jr.'s dewy, golden-hued cinematography gives the picture a sunny, beautifully lyrical look while the soundtrack boasts plenty of nicely harmonic and flavorsome folk ballads.
We learn those elements not in high-level drama but one of progressive mental torture going on in Marie's mind - particularly after Jean disappears beachside while Marie is basking on the sand.
This was so refreshing and beautiful to watch, a treat to be engulfed in picturesque Landes for a while.
Middle-aged Marie (luminous Charlotte Rampling making a belated but extremely welcome return to leading roles), an English literature professor at a Parisian university, quite literally loses her husband (hauntingly sad-eyed Bruno Cremer) while on seaside holiday.
They seem like a loving couple, but she is in her 40's, fit and trim while he was aging and overweight.
It is also hinted at during her conversation with her mother-in-law: the two of them trading insults over who will be the first to end up in a psychiatric home, while Ozon makes studies of the mother-in-law's aging features.
The film concentrates only on Marie and her denial of reality, her non-acceptance of the loss, which goes so far, that she i. e. sees Jean in the door while she sleeps with another man, Vincent.
They visit the beach the next day and while Marie is sunbathing, Jean goes for a swim - and never returns.
Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists.
Director Cosmatos, never one known for showing much tact, keeps the game of cat and mouse interesting for a good while until it just gets boring.
A pretty normal guy however, in this movie we get to enjoy the breakdown of his being while he has to come to terms with the forces of nature (or the Super Natural or Xeno Nature).
Moreover, the smart and trenchant script by Brian Taggert offers a potent, gripping and provocative allegory on "civilized" man's latent capacity for extreme violence and brutality needing the proper stimulus to be activated (the incredible conclusion with Weller chasing the rodent around his posh abode while brandishing a spiked baseball bat is both disturbing and exciting in comparable measure).
Peter Weller is always a great actor, and he stars in this film as Bart, a man who wages an all out war with one hell of an angry rat while the rest of his life begins to fall apart because of it.
Everyone needs a break from the constant political backbiting and drum beating once in a while and I appreciate his "fun" shows.
Paul Green, while some of his antics aren't typical of music teachers, really gets through to the kids.
At the end the girl confesses while the man doesn't - also at the end the Chinese interrogator is highly praised by his supervisor while the American interrogator goes home - quite unnoticed by anyone.
The problem with this film is that both scenarios use precisely the same dialog and this while initially effective gets pretty boring at the end.
Downright, the Predator is a thriller that entertains while being slick and fun with rousing tension.
During the rescue operation for instance, while we see them dismantling their opposition the camera doesn't just follow Arnold around, but it kind of keeps a running tab on all members of the team.
They battle for a while using weapons until it eventually comes down to Man against monster.
Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle.
The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy "futuristic" effects we are seeing today.
Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.
The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times.
Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title.
And the book's actually pretty interesting; there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie.
The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time.
the movie, while low key, is well written and one of the better and more sympathetic profiles of alcoholics that i've seen in recent memory.
Two hours flew by while I was watching this movie because I felt like I was there at Trees Lounge.
Nothing special, but if you like movies like me, then every once and a while a good independently made character film is enjoyable to watch.
Because both films are centered on the social life of a bar, comparison to Barbet Schroeder's i Barfly is inviting; but the latter's hero is a diamond in the rough, while the one here is just a schmegegge.
After hearing this film mentioned on steve buscemi's comentary while listening to Pine Barrens an episode of sopranos and felt i had to see it.
I should perhaps also give some praise to Buscemi for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want : Tommy want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , Tommy wants to take a woman he`s picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear .
Tommy's character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy.
It reminded me of a similar scene seen in the contorted, convolved "Baby of Macon" (the film that signed the end of my love for Greenaway) and I hated it, notwithstanding the evident difference, that being a scene of external violence while this is more a self-inflicted violence scene.
i am in grad school and i needed something to catch her attention while i work on papers and projects....i am almost finished and then it will go back in the movie pile so i can play more and read to her...but she just LOVES that little red guy.
This movie deals with sharing, while "Follow that Bird" deals with diversity.
It is unfortunate that Savior was not made before 1995, while the Bosnian War was still being fought, it would have definitely helped to open viewers' eyes to the reality of the war.
Once in a while one is just moved.
As an overall aesthetic choice, it does bring more immersiveness to the environment, but since 50% of the action takes place while you chop off the heads off random creatures, the metal beat of WW just felt more adequate (imo).
The same can be said from the chariot races that you can do once every while.
In Hitchcockian fashion, he tries to stay one jump ahead of the police while seeking the real killer.
Wow, did the filmmakers ever bother to take any courses in physics while they were in High School?
Enormous amounts of bullets are shot at each other while standing up and with the actors looking like they are watching TV.
The rest of the police is checking out their guns while the director zooms in on the guns triggers, red dots and what not.
)**Why isn't this on the bottom 100 with the rest of the cr*p?I mean this was so bad,it caused my brain to hurt and bleed.Here is how it began.It picks up where the first left off.Duwayne(spelling correction)and Belial have taken a steep fall from the hotel,and the paramedics pick them up; and place them on the ambulance.They arrive at the hospital to be treated,but they don't stay for long.A person disguised as a hospital worker kidnaps them both,and puts them in a van.She turns out to be Granny Ruth,and both she and her Granddaughter,run a boarding house for freaks.They're introduced first to a three armed gargoyle,with a really bizarre laugh.They are soon introduced to other creatures who are disabled in the "looks" department.One of them looks like it had an xylophone crammed up its mouth.Why does another one look like the symbol for "The Morton Downey Jr.Show"?Its basically a really large mouth that can sing opera,as Granny Ruth demonstrates.One looks like a giant maggot with glasses,another one looks almost like Swamp Thing.There's another one that was really hairraising,and one has to ask questions.What exactly did they do to Mac Tonight?He was a half moon man, that used to be shown on older McDonalds commercials back in the late 80's and early 90's.Was this supposed to be funny?Did they have something against him?It looks like they washed his face with a cheese grater,or an SOS pad.How rude!Then Belial is introduced to a female,reptilian freak named Eve who's an invalid.They later fall in LURVE with each other.Granny says she found her lying beside the road one day.I dunno,but I think she accidently backed over Eve with a Van,while she was crossing the street.Never mind.Duwayne develops a crush on Ruth's granddaughter,Susan,but she refuses his advances.We later see three other freaks,not introduced earlier.Two of them show up in a scene,where Duwayne is examining his scars.The male freak looks like a mouse,and his wife looks like something ripped off from "Troll".Another freak that really takes the cake is the frog one.This crossed eyed thing,is seen secretly looking at the reporter.Enough about the freaks,here's what I detest about the movie SO much.First, the freaks and monstrositys look down right stupid and poorly designed.Maybe it was intentional to be funny,or maybe the costume designer has the creativity and skill of a broom handle.Second,one has to question how some of the human freaks came to be;especially the ones like the mouse and frog.The story is weak with some plot holes,and scenes don't make any sense.The mouse freak says "Uh Oh!"
Together with her photographer Arty (Matt Mitler) she goes and sees Ruth, while there she also sees Duane and the potential for a really big story for herself.
There, Belial finds a female with the same bodily structure as him and falls in love while Duane plans on finally heading out on his own.
Over here in The Netherlands 'Renegade' was on TV for only a short while, but it has appealed many people here...
Potentially melodramatic, Argentinean director Adolfo Aristarain's (A Place in the World) Martin (Hache), handles the material with skill and intelligence and, while the dialogue often sounds like tedious psychodrama, impeccable performances by Luppi and Roth make Martin extremely watchable.
The results are stunning motion pictures that while addressing the intellect of the audience never fail to entertain as well.
Once Hache has moved in with his distant, cold, sullen father he falls under the influence of Alicia and Dante who adore him and attempt to show him a life of sunshine in Madrid while MartÃ­n sequesters himself in his writing.
i could actually taste/smell times square while watching.
The trailers give away a big part of the problem: the 1982 release stresses the Godfather and Apocalypse Now as evidence of Coppola's genius while the 2003 reissue trailer runs off a list of critical superlatives in a sternly unemotional voice: joy isn't on the menu here.
This is one of those rare movies where the cinematography (by the incomparable Vittorio Storaro) and the music (by the equally incomparable Tom Waits, probably his most beautiful bunch of songs and instrumentals ever recorded) warranted (and for the latter received) some Oscar nominations, while the script warranted a golden raspberry.
Scenes were added that actually take away from the film while a few favorite spots have been cut out.
Every once in a while, Coppola gives us a glimpse of his more passionate side.
The mellow, mesmerising tune of the theme music by Edouard Dubois made me watch this movie twice while on a transcontinental flight.
The film's beginning and end revolve around affirmation of marital bonds, while the bulk of the film (to me only the sub-plot) ventures into transgression of those bonds followed by redemption.
The young man has an affair with the woman, and is clearly drawn toward the man as while.
seem to operate on a logic all their own, that is, the logic of Mr. Marins himself, and while I can't say much about truly understanding what's going on in most cases, they do make for a fascinating watch.
This is a shame, because while his films aren't for everybody, psychotronic fans will love them.
It was his contention that Kathleen slipped and fell on a staircase in their home after an evening of wine and relaxation, while the prosecution maintained that Mr. Peterson had bludgeoned his wife, and positioned the body to appear as an accident.
He sure doesn't look comfortable serenading the heroine or warbling a tune while riding across the prairie.
While most will think, as I did, while reading the plot synopsis of the film that it is a rip-off of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Sutherland starred in the remake of this film in 1978), the actual book was published in 1951, prior to the original film as well as the novel written by Jack Finney.
See this film; it's a great release and will keep you inspired for a while.
Pictures of these soldiers are shown while Hawthorne describes their fate, briefly but very movingly.
It also presents one of the most haunting images of misery that I have seen: the face of a Soviet soldier who is wearily eating while on the march, and who looks towards the camera.
"Seems Like Old Times" showcases Neil Simon doing what Neil Simon does best: creating harmless, solid little comedies that don't tax the intellect or give you much to remember, but which are pleasant enough while you're actually watching them.
Hawn is the wife of the L.A. district attorney (Charles Grodin), while Chase is the ex-husband who comes tumbling (literally) back into her life when he finds himself in a desperate situation.
The actors are excellent, as is the funny supporting cast, and there are some hilarious scenes as Chase hides out in a room above the garage and, while under the bed, his hand extending a little, Grodin stands on his finger as he argues with Hawn.
So what you get is an alien invasion story where all the leads get "infected" by the aliens but are somehow saved by their friends while scores of infected extras get mowed down by machine-gun fire.
As the story begins, Nick is forced by two criminals to participate in a bank robbery and when they let him go (albeit while their vehicle is in motion), Nick figures Glenda - who he's never stopped loving - will be the only one willing to help him.
I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while Grodin was sitting on it.
That film dealt with Cary Grant as a fugitive being hidden in a house by Jean Arthur, while jurist Ronald Colman (just nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court) is renting the same house from Arthur.
Stars Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, and Charles Grodin are at their best, while the supporting cast also does an excellent job.
While most will think, as I did, while reading the plot synopsis of the film that it is a rip-off of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Sutherland starred in the remake of this film in 1978), the actual book was published in 1951, prior to the original film as well as the novel written by Jack Finney.
I thought he was in the top 5 SNL cast members ever, and it was always a mystery to me why Adam Sandler & Chris Rock (fair-to-middling SNL alumni IMO) became stars while some of the true comedic geniuses like Phil Hartman and Dana Carvey didn't get top roles.
I don't find his fake Italian accent as annoying as many of the reviewers, but how the hell is repeating the word "turtle" over and over again while dressed in a turtle suit to get into a turtle club supposed to be funny, let alone plausible in the plot?
Once in a while a student film comes along that has a well written story, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful acting.
Meanwhile, Derek wishes for his mom to escape a verbally abusive marriage while gaining some guts of his own.
At any rate, the movie was entertaining and you gotta love the idea of a werewolf that rips your lungs out through your mouth and talks trash while he does it.
They loaded up the scenes with wolf fodder and we only got to see two gory deaths while the rest were implied.
Unfortunately while there they are attacked by the same Werewolf creature that killed Scott, only Derek & his friend Sam (Kimberly J.
OK soi found this in wal mart ...and for fathers day i said hey get me that ...lol... and im glad ... it was a good change of pace for genre ....cursed was cool and a good film because of the changes they made to the idea ... and this film was the same ...a funny p issed off wolf guy ..making jokes while killing people and the gore was pretty good .... better than expected ... im saying a full 10 here it had it all ... a funny bad guy ( not cheesy to much), good gore, naked chicks (can never go wronge there) story line was pretty good and the acting wast bad .... so i say if your into the whole angry wolf guy killing maiming and "touching people in the bad place" ....lol..then check it out (4), vocalist - GOD IN A MACHINE
The villain, while always a pretty nasty guy, had been struggling to control his 'problem' and had actually been quite successful until the daft teens got involved.
A visit from Uncle Charley leads Sam into a situation that jeopardizes her relationship with Derek while uncovering the truth about Mitchell and putting all their lives in danger.
Rather, they're merely a backdrop upon which countless hand-to-hand fights and slapstick humor are placed, and while they're not necessarily thought-provoking, they are by no means a waste of time to individuals who enjoy more intellectual entertainment.
Yes, it's a knock-off of "Deliverance" (good movie also), but this movie is worth your while.
Clu Galager kicks ace for a while much like in Return of the Living Dead, and I think he is wearing the same jacket.
It cÃ³uld have been very innovative if it wasn't for the developer turning this game into a semi-puzzel/platform game every once in a while.
And while you will have the will to take more chances ( which is good ) you know that there really is no problem with dying.
Along the way you earn a power called spirit walking, you leave your body in a state of meditation while you do what you have to do with your spirit, and you shoot with guns that will blow your mind.
Oh yeah, they can be used as a door andÂ..as aÂ.and aÂ..okay, well the use of portals in this game, while interesting, not very well done.
Opponents, most twisted and delectably incorrect in the political department, deploy excellent animation, and while obviously inspired by those from the aforementioned shooter franchises and even the Matrix movies, are engrossing in engagement and leave a lasting, entertaining impression.
As always Jackie does some amazing stunts, and the scene where Jackie and Tyson(Teddy Robin Kwan) escape on the boat is pretty exciting, plus while some of the humor is incredibly silly I couldn't help but laugh at it.
Childress wants Robin so bad that he stages a shootout while they're in Israel and attempts to kill Peter (His son thinks he's dead).
A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son.
The characters are perfect, Dr Lucien Sanchez has got to be the best character on the small comedy screen for a while.
What comes out is a weird mixture of doctor-cops who run around a cursed hospital with guns trying to deal with all sorts of spooky occurrences and creepy creatures (while having to deal with the burden of daily admin).
The series is set in a hospital which is built upon a gateway to hell, which Garth Marenghi's character opened once a short while ago with a friend with a dubious background.
His improv skills seem to have been allowed to run riot throughout and while the majority of his lines aren't necessarily funny, when they're delivered in Ayaode's distinctive voice, they become side splitting.
The soldier is illiterate while the General is an understandably a well-read individual.
The film even goes on to make a hero of a donkey, while conversation revolves around tasty donkey-meat.
I found out different a few hrs ago while in my search to find this movie.
What this film portrays so well is that parents and their children may have different outlooks and priorities and they may come into passionate conflict as a result - but they can do so while the mutual love, trust, and respect endures.
But the new kid in town played by an amazing Kevin Bacon is about to defy that rule and get the minister's daughter while he's at it.
There, while falling in love with the Reverend's daughter (Lori Singer), he finds out that there is a law against dancing in this town(!
This movie is up there with 80's `classics' like `Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids, we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought: `What a crap movie.'
He went outside of his norm, while keeping with the patented Burns seal of approval.
Heather Graham flip-flops between decent and poor, while Brittany just seems like she isn't acting, but instead just playing "herself".
Sidwalks of New York was a film I was urging myself to see for a while.
When John plays piano, Boomer watches while his fingers wriggle to a mysterious rhythm.
The plot takes on many shifts in loyalty and focus, keeping the attention, while a chase through underground tunnels lends the requisite chase an extra air of tension.
There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about.
And, while in parts it is awfully silly, the overall effort was far better than I expected and was one of the better Chan movies I have seen.
No strong, self-aware human being should ever need to put up with getting literally kicked around, which Steven is smart enough to already know, which his why he can ride off into the sunset loveless but confident - such a liberated ending (while no 'happily-ever-after' romance) more than validates the occasional 'after-school-special' moments that preceded it.
Steven wants to be open about the relationship, while John wants to hide his love for Steve.
I normally wouldn't bother writing a review for a made for TV movie, but I got stuck watching while at home for Christmas.
Get it while you can.
Watch it while your doing something else like waxing your car.
The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping & absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police & FBI, although I have to say once Harry is arrested & stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably.
He was wry and unsophisticated while being just close enough to the edge to keep you guessing if he was cunning or just a psychopath.
I will add the following...one of the things that I found most annoying is the fact that Arquette is frequently seen holding a camera while another camera is filming her holding the camera.
Typical of the series, Tanner is on the one hand shallow and full of empty rhetoric, while also sincere, idealistic and sometimes inspiring.
And all the while Murphy is a total pro- robbed of an Emmy severely in fact- and there ends up being more for him to do as an actor, in playing a sympathetic but flawed character who as TJ describes about his running for president is like a "lifestyle choice."
And it has the immediacy of news while keeping a hold on the multi-dimensional framework that Altman mastered in his career.
So while the family represents a similar idea of continuity as the trees, of the species being reproduced, it sis also offered in stark contraast to them, as each member of the trio will eventually die, for all the nourishment and fertility, while nature lives on, indifferent.
Ironically, immortality has been conversely guarenteed - while the man behind the camera is lost, fading into a mere eye, a role taken over by every viewer, the actor brother is trapped forever in this rigid, simple domestic scenario, feeding the ever-hungry, unthinking baby, a harbinger of the medium he invented.
They explained how a villain's face is drawn with many extreme sharp angles, while the faces of good characters are drawn with much more gentle curves.
I do not know way too many things about artistic side of the actors and how they suppose to act while a movie, but I know this: I've been in bondage and God has set me free This is what the movie industry should be all about.
Kimberly brings a new definition to pathos, and in several scenes proves that she's an actress of great skill and technique, while never allowing the mechanics to be noticed.
In the ensuing confrontation one of the men holds the big guy from behind while the other (Ariel Neel Auguste, played by Emir Kusturica) knocks the knife from his hand, picks it up, and in a kind of madness cuts the man open to see--as they later testify at the trial--whether he is really fat or just big.
When Pauline is sitting practically on Neel's lap while teaching him to read, the camera closes in on their fingers as they trace the lines in the text.
Nell, who stabbed the victim, is sentenced to die with his head severed in the guillotine while Louis is sentenced to hard labor.
As the best of French cinema does so adroitly, "The Window of Saint-Pierre" tells most of it's story laconically with knowing looks and subtle behaviors while the story it tells is a relentlessly plodding drama of unspoken words and the emotions they evoke.
During a reading lesson, their fingers brush while scanning a page.
her subtle device is her hand-held camcorder that is both the source of some footage and an insulator between herself and the interviewee--removing most of the congeniality that surely exists while allowing her subjects to speak frankly without pretense.
Levy is perfect as the bumbling salesman whose dreams peak at the hope of having a standing ovation for his presentation on the latest dentistry tools in his text-book nerd attire and over-indulgence in self-obsessed righteousness; while Jackson is impeccable as the rouge untrusting, seen-too-much undercover agent rotely implementing his down-to-a-science head-banging and snitch chasing, which brings purpose to his life but of which the passion and excitement of it all elude him.
On the other hand, while Anu Malik does a bad job with the composition of the songs, the composers Sandeep Chowta and Ranjit Barot weave a superb musical score seamlessly into the film.
One day while in exile, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful runaway princess names Kaurwaki (played to the best of her ability by Kareena Kapoor, considering that this role was supposed to be for Aishwarya Rai who personifies the meaning of beauty more than Kapoor ever could) and after a few song and dance numbers, they marry each other in the deserted forests.
In the end, while the film quality is lacking at times, the acting, music and flamboyantly dramatic direction make this an incredible film, and a favourite of mine.
While Monsoon Wedding was a great film, it was in a format I was comfortable with...while Asoka gave me something new.
Asoka's mother orders him to leave Magadha to save his life, and while traveling, he meets Princess Kaurwaki (Karriena Kapoor) and her brother, Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) from Kalinga, who are undercover and protected by General Bheema (Rahul Dev).
Kareena Kapoor, as the warrior princess who acts as sister and mother figure to Arya, a cautious then enduring lover to Asoka and emerges as someone on her own personal journey, in search of her identity and sense of belonging while juggling her duties, heart and mind in a three ring circus, Kareena gives what is by far her finest performance to date.
Johnny Harris plays his role well as the pimp who constantly looks out for himself, of bowing to authority and pressure, while Nathan Constance as his chum actually had a lot more characterization going on for him instead.
As London to Brighton begins, two hysterical young girls hide in a public toilet in London's Victoria Station in the middle of the night The younger girl, possibly only 11 or 12, her face smeared with lipstick and bruises, cries copious tears while the older, chubbier girl tries to comfort her though her own face is a mass of welts and black and blue marks.
Now on the run, Kelly leaves Joanne in the rest room while she does some "work" to obtain money to visit a safe house in Brighton.
If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught.
But as the story unfolds we grow to like both the key characters because they have been forced into their predicament, and while they will be helpless for much of their plight their spirit will hold and eventually ring true.
Kelly leaves Joanne in the toilet while she scores tricks to raise money for train tickets to Brighton.
Sharukh Khan and Twinkle Khanna were good working together.Shahrukh Khan is a detective and while he is doing his detective work he falls in love with Twinkle Khanna.
Col. Scott says to him over the radio,"You wait right up there Joe, while I play Dixie on these two buck tooth pals of yours."
Now it's a while ago and I think I can do it.
Some of them help the agents while others try to kill the agents.
And while it's doing it, it addresses the AIDS stigma, problems prevalent in the lives of sex workers and doesn't really pull punches while doing so.
It manages to avoid the worst of the clichÃ©s, stay in the genre and play it straight, make an impact and wrap in commentary on real social issues while making of solid dramatic entertainment.
And while the details were nice for a while, there were times when they were just useless and frustrating.
When they ported back out she appeared holding the staff while the fighter/lord guy was carrying her.
The acting, while not Oscar worthy, was perfectly reasonable work from a handful of unknowns.
The uproariously inappropriate hip, mellow, finger-snapping cocktail lounge score takes the viewer straight to aural groovesville while the ratty, scratchy photography further spices up the film's fantastically lurid'n'loopy sense of blithely unapologetic degeneracy and the maladroitly jumping back and forth fragmented narrative eschews continuity in favor of a peculiarly becoming "what the hell's going on here?
It is also a shame on producer Andy Vajna to have discredited the suicidal courage of the revolutionists by applying his Âhow-to-make-a-stupid-action-packed-blockbuster" kit while putting Children of Glory together.
In Budapest, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 is beginning while the water polo team is training for the Melbourne Olympic Games.
1956 means something for everyone who has at least a little percentage of Hungarian blood in his/her veins... either you were here afterwards and saw the aftermath, either you live here now as young and have the same needs, feelings for freedom, or you're living abroad and were raised on stories about Hungary and how your family had to live, run through the border while they were shooting at them... Or you've heard about the story, you know someone who's Hungarian.
Levy's job is to ramble on about banalities, while Jackson's job is to roll his eyes at him.
Instead, forth-billed (after Claudia Cardinale and Hardy Kruger) Peter Finch takes the lead as General Nobile, whose ill-fated 1928 airship expedition to the North Pole, intended to boost Fascist Italy's international prestige, instead ended ingloriously with the survivors stranded on melting ice packs for weeks while inertia, lack of initiative and the poor chain of command resulted in buck-passing, recriminations and destroyed reputations rather than rescue attempts.
It is her bitter confrontation with Nobile after he has been safely brought back to King's Bay while the others were left freezing on the ice, that is the beginning of his sleepless nights.
Meanwhile, Tuggle doesn't stop as a director in giving this about as dark a look as possible, and with the sexuality, while sleazy (where else will you see women wrestling all oiled up and refereed by a midget named Shorty), is also effective for the mood.
Writer/director Richard Tuggle relates the compellingly sordid plot at a gradual, yet steady pace, develops a good deal of tension, delivers a vivid and intriguing evocation of the seamy Big Easy red light district, and, most of all, offers a strong and provocative exploration of the extremely warped and disturbing aspects of severely aberrant male sexuality and perversity (for example, Block likes to handcuff woman while making love to them in order to have a sense of control).
How did the killer manage to find a shovel on a grave yard, while Eastwood was chasing him?
I thought about it for a while, and reminded myself that the monks had agreed to be filmed, and were not being filmed surreptitiously.
This is the best film I've seen for capturing the kind of life one lives in primitive isolation -- a life I was lucky enough to live for a while myself.
Motes of dust in shafts of sunlight, the sound a pair of scissors make while cutting through cloth, the physical stamina needed to complete labor, the taste of the most common repasts: all become all-encompassing, without addictive modern society to suck at one's soul.
And while these Monks do give up everything they own, the nature that surrounds them are so breathtakingly priceless that one longs to stay in that peaceful serene place in the French Alps.
And while there's beauty in the physical aspects of both the natural world in its changing seasons as well as the cloistered setting, it's the tranquil beauty of faces that rivet.
These Hermit/Monks are not walking through their Cloister with Stereo Earphones, while their cowled heads bob up and down in rhythm with the latest HIP-HOP Beat!!
A routine business trip from Wisconsin to Detroit turns into an unexpected case of mistaken identity for Andy Fiddler (Levy), a dental supply salesman, while heading to a convention.
Both discover that they can learn from one another, with Andy teaching Derrick to be more trusting and more appreciative of family values, while Derrick teaches Andy to be more assertive.
Madonna's videos are no stranger to awards either, "Take A Bow" received the AMA and the MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, while "Ray Of Light" won MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, also helped usher in one of Madonna's first four Grammy's!  
Now the 2 pilots must face ultimate evil while trying to escape the B-17.
There's even alien drug use(a cocaine type drug called Nyborg, we actually witness the hallucinations the aliens have while driving their ship to a space station)!
Tales include a New York City cabbie of the future, with a disintegrating beam loaded in his car for anyone who tries an attempt to harm or rob him, who gets mixed up with a mysterious dame holding the orb and gangsters desiring to possess it, a young boy transformed into a muscular warrior who must defend a blond dame against a seemingly unkillable king and evil witch both vying for the orb, a navy crew being turned into creepy skeleton monsters by the orb during WWII while the fighter captain must abort for a spot on Earth where other ships have wrecked not knowing what lies in wait for him, a crew of aliens responsible for human mutations thanks to the orb in their possession with a robotic captain who kidnaps a Jewish hottie hoping to marry her, and a battle between orb infected human monsters and a female warrior from an ancient race.
Yet they were legitimate private eyes, combining their unique talents to solve the mystery while making us smile along the way.
Jeff Goldblum was awesome and cute in portraying his character's naivetÃ© while Vereen showed his comic side very well with the witty dialog all the actors were blessed to perform .
I had gotten to the point where I could mimic that line while It was being said.
Avery excels and, while his subsequent output would be crammed full of defining masterpieces, it's only a shame 'Page Miss Glory' seems to have got lost in the shuffle.
All over the world, senior actresses are forced to retreat into the background while the juicy parts go to the younger women.
Gulzar has excellently directed the movie while adorning it with passionately electrifying emotional focus during certain scenes.
Sen displays both coolness and a pinch of arrogance while playing the strong politician, yet convincingly switches it with warmth and cordiality when she becomes a suffering woman or a wife.
Once on the military base, Abbott tries to be serious, while Costello somehow manages to do everything wrong, often incurring their drill sergeant's wrath.
There were several good skits involving the boys and while not their best work, it still is pretty fresh and well worth watching.
And while musical interludes usually seem to intrude in the comedy flow, hearing and seeing such numbers like the Oscar-nominated "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B", "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four", and "Apple Blossom Time" performed by Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne just add to the rousing enjoyment.
Some criticism has been directed at the duo for the insertion of superfluous and usually second-rate musical numbers in most of their films--a decision made by Universal Pictures which the team had no control over--and while that may be true for several of their subsequent efforts, it isn't here.
Anyone who thinks that Bud Abbott wasn't the best straight man in the business should watch the Drill routine and check out how he consistently and skillfully reins in Costello whenever Lou's manic energy takes him too far outside the skit while still allowing him the freedom to employ the ad-libs and improvisations he was famous for.
Petty con artists, the duo mistakenly join the Army while trying to evade local police.
We saw this on HBO back in 1984, as high school juniors, one night while high on acid.
As he often does Poirot just happens to be on the seen when a very filthy rich American heiress, the Paris Hilton of the Thirties is shot and killed while on a honeymoon on a Nile cruise.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
As for the characters, while it is a valid argument, I understand that it's the way Christie wrote.
A spectacular all-star cast came together for this intriguing film about a murder on a steamer boat while traveling down the longest river in the world, the Nile.
The most surprising thing that I found while watching the movie are the multiple death scenes featured in this 'supposed' PG-rated film.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
2) The logic in this movie is flawless and everything is CLEARLY explained, while in "Murder in the Orient Express" Poirot reached many ARBITRARY conclusions.
You won't guess either ending, but it takes a brilliant person (like Poirot) to guess the ending here, while it takes a magician to guess the ending there.
3) "Murder on the Orient Express" is somewhat claustrophobic, while "Death on the Nile" contains many more scenes filmed in beautiful natural locations.
He has a wonderful way of gaining the confidence and trust of each of his suspects, while probing them for information.
Poirot tries to figure out who did it while the bodies start to pile up....  Visually beautiful and totally fascinating adaptation of an Agatha Christie mystery.
An heiress is murdered while honeymooning on a Nile cruise.
Lyddie is one of my favorite books for quite a while now, so when I found the film on video I decided to get it.
When I come across Midnight Run while channel surfing, I always stop and stick (if it's the uncut version)...instant velcro.
DeNiro is perfection incarnate as the angry ex-cop with honor, Grodin is a loveable goof while maintaining his classic dead-pan, and all of the multiple supporting characters are great and well used by Martin Brest.
"Midnight Run" is a highly entertaining action/comedy movie with a heart, and if you have half the fun, watching it, as the actors obviously had while doing it, then you will have already enjoyed yourself a whole lot more than in any other movie that is "similar" to this one.
The scene while they are getting chased by the helicopter is outstanding.
He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time, while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.
He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing.
Anyway, THIS movie, while rather lengthy, is upbeat, action-packed, and pretty funny, as the swaggering De Niro and the very dry Grodin display perfect odd-couple chemistry.
Aerobics class became the next singles hang-out as the song "Masquerade" blares out, while everyone obsesses over plastic surgery and the perfect body (The Laraine Newman character is particularly pathetic).
The ending wasn't great either--Berlin's 'Masquerade' song (which is, in my opinion, a weak link in the film's soundtrack), plays on while ALL of the key characters do aerobics...Is that realistic?
Perfect is the story of a Rolling Stone reporter (Travolta) who trips over his ethics, or lack there of while writing two big stories.
It's a rare bit of symbolism from Griffith and while not particularly subtle it was quite a novelty for the time.
And it does sum up the message of the picture, the same as that of Fort Apache; that Native Americans, while being traditional antagonists of the Western genre, should never be underestimated.
And the subject of writer/director Jacquot's scrutiny is a headstrong, independent young woman who, while acknowledging her vulnerability in the face of several personal crises, refuses to sit idly by and play the victim.
As John Lennon once wrote, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."
She is on screen all the time as the camera follows her constantly while she walks down the corridors of the hotel, in the elevator, walking down the streets.
However, Andy is a guy that Reuben has always been fond of, so Reuben decides to give him 1 hour to do whatever he wants and come to peace with his life, while staying under Reuben's supervision of course.
Quaid's hit man is kind, thoughtful, and contemplative all the while simmering with potential violence, while occasionally flashing a glimpse of the goofy grin we first saw from him in Peter Bogdanovich's 'The Last Picture Show'.
Even as events unfold in real time, there is a surreal timelessness evoked as we glide along dilapidated streets, with Reuben as our guide, while a radio station that will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has a soft spot for 70s Can Con plays innocently along the way.
These two men know how to make a documentary that looks at both sides of our oil needs and industry while not knocking our addictive behavior towards gasoline.
I saw clips of the movie on the internet and I was amazed on how they were funny, especially the scene when Candy unintentionally almost destroys the entire police station while trying to find a pencil or when he hilariously fails his shooting test in the gun range.
I was tired enough to nod off while watching it, but the cold and careful facts started seeping down my neck until I was almost in a state of shock.
The film has been successful enough up to this point that we really *want* to see these two finally get together (well, back together), and we're really curious to see just how it's going to happen, and so the film teases and tantalizes us for a while at the end.
Highlights include Grant playing the piano while Mr. Smith (the dog) does a barking routine, but Dunne gets her chance, singing "Gone with the Wind" at a high-toned party.
Cary Grant player Jerry Warriner, am man to whom we are introduced while he is in a tanning bed to help provide the alibi that he was on vacation in Florida.
The "fourth wall" is gone; the movie rides so high and smart that we as audience can be subtly acknowledged throughout and made complicit in the production, while we continue to believe in the characters and care about what happens to them.
Interrupted by a visitor while advising the fiancÃ© on where it would good to sink a shaft (har!
Nevertheless, Peterson is actually the main reason I kept laughing while watching the film.
It's been a while since their last adventure.
They soon have puppies and the kids follow Beethoven to see what he's up to and they find little Beethoven's, there all so sweet and they take them home and don't say nothing about it, for a while and the parents find out and the father says they can keep them until they can find homes for them, well I don't want to tell you the whole story so go out and see it, you will not be disappointed.
Au contraire, vraiment - while the cinematography, setting, music and pacing are more or less good, many of the actors overact their characters to the point of becoming caricatures instead.
Have you ever met someone and it just clicked and while it was clicking you spent a day or three in bed?
These two people devour each other sexually and while they do, passion blossoms and intimacy becomes more and more desirable.
Buy this movie now, you will not regret it, but watch it with a lover because watching it while you're single will make you jones too much for the real thing and that could be depressing.
This repetitive nature of the plot gets frustrating after a while.
Both, of course, have been around a while and both have copped awards, Carre, a Best Actress Cesar for Se Souvenirs des belles choses (another outstanding film that was let down by the public) and Gamblin in Tavernier's own recent masterpiece Laissez-Passer, but somehow they've never received the recognition they deserve and it may be that they'll be denied this time around too.
They think they have beaten democracy with their guard down, but in actuality they just turned a blind eye to the fact that one man could single-handedly have the fortitude to take down an entire cell by himself while his fellow agents think he is crazy, and a little friendly coincidence that every person he runs into has video footage of the exact moments necessary to put the puzzle together.
Ultimately VANTAGE POINT is half the film it could have been, it lacks sufficient character motivation or back story, the characters are caricatures, the script is diluted to the point of meaningless and while it sports a great climatic car chase, the final scene is as implausible as they come-----a highly trained band of ruthless conspirators, toting the latest in high tech gadgetry, killing co-conspirators as they see fit, assisted by an inside man, successfully pull off TWO intricate operations and on the road to getting away scot-free, only to be undone because an irrelevant character JAYWALKS!
I first caught the film on TV decades ago and, while I didn't clearly remember the specifics of the plot (of which there's very little) until I caught it on TV again last night, I vividly remembered the corpses skulking about the screen.
Other creepy elements: corpses being made to blow out birthday cake candles for a young girl (as if anyone would want a cake with corpse-breath all over it) and, shortly thereafter, the same corpse inadvertently cutting off its own finger while slicing the cake.
French mime/actor Marcel Marceau plays the title role of Malcolm Shanks, a deaf mute puppeteer who scratches out a living putting on shows for children, while bearing the brunt of a miserable home life with his money grabbing brother and sister-in-law, who take all the money he earns for themselves.
In fact, call me crazy, but I will bet that Burton has seen this film before and was possibly inspired by it while making his own film.
He's interested in photography and one day while taking pictures in the woods he runs into Satonaka Shizuru, a quirky waif and classmate, adorably played by Aoi Miyazaki.
It took me a little while to get used to Hiroshi's Tamaki's performance, I felt he overplayed the awkwardness of his character in the beginning.
He then proceeds to daydream (while obviously polishing or sanding the wood down to nothing) about the professions open to him if he pursues industrial arts (all of which are equally depressing).
Minor spoiler:  My favorite part: when the ship course is changed, and the people on the bridge get thrown all over by the abrupt directional/speed variation while the characters all over the rest of the ship are completely unaware anything had happened.
You get many conventional subplots: * good prince is turned into a baboon while his evil stepmother wants to see her own son becoming Calif. * belle princess in love with the brave sailor Sinbad.
This picture does not suffer in the same way, as both acting and dialogue, while nothing special, are better here.
As her mother walked away, weeping, telling Young-ju that she will be going to the restroom for a while, Young-ju told Victoria that everybody hated her because she is not Korean.
Anyway, while not a film that I would rate as a "can't miss", "Good-bye, My Lady" was a fun film that had it's touching moments, but mixed in a lot of fun.
Few visuals work, and the racy T&A (and while you're at it.
Lastly, "La Femme Nikita" has some of the most stylized and violent action scenes of any movie I've seen in a while.
Only shining moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a dainty hat.
It's been a while since I've seen the 1970 original and I can't remember if I really liked it or not.
And the Swiss-cheese plot seems to be designed solely to use as much footage from other films and stock agencies(there's that mushroom cloud again)as possible while incorporating a handful of soft core sex scenes and a few gore effects.
People start to die and no one knows what the hell is going on (or how they got there) but still make time to have sex while secret video cameras tape them.
The film has been compared to a Looney Tunes version of a Quentin Tarantino film, and while its partly true, it has to be remembered that Tarantino has been raiding the work of filmmakers like Stephen Chow for years and telling people its his own stuff.
It not very often that I go to the same movie twice while it's in the theaters, but this one was so good I almost stayed through another showing of it on the same night.
Just don't expect realism... the movie had a strange impact on me - it seemed predictable in retrospect, but it was nothing of the sort, while I was watching it.
In fact, it effortlessly turned corners I didn't really see were there, all the while regularly introducing new interesting and colorful characters for our entertainment.
So while the film was overall one of the funniest I've seen in recent memory, there were a couple of great moments of highly stylized action.
It took me a while to figure out who the hero was.
For example, when Chow shows his characters practising kung-fu while faced by a middle-aged woman in the slum, he is quickly kicked in the groin.
It maintains the previous Chow's style and humor as in other movies, such as "Xi Ju Zhi Wang" and "Xing Yun Yi Tiao Long", while those CGIs were not expected.
Chow's comedic timing gets better and better with every movie he makes, and while his films are depending more and more on CGI these days, and makes this movie much more a fantasy kung fu film than a traditional one, it hardly detracts from the enjoyable experience.
You know, I've never been a big fan of rap culture, but I thought that the film in question, "Stop Snitchin', Stop Lying", while it does have some incredibly stupid and/or unintentionally hilarious parts, actually was enjoyable enough for me to watch all the way through.
More than the average 3 it currently received while I wrote this review.
I saw this movie on Sci-Fi a while ago and it sucked.
In the way back home, in a lack of attention of David while driving, he hits Fawn (Elena Lyons) on the road.
It was so telling how the older sons had names that weren't even really names, merely descriptions, while the younger sons had actual names as though they were the true human beings.
The costumes, the sets, the crowds of colorful extras constantly dazzle the eye, while Sullivan's captivating and rousing music was never more superbly rendered than it is here by the London Symphony Orchestra.
The only thing I skip while watching this movie is the song "Khudko maar daala re" which is a signature of RGV production.
However he becomes a witness to a killing a nd is put under pressure to not testify by a crime boss, while being forced on the other side by the law to point out the culprits in a line-up.
Many people may label her as "eccentric", "odd" and "rebellious", and while she has been all of these things, she strikes me most as being INTELLIGENT..in fact probably TOO intelligent compared to most people.
Personal highlights in the film: Berlin's pained return to the Chelsea hotel and the bankruptcy of trying to revisit the past / The examination of a jam-packed apartment with fastidiously organized Polaroid pictures / The penis book / The tone-for-tone reperformance of lousy, bourgeois parenting lectures / And of course Brigid's failure to resist Key Lime pie, while representing (to her) a major personal failure, is the funniest thing in the whole movie.
It is very interesting how the film's release is timed - while the US is still in Iraq.
It never gets stupid, and, while it moves quickly, it isn't too fast, either.
A few scenes could have been edited to preserve the epic feel while maintaining the film's pace.
Lee Van Cleef gives a persuasively pugnacious performance as Max's right-hand gunman, while Ted de Corsia is given enough evil things to do to qualify as a thorough-going villain.
Another asked if we really needed ANOTHER homage to Hitchcock since De Palma's been doing it for years; however, one look at De Palma's films and THIS film and the difference is night and day: De Palma's films, which could be considered almost a Hyper-Hitchcock, are almost TOO jokey and slavish to its directors flights of fancy, while Benton's film exhibits the cool reserve, almost detachment, of its sophisticated New York settings.
It contains all the old cliches like dying soldiers making a speech just before they draw their last breath and as soon as someone is tasked to do something dangerous they`ll do it in a completely blase manner then die in a blackly comical famous last words scene .There`s some corny dialogue from the American characters like " Holy cow , check out those crazy beefeaters " while the Brits are all stiff upper lipped .
(several stories in local papers) He appeared on stage along with the showing of Black Magic,(Vanity Theatre) in Windsor Ontario Canada while a student to demonstrate hypnosis.
The less annoying one (Wallace Shawn) is in awe of how brilliant Andre is, while I felt that Andre was mostly full of crap.
What could be more enjoyable than having a cup of coffee while reading the morning's paper?
Roger Ebert called this 'the only movie without clichÃ©s", and while it's not completely true(what really could be), it does manage to invert any expectations of characterization or plot.
Once they actually get into the dialogue it becomes apparent the script has vast layers to it, it essentially is a comment on modern existence and the conflicting views held by people, it uses the two characters in the film as symbols of society; Andre representing the new age thinking, while Wallace represents the rational scientific mind and shows the conflicting desire of wanting to retreat back to primitive living to find our humanity but also wanting to enjoy the benefits modern society grants us.
And while visuals, attractive actors, special effects and over-the-top action adds value to a film, it however does not define a film.
Not only is this film a character study, but the single-setting idea was taken a step further because for two hours while your whole notion of the outside world is erased you do not see a single house nor a single room, but a single table.
The next part is Wallace responding to all of this, and the final part consists of Andre and Wallace basically agreeing to disagree, all while dining at a fine restaurant.
What exactly were the Communist authorities doing while Andre, an American, had several dozen Polish citizens out in the woods carrying on a theatre workshop?
Why was it that the practical matter of making a living, and the costs of world travel while not working, didn't seem to impede Andre from traveling around the world, or even seem to enter his mind?
I pontificated about my belly button lint while Louis Malle didn't even make up for subjecting me to Wallace Shawn's whine-tastic introduction.
Wallace Shawn is the less traveled, non-pretentious friend, while Andre discusses his travels to India, Poland, Scotland, and the many philosophies he has encountered therein.
Andre subtly criticizes Wally several times in the film (note what Andre says about people who stuff their face out of habit while Wallace is eating; also notice that we hardly ever see Andre himself eat).
Worse, while he dumped the woman's body back on the train before it left, Mike Bennett (Dale Belding), a kid who likes to get away from his mother and have adventures, saw him Even worse, after Dunlap gets picked up while hitchhiking and realizes he can't leave the area because of the flooding, the friendly driver lets him off at the only place to stay in town, a boarding house.
Of course, Alex lives a life of ultra-violence, while Bruce is a perfectly calm and reasonable individual.
Although shot with digital technique it is enjoyable to watch: locations were picked with a very good sense, while cinematography is really pure.
There are at least two lines from these comparisons that are very laugh out loud funny, while making points about the 1968 of protests, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
The owner returns while they're there and recognizes the girl.
"The Edukators" is one way of doing all those things from the cinema screen by telling the story of three rebel young guys that won't stay and look without doing a thing while the big corporations destroy this world and turn us into working-hard zombies.
the main characters are all performed with warmth and a playfulness that keeps the human side of the story engaging, while the plot develops with continual twists and tension.
The characters are all wholly lovable, the moral is completely resonant and, while the pace occasionally drags, it's pitch is just perfect (it's crowd-pleasing but never quite panders).
The movie starts out in good speed but slows down after a while.
So while I think the outcome of the movie was what I consider to be not realistic, I still liked the ending, the way I have enjoyed many endings to films that I consider to be fiction.
This film could so easily have been nauseating, but the superb acting made up for the rather predictable character played by Michelle Pfeiffer, while the child was perfectly cast.
Like Tom Cruise in "Rain Man", she goes through all the changes while the main character (Sean Penn here in another awesome display) has to remain relatively static throughout the proceedings.
She does her best with the part, but ultimately the clunking story & dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck.
The main problem with this film, therefore, is simply that there isn't enough of it; and while the plot and characters that we get introduced to are good, they could have been a whole lot better if the film had more of a budget to play with.
I first saw "The Green Pastures" quite by accident as a 13 year-old while visiting grandparents in Detroit, Michigan many, many years ago...I never forgot it.
Years later, in college, while on a date, I was telling my date about it and we stopped by the school library so I could find a copy of the play to show her...she loved it, too.
SjÃ¶strÃ¶m himself played this part in the stage version of this material and repeated it in the movie, while the role of the widow Halla was taken by his real-life spouse, Edith Erastoff.
Throughout Sjostrom shifts impressively between registers - nature as both real presence and symbolic backdrop; plot as both social depiction and spiritual journey - while retaining familiar action pleasures.
I have watched my share of Looney Toons shows even though I was born in 1993, and I know enough to know, that these feminine characters only appear once in a great while on the Looney Toons.
"Elm Street Two" is one of the shortest films I have seen in a while.
Very little nudity and when there is some backside scenes it is in a very traumatic situation : the gay sports teacher who is tortured and whipped in the nude of course, tied up to the showers, while the boy in the nude too is shown slightly in some darkness and flittingly.
Robert Englund makes a welcomed return as Freddy, while the rest of the cast does decent performances.
She plays the simple wife who can cook and 'once a while'.
At least that is what you would think while you are watching the movie but then the acting is super.
He would begin with something and start to draw lines which don't make any sense and yet as they say "patience bears fruits", while you wait patiently, there emerges the unexpected master piece which you could not even imagine.
And that is what exactly happened to me while watching the movie.
All the while Kirk has to be the one to decide on the basic question regarding the impending Japanese squadrons, and the viewer knows that at some point the ship probably will return to present (at filming) time.
It's kind of cool for a while, as you watch planes swoosh and dive, and it reminds you of the days when the prospect of going into the military meant you were going to fly cool planes and do cool things instead of simply being sent to a desert to be killed.
What was spectacularly done was the work they managed to get while filming on the actual U.S.S Nimitz.
If one does anything to alter the past while there, what will be the effects on the future you knew?
The only thing about the acting that I do distinctly remember is Joanna Cassidy screaming in realtime on the soundtrack while screaming in slow motion on the screen; I remember the scream sounding ridiculous, as if the dubbing director was giving her a wedgie.
Meanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.
The cast probably relished taking over the carrier for a while and the real captain, never shown, surely wished that the Navy hadn't banned hard spirits from our ships in World War I.
He told me that the F-14 almost crashed in that scene, stalling while trying to fly too slow, diving for the ocean to pick up speed, and barely recovering just above the wave tops.
Rhames and Howard are excellent in their lead roles while Chazz Palminteri and Jim Brown are solid support.
The thing is: Brown's character makes Animal realize that while he's the way he is as a result of the Black Experience in America, he doesn't have to stay that way.
James Allen (Animal) goes to prison for armed robbery for almost a decade while leaving behind a legacy as a cold-blooded killer.
Back at home he now must struggle with carving a out a new life while trying to figure out out how to save his son from ending up like him, or worse.
The movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil, inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin, and that concept failed miserably in Nikita due to the poor writing of the title role.
However, the actor playing Nick was convincing me that this guy was a really bad actor, while when he was not in auditions was what I consider a GREAT performance.
I loved it, while so many others hated it.
Eventually, she invites her brother, Bjarke, to live with them for a while, too.
the dogma 95 manifesto has produced several films (not all approved) and while i don't entirely "get" the reason for a manifesto i applaud the 3 legit films i have seen.
I stumbled across this little...... GEM lets call it, since that sounds classier than TURD, while i was looking up cheerleader porn....
I don't know about you, but I've seen enough peroxide blond brats, silly-cone tits and collagen lips for a while.
The latter is the case with virtually every movie nowadays; and that's OK; because it's natural(or "nature"); but it's not that important(in my view) because the latter(l&d) is a local perception while the former(L&D)- is a global one.
It takes you a while work out what is going on.
It is better than Easy Rider because it is not encumbered by all the hippie platitudes that really didn't age well and because Easy Rider is constantly telling you what it is about while Two Lane Blacktop shows you rather than telling you.
I enjoy this movie - it's funny but while the acting is really stiff - very little really comes across as other than line-reading- in everything else the movie rings pretty true.
Little physical gestures like the way that Taylor's Driver stops to hear love-making in a motel room, stands by the door a moment partially frozen, and then sits with knees folded to the chest for what would appear to be quite a while.
But there's a reason Easy Rider still defines the time period, while Two Lane has become grist for a "What Does It Mean" study group.
Hellman shoots for style while keeping his screen compositions simple.
Mechanic tells Driver to pull over and stop because it will take him a while to explain.
In modern life in general, I think people talk too much - try sitting still and shutting up for 103 minutes while watching this movie.
They look ahead to a blank future, while ignoring the life around them, what is in the present moment.
Run out and buy while it lasts.
Harvey's comments, while silly at times, at least have some measure of thought and truth behind them.
Gallagher's character says that while he experiences this "fantasy", he is happy, happier than he is in the real world.
Overall, it's a well-balanced movie that delivers a surprise that's not expected by the bland title alone, and while not an awesome movie of the highest caliber, it is certainly a movie that deserves a viewing.
When I discovered that David E. Kelley wrote the script for Gillian, it's flaws seem to have made a bit more sense for while I've rarely been privy to such notable TV shows like The Practice, Boston Legal, and Chicago Hope, it became clear that writing dramas that don't pertain to law or medicine isn't his forte and the result is a film in which no elements really work.
Paul (Bruce Altman), Esther's husband, is aware of his wife's intentions and quietly tolerates his them despite objections while simultaneously voicing his sexual frustrations in the presence of young beautiful women such as Cindy (Laurie Fortier), Rachel's friend, who's equally frustrated and so bored that she uses her sex appeal to taunt men for fun.
Gracie had some tough choices to make in this movie, playing mom to 3 brothers and a sister are choices that any teenager should not have to make, once in a while you'd care for siblings under the supervision of your parents, you'd simply carry out the instructions.
I'm not usually one for daytime movies or the type to watch the Hallmark Channel (in the UK) but while channel hopping, I saw a trailer for this movie.
Gracie's mother (Anne Heche) seems to be on the fast track to self-destruction, while Gracie's well-meaning grandma (Diane Ladd) is too old and frail to provide a stable home.
Once in a great while, Hollywood will actually make a movie for the sole purpose of entertainment, and this film is one of them.
This movie is imaginative, but the implication that all cats are evil while all dogs are good does a disservice to cats.
I've been a fan of Kirsten for quite a while.
I've been a fan of Kirsten for quite a while.
Don Juan is sent back to Spain because of his numerous romantic escapades and becomes involved in training the royal army in sword fighting, while also catching the eye of Queen Margaret.
Don Juan, wisely, persuades the Queen that her duties lies with her people, and after kissing her, he says: "I shall be the only one who knew that for a little while there was no Queen."
And although it was said at the time that he was slowing down and that he hit the booze while filming there is no evidence of it on screen.
Here the theme is heard in full bloom as the lovers say farewell to each other forever ("I shall be the only one who knew, for just a little while, that there was no Queen").
And this is even more the case in one-reel comedies than in two-reelers: the single-reel works of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Stan Laurel, and Charley Chase feature crazy, crude stuff they didn't dare put in their later, longer movies, things that often appear to have been improvised while the cameras were rolling.
Go watch paint dry while pondering your navel.
******SPOILER ALERT********   So, the kid not only tags along by hiding in the back of the vehicle while his father (Dolph) literally goes into a war zone to sweep for mines, but he runs across a well-marked minefield trying to get away from some soldiers...with predictable results.
The worst part is that he has this incredibly goofy grin on his face while he's running across the minefield.
I'm tired of these Hollywood elites lecturing us on the ills of industry and capitalism, while constantly reaping the benefits of it.
Once again, Ron Perlman is cast as a loud ignorant right winger, his vaguely simian cranial features a big asset to the role I'm sure, while "Good guy", James Legros is as bland as usual, with a nastier than usual beard.
There are those who believe it's needless paranoia with no solid scientific data to back it up, while others believe there's either enough evidence on hand to be concerned and ultimately we're better off being safe than sorry.
It plays to the most obnoxiously self-congratulatory nature of people concerned with the issues presented here, while at the same time offering nothing of any real substance.
Assuming you've managed to stay awake past the first 45 minutes we have some of the characters going slowly mad while ghostly sheep or something run around on the edge of their vision and random shots of environmental disasters are scattered across the screen.
Then it all goes completely to pot while crappy CGI see-through DragonMoose (tm) starts walking about and slapping people.
Princess Esmeralda discovers an evil afoot while Don Juan comes through as the ever valiant swordsmaster with a quick wit and even faster sword.
Dimple K. completely inhabited the character of Reva, while Vinod Khanna created an image of benevolent intelligence.
Beautiful Madeleine Carroll of "The 39-Steps" co-stars as the love interest Princess Flavia, while Raymond Massey scowls arrogantly behind his monocle as the chief villain.
The first two-thirds of "The Prisoner of Zenda" establishes the setting, situation, and characters, while the last third of this lavish costumer delivers thrills and chills, especially a swordfight between Colman and Fairbanks.
Later, while he is fishing on a game preserve, two of King Rudolph's men accost him and comment about his amazing resemblance to Lord Rudolph V. Indeed, Rudolf turns out to be the sovereign's distant cousin.
Rudolph's civility and sobriety surprises Flavia, while Rudolf is quite captivated by her beauty.
And there's another guy in there, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who's got his own agenda working while aligned with Massey.
Massey looks ill-at-ease as the king's evil brother while Fairbanks seems to be having a ball playing Massey's rascally henchman.
Sometimes Jews killed Jews while Poles, risking their lives, helped Jews.
But sometimes Poles killed Jews while German officers helped Jews.
She was so attractive, it is said, Alfred Hitchcock never got over his crush on her while make THE 39 STEPS and forever cast blonds who looked like her as his female leads for the rest of his career.
Douglas and Colman spare with words while mixing with swords in a carefully choreographed fight scene that shows they trained with an Olympic gold winning fencing master!
The performances outshine those of the shot-for-shot 1952 colour remake, while the Peter Sellers spoof deserves to be forgotten...
High points include an astonishingly beautiful Royal Ball, where Colman and Carroll reveal their love; a very funny yet menacing meeting between Colman and Fairbanks, as they discuss the real King's potential fate; and best of all, a MAGNIFICENT climactic swordfight between the pair, as they lunge and parry furiously through the halls of a castle, while exchanging quips and one-liners.
Her consistently dark raiment and shadowy movements are perhaps reflective of her lover's illegitimate origins, while at the same time belying her kind heart.
I'm supposed to be sympathising, but instead I find them petty and senseless, and all I notice is her perfectly parted hair while she's packing.
So here goes:   Salma is one of my favorite actresses, she has great talent, while Russell Crowe is my least favorite actor next to Tom Cruise.
Maybe if Crowe`s character beat up a few people while all Salma`s scenes revolved lying on top of that body builder in the gym it would have been more watchable ?
Men are often seeking independence and individuality while women are often looking for reassurance of love.
Imagine being told an old family story by your favorite Uncle or Grandfather while sitting around a living room late at night, with only the low light provided by the glow of a fire or one old lamp so nothing distracts your imagination's journey.
It opens up in a tough-looking laundromat or factory of some sort, and many of the key scenes are set with the main characters talking while they are busy with the work of their daily lives.
The political part it's very short indeed while a lot of space is given to the artist's new belief: the Kaballah.
Obayashi tries every cinematic technique in the book and while his special effects are indeed dated, they provide the audience with a jaw-dropping bombardment of weird images and set-pieces.
If Dario Argento, Richard Lester, Vera Chytilova, Seijun Suzuki, and Takashi Miike, conspired secretly made to re-make Star-Wars, and privately screened it for you, while you were hung upside down over a tank of piranha's, it would be about half as remarkable as this movie.
Now, this was described as "if Dario Argento directed Beetlejuice" but while that's appropriate in some ways it doesn't quite say enough.
Young Oshare, the niece of the woman who owns the house, may or may not be changing in ways that she & her friends would prefer not to happen, while the other girls are merely falling victim to the evils of the house.
Every once and a while this little gem shows up on late night TV and it's still fun to watch.
It's more or less an extended version of "Smokey and the Bandit:" hot shot speed demons trying to stay one step ahead of the law and dish out one-liners while shamelessly advertising Budweiser along the way.
So just sit back with the popcorn and shut off your brain for a while...it's a therapeutic necessity.
So while the race has started, and JJ realizes that that they don't have a patient for in back of the ambulance.
Now here is the original, we are all on strike (The actors) and this is where we are gonna hang out and party while being in this movie!
Bottom Line: Buy this flick, drag it out every once in a while, and have fun watching it with family or friends.
Passing references to "the war," "refugee zones" and the "American Empire," while "all natural" and "puppet" take on entirely different (and frightening) meanings.
Everything in GitS SAC is exceptional to say the least, the animation is crisp, fluid and has some amazing CG Effects while the Sound Effects as well as the voice acting is top notch.
however if you care for Plausibilty and Realism while watching and, want your Anime to be serious, then Your humble Quest has ended.
The robots (a different model called Fuchikoma in the manga) are, in my opinion, a nice counterpoint to the main plot: while Section 9 defends the people of Japan from manipulation of their "ghosts," they don't know quite what to make of these increasingly sentient robots.
It moved with a mellow pace while adding unexpected, humorous and dramatic twists to the plot.
while at the same time, Mick gets his lesbian ex-girlfriend pregnant.
The action, as it were, moves forward less on plot than on slice-of-life vignettes while our heroine -- who had a history of poorly-chosen paramours, of men who didn't appreciate her, leaving break-up messages on her phone machine during the opening credits -- copes with the ups and downs of dealing with two who finally do.
Unbelievably silly, cheap, boring softerotic variation of the old INDECENT PROPOSAL-plot with the Robert Redford-character, played by quite attractive, but not really stimulating Tane McClure, offering the Demi-Moore-character, here played by untalented, but happy-to-be-here bloke Tim Abell, money, if she, er, he helps her out in her bed, while his wife Gabriella Hall wanders around in the casino.
1970 was a good year for children's sci-fi; Jon Pertwee donned frilly shirt and cloak to become the third 'Dr.Who', while over on the other channel Michael Mackenzie battled evil as the enigmatic magician 'Tarot' in 'Ace Of Wands'.
Memorable moments include Simon and Liz's first encounter with the time barrier ( which makes an eerie buzzing sound ), the naval base overrun by Nazis out to steal a top secret laser, Liz finding her dead father preserved in ice, Dr.Edith Joynton ( Peggy-Thorpe-Bates ) aging to death in mere minutes, the room where people are held in suspended animation while dressed in Elisabethan clothes, the aged Traynor emerging from a secret room to sabotage The Master Plan, and the sight of planets in the night sky ( later copied by the 'Dr.Who' episode 'The Stolen Earth' ).
Burfield and Banks gave charming performances, while the late Denis Quilley exuded menace as 'Traynor'.
Tim Tyler as the police sergeant spits ping pong balls while singing "When the foeman bares his steel", a performance that perhaps would be more fitting in a shady Bangkok nightclub.
If you do, just swim to shore a while... and I'm sure, soon enough, you'll want to see it again... and again... and again... LIFEGUARD!
The wife of Daniel Petrie supposedly saw "Frogs" while her husband was trying to cast the lead role in his new movie, "Lifeguard," and she suggested he consider a minor actor with a suntanned physique named Sam Elliott.
There are over worked cheap shots where Rochester is played with by a seal but its done in a way that while demeaning are almost funny.
This third and final of the movie series while darker than the other Topper movies was in many ways the best in that it was killer funny while being enough of a mystery to keep you interested and focued on the murder plot.
The response again while slightly demeaning is hallarious.
This is a great movie that was filmed during the summer of 1941 while my family was camping in Big Bear, California.
Roland Young probably could have gone on making more Topper films, but I'm willing to bet he decided to quit while ahead.
Finally, an excellent movie utilizing the dark and brooding past and secrets of India, while blending them perfectly with the modern era...A Die-Hard Royal Guard who is willing to lay his life for his Rana...A Royal Heir with a guarded past...A powerless Rana who has turned murderous...An uncle with greedy motives...A cop with umpteen respect for the old royal guard, yet lots of anguish against the palace...all this sums up to a great story by a master story-teller, well defined characters, some well executed action shots, and great performances, and you have a modern-day masterpiece...A must watch...Glad to know Indian Film Industry can still churn out great cinema...If anyone is criticising this film, just avoid them...and see this movie...you'll be glad...India has made a mark in the International scene this time...
Now this film promos shouted classic from the top of the roof but sadly the film comes only half   The film starts off well, Sharmila's death scene is well handled and the drama thickens The film keeps you involved but sadly we expected much more The pigeons part was not well integrated in the plot and also the second half gets predictable and we know the actual killer  Even the Saif-Vidya romance track and the climax is half baked  Direction by VVC is excellent in parts only Camera-work deserves 5/5  Amongst actors Bachchan proves yet again he is an institution His body lang, dialogue delivery, expressions all are flawless even if he is just standing behind some lead actors he makes a maximum impact One of his best works Saif too does a great job,showing his growth as an actor Sanju is full of fun in his role and is brilliant in serious scenes His look and role is similar to THANEDAAR but he does a great job Vidya is mechanical Boman Irani excels in his part, Jimmy too excels in a negative role while Jackie is perfect
Jackie Shroff makes a comeback to commercial cinema after quite a while.
while you are watching " Eklavya" , you feel no matter how many other movie this actors have done for v.v.c.
Vishal's approach is earthy and raw, while Vidhu Vinod Chopra goes for more polish and bigger scale.
Boman Irani, an actor of sweeping range and intelligence, is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe-eyed ambiguity, while Jackie Shroff and Jimmy Sher Gill, as the wicked uncle and cousin, handle the villainy with lip-smacking gusto.
People making jokes or wise-cracking while they're being stalked by an unseen terror has always been a mood-killer for me.
The basis of the story follows Helen's bid for sanity, and while this provides an interesting backbone for the film - I really do think it could have been a lot better.
Soon, Helen's life goes into a downward spiral as she is accused of murder, while the Candyman tries to make her one of his new victims.
Later Candyman kills her friend Bernadette, and Helen is accused of first degree murder and arrested, while she unsuccessfully tries to prove that Candyman is the real killer.
A mysterious figure that can be summoned by repeating his name five times while looking in the mirror.
This is a thinking man's horror film that scares the daylights out of you at times while still leading you to think beyond what's on the screen.
Rose expertly weaves in Hitchcockian themes of being wrongly accused, emotional vulnerability, and psychological exploitation, while maintaining interest and building a high level of tension throughout the film.
No dear, you won't find happy teens in pastel t-shirts having slumber parties and discussing trendy scary movies, while some rap star tries to sell records on the soundtrack.
That was 1971...   Three decades later, while it's definitely dated, it's still an entertaining movie to watch.
But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery (!)
The fight-sequences in the movie are interesting, but after a while it does tend to be a bit tedious to watch, and at times fast-forwarding is probably a good idea to keep interest.
I watched it with the sound off while on the Internet and for like 20 min it was the same scene over and over; just some guy in a bloody cell and finally he begins to gnaw on himself to discover there's an amulet in his arm.
That was 75% of the audience changing the channel) of him killing a guy while a prostitute gets splattered with his blood.
Black fancies himself a superhero crime-fighter, while White, who is given to extrasensory knowledge and visions, dreams of one day moving away from the city and getting a home of their own on the beach.
The film mainly consists of the four of them discussing relationships with each other - and I'm talking about ninety percent conversation here, so be warned - while occasionally interrupted with people looking emotional.
After channel surfing for a while - and an elbow from the wife who took charge of the remote control - we settled on this film, DINNER WITH FRIENDS.
The couples are really opposite to each other: the one that dissolves becomes happy while the one that rejoices becomes sad.
Particularly the realization that when a marriage evolves into one dealing with day-to-day responsibilities of bringing up children and the daily business of our lives, the marriage seems to suffer.... but, the difference between the two couples is that one decides to stay together and cope with the realities of life, while the other couple looks elsewhere to recapture the adventurous feelings of new love with a new partner.
TV may be mostly a wasteland these days, but every once in a while, a fine original film shows up on the tube.
If you enjoyed "Hitch," you will most certainly find "Waltzing Anna" well worth your while.
The minotaur, while always hinted at, DID sort of come out of nowhere at the end.
Shes close to be a soldier who fights for integrity and for the human freedom while she claime up the stairs to respect and acknowledgement.
Irene seeks to bring Jolyon back into the family and to reunite him with June, who is about to be married to an architect, Philip Bosinney (Young) - while she herself is falling for Philip, and he with her.
In fact, the inference is that while she loves Philip in her heart, nothing except a few kisses has actually happened.
Here he has a Frenchish accent while in the Stout books Fritz, as befits his name, is Central European, as I recall, with a Germanic accent.
On the down side the film takes a while to get going.
There is a great deal of violence within the film (which while in my eyes completely justifies the progression of the film is incredibly misleading when you look at the UK Film Certificate Branding of a mere 12) as the battles waged become more intense, more bloody and more important to the survival of our two heroes.
As expected for being orphaned children, each have their issues, and with Black it is the impression that he is only one bad day away from total insanity and mental breakdown, while with "White" the issue is if he were to have a mental breakdown it wouldn't have much to break.
And that while Bickerstaff is such a nice guy in the novel.
Watching it a second time, readers will realise that while most of the action in India is true to the book, it picks events almost at random from Sharpe's Tiger, Sharpe's Triumph and Sharpe's Fortress (the three books set in India), while simultaneously moving them from the period of 1799-1803 to 1817.
Black is the older more responsible brother, who is tough and violent, while White is the younger, off beat, childish brother.
Well, she did sing in other films, most notably in "Bye Bye Birdie", and "My Sister Eileen", and while she was not known as an accomplished singer or dancer, she managed to give fairly good performances in both films and to demonstrate a competent ability in numerous guest appearances on variety television programs of the '50's and the '60's.
His daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning) becomes very connected with Sonya, and while the horse is rehabilitated, the wounds in the ties of the Crane family are also healed.
I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning for a while now, and I think she does well in almost everything she does, but I don't think it would be possible for her to do any better than she did in this movie.
Cade Redman tools around in a loud red Trans Am, while Cannonball's nemesis barrels along in a big, black Plymouth, trying to outsmart Cannonball at every turn and exit ramp.
The difference, though, is that while Cannonball is often funny with some great action, Cannonball Run is often too over-the-top and unwatchable.
I hadn't realized how truly warped and twisted the mind of Andy Dick was until he had his own series (for at least a while).
But the excitement factor was better when Steve landed on the car giving Jamie a chance to escape, while Steve flipped the car, and the car took off after being flipped.
Their routine as they try to get some sleep while a battle rages around them is definitely more along the lines of black comedy than what is usual for the Stooges.
A little while later, the Stooges are dirty and ragged, and standing at a window begging for food at a restaurant.
For a while, the unusual plot threatens to develop into something really interesting.
It is actually a very enjoyable large-scale action film which, while perhaps lacking the touch of greatness, deserves to be re-evaluated more positively.
She gives us a good view of her hootage as she changes a shirt while waiting with Bronson.
Charles Bronson fans will like his performance as Link, a thief who's forced to team up with Toshiro Mifune's character Kuroda-a Samurai who has 7 days to get back a sword stolen while traveling to the US capital in 1870(around that time); the sword was to be a gift to the prez.
Also there just is something surreal about watching Tim Thomerson fight a giant baby doll while rescuing his beloved "dollchick".
And at just over an hour in length where the best scene has an evil foul-mouthed Baby Doll tries to have sex with the foot tall Ginger while he makes Dollman watch, it just really makes you wonder what the point to this whole mess of nonsesne even was.
When driving in the bus, he is stared at by all the children, while the adults look away.
When he meets an old acquaintance, they go on a joined drinking binch and rehash old memories while patrolling the foggy streets.
Now while the plot really is quite unlike the show (in which Steve is NOT the next James Bond, but he is still pretty cool in the show), the basic idea and structure is there.
The cartoon like violence is another negative, with villains firing automatic weapons that consistently miss our heroes at close range, while our heroes guns seem to have an endless supply of bullets.
On the other hand, what gets me really going is the bad guys, Wong Lik portraying a very successful archvillain while Chan Shu-kei appears in the underrated role of a small "death on two legs".
Some think it achieves its goals while many just enjoy the film's high gore factor.
While this "bard" might not be serving this same purpose, the songs he sings are quite chilling and the visuals, such as the girls marching while wearing gasmasks, are quite stunning.
After a while, it goes to a samurai (IZO) getting speared to death while being crucified.
This is one of my favorite Takashi Miike films, while it might not be for everyone it is a must see for fans of the auteur, and those who think film can be aesthetic object as opposed to just a linear story.
To say it's been a while since I've seen a movie that was actually as intelligent as it thinks it is an understatement.
So this time-traveling samurai dude kills a ton of people, and along the way this other dude sings nonsensical things for ten minutes at a time while sounding like he's just eaten a cat who was itself gargling nails.
Izo is humanity's anger, righteous and frustrated; resolute and indignant, leading us towards utopia while cutting a swath through the sadly ignorant masses that would oppose him.
Years later, the unfaithful JosÃ© (Juan Antonio JimÃ©nez) marries Candela (Cristina Hoyos) but while defending his lover LucÃ­a (Laura del Sol) in a brawl, he is stabbed to death.
Carmelo (Antonio Gades), who secretly loves Candela since he was a boy, is arrested while helping JosÃ© and unfairly sent to prison.
More characters talking while riding in a car.
Characters talk while they eat.
There's a lot of eye candy in the picture and it's easily one of the prettiest dramas I've seen in a while.
That said, while I found the characters fairly interesting, the show suffers a little from developing the characters too slowly, often threatening the characters becoming flat.
The lovers Francesca (Doris Dowling) and Walter (Vittorio Gassman) has just robbed a valuable jewel from a hotel, and Francesca joins a group of workers while escaping from the police.
She is extremely beautiful and sexy in the role of the peasant Silvana, especially while dancing with the handsome Vittorio Gassman.
The main reason for its success probably lied in the fact that the audience could enjoy a Noir story of doomed love, betrayal and crime while being politically instructed, watching the miserly, semi-literate female workers develop Marxist consciousness while parading their butts and naked thighs in industrial quantities.
All of this while exuding sex through every pore.
Too much of the running time is compromised of talk, and while these bits of campy dialog are entertaining in similar films, the lack of shocking elements to space them out makes them quite monotonous after a while.
Then, one night, the only freak in the movie--a little person named, appropriately, "Shorty"--sees Jade getting it on with Blackie, and while he says nothing, he makes his dislike of Jade as clear as this script is capable of making it.
Not your usual movie fare, "Vengo" divides its time equally between musical ethnic folk singing and dancing from gala festivities to impromptu "jam" sessions to funeral laments while inching the family feud story slowly forward with the kinetic tempos of flamenco rhythms everpresent.
But I found it sugar-coated while avoiding some deeper issues - like what is the traditional spirituality of these people that the Mormon missionary was replacing.
And it wasn't overdone like the droning love story in "Pearl Harbour" where the man had too decided to leave his woman for a while.
The movie contains what seems to be an honest look at a missionary leaving his home for quite a while, not knowing what to expect, and, returning home unexpectedly different.
It was full of beautiful messages that we as a human race have so sadly forgotten If once in a while we all took a moment and thought of life like the young man in this movie, this would be a wondrous world.
The difference between these two films is that one pits a single man against the world and against himself, while the other pits a young man against an utterly alien life which he manages to blend into his own.
The "slowness" of the Pacific island life is micro-viewed to reveal that there are actually exciting and humorous details of daily life; while macro-viewed to show the occasional punctuation of extreme chaos and challenge,change and redirection.
When rich chick Alicia fakes her own kidnapping by locking herself in the trunk of her car in order to get attention from her elusive father (Jack Thompson), a car thief (Benicio Del Toro) steals it while followed by two lowly hoodlums and Alicia's anemic uncle (Chris Walken) who wants to bring her back to Daddykins.
The crying and grieving took place for 1 full day (24 hours - day and night) while different groups of people from all the villages on the island, came to pay their last respects.
Instead we are given a chance to journey beyond the obvious "sound bites" and start to understand just a little of what those interviewed went through and who they are (while avoiding the maudlin Barbara Walters approach, which can so easily rob the subject of his/her dignity).
While most of the interview subjects are male, lesbians are represented by Annette Eick, a remarkably charming woman, and while their stories vary considerably in detail they are the same in content: I was there, I saw it, and I bear witness for those who cannot speak.
Rob Epstein conveys all of these truths with anger and emotion, throughout while interviewing these survivors.
They may just bury the memories, but they shouldn't regret --- judging from their facial expression while they were recalling their love at first sights and my imagination of a certain hilarious party in a certain club on a certain street in the night of the 1920's Berlin of chaos and liberation.
Some scenes are OK, such as the scenes set inside a cave, where two of the central characters are held captive, being urinated on while trapped in a cage and being forced on to all fours and ridden around like a horse, but in the main it is badly acted and pretty boring.
One group is captured by an unknown tribe while the others try to find them and stay alive.
Robert fights them off single-handedly with lame kung-foo while the other two high-tale it out of there.
All of this helps add to the bland movie atmosphere, and it's not helped by the Flintstones-like music playing all the while.
Maybe it was just the fact that I watched this movie on television with commercial breaks while doing homework, and therefore wasn't exactly giving it my full attention and deep scrutiny, but I rather liked it.
From Bloomingdales to the bottom of the sea, this movie constantly finds ways to make you burst out laughing, while also making you burst out in tears!
So while this film is not a classic per se, it is a fine document of 80's comedy.
He doesn't know she is a mermaid so basically the rest of the movie is about her trying to conceal the fact that she is not human,while they are in the meantime falling in love.
The fact that you had this nutty guy going around trying to prove she was a mermaid, yet looking completely stupid and insane while doing so.. Oh man he was so funny.
while the show certainly has a dated feel (it does have an annoying laugh track), the jokes were often clever and Joan Davis was brilliant.
well, having not seen this show in a while (i don't believe this show was ever on nick at nite.
I mean, what kind of a movie has a woman go into labor while gyrating in a Santa Claus suit then show her give birth to a one-armed baby, get abandoned by her married lover, watch as her stepmother breast-feeds the one-armed baby, abandons said baby, finds her long-lost mother (who it turns out is a schizophrenic), learns that one-armed baby is in a coma... all in about 15 minutes.
She wants more out of life than her working class plumber boyfriend (and father of her child) can offer her so she falls in love with a lawyer from Ireland while pregnant(someone as far removed from her Brooklyn world as possible!)
In 'Porky's Romance', Petunia is cruel, selfish, idle and greedy and, while this may not have been beneficial for the character's longevity, it is extremely beneficial for the cartoon.
In no time, heartbroken Porky is out the door while the sadistic girl he loves laughs at him.
The plot:  In Paris (Australia),a man who had a while a go,accidentally run-down an old man,car breaks down in a small town.While there,the memories of his brother (who has died in a crash)come back.The man finds out,while staying in a local hospital that the towns people use the crashed cars in a strange ways... View on the film:  While there are some interesting set-pieces (the derby-style crash,the psychiatrist identifying items scene).The rest of the film feels painfully slow,with the third-act feeling a bit rushed.Weir does a very good job with some of the small set-pieces,but makes the rest of the film to slow.
A society which burdens it's youth with strict rules and regulations, while forcing them to take menial 9 to 5 jobs, or go to war in a far away land.
Note the Mayor's hypocrisy in his attitude towards the Bruce Spence character for causing an accident, while patting Arthur on the back for ramming one of the hoons (anti-war protesters?)
One of the more enjoyable 'fun' films I've seen in a while, Excess Baggage left me with a smile on my face.
One top film critic at the time commented that 'Picnic' with all its ethereal mystery was Weir's take on sci-fi movies, while 'Cars' was an allegory of the vampire movie.
For some reason Weir draws a clear line between the town's youth and the town's older folk; the youth is out of control and relishes the violence, while the older citizens are calm, collected, and regard the whole thing as merely business.
John McLean's grainy, luridly grungy cinematography allows the Australian outback to take on a scary, nightmarishly surreal aura while Bruce Smeaton's sometimes dissonant, more often strangely jaunty rock-tinged score adds substantially to the pervasively unnerving nuttiness.
That was maybe one of the reasons that the people of Serbia hardly knew what was going around their country and what their government had been up to, while the queues for buying bread were miles long... as it's shown in the movie.
This shows while it then had an American version, but it's not worth it.
Revolting politicians and their greed are to blame, not only the desperate young men who lose their reasoning while trying to be someone.
The reason I came today to comment it is that while reviewing the comments about another film I saw yesterday, I find that that that one was among the 50 best films in IMDB.
Earlier today while browsing through the movie channels I caught the beginning of it.
Their desire to expose the twins (for shock value/gossip as in Sissy's case, or money and publicity in Tre's case), come off as writer's constructs, and while the actions are genuine, the situations feel contrived (but the performances are good and very effective, especially Ant as Tre).
Twin Falls Idaho is an art house film that insults the intelligence of its viewers while boring them all at the same time.
People taking pictures while they sit in the park, them being approached and the attempt made to make them into freak show superstars.
Perhaps only twins like the Polish brothers could have made the quintessential work of art about conjoined twins--one that shows the uniqueness and depth of this bond, while universally hinting at how deeply love is rooted in our very flesh.
The acting is superb; the Polish brothers are completely believable as the conjoined twins Blake and Francis Falls, performing feats like deftly buttoning up each other's shirts or playing the guitar together (Blake strums while Francis manages the fret for chord changes) as if they had, indeed, done it all their lives.
I kept holding my breath while watching this movie.
Go see for yourself - it's an experience that would worth your while.
but what this movie is about is basically a serial killer chases around scantly clad women who have the weird urge to take showers while they are running from the killer.
It carries its ludicrous premise with a conspicuous joie de vivre and at a boisterous pace, all while avoiding the doldrums of self-parody.
As a piece of cultural history, this semi-documentary is inadequate - there is no attempt to explain the subversiveness of these irreverent, flippant, violent, beautiful cartoons in the context of Disney-dominating ick-animation and gloomy, propaganda-laden World War Two - to which many of these cartoons tacitly refer, revealing complicated truths other 'real' films couldn't dare, such as the barbaric effect fighting barbarians can have on 'our' side; there is no analysis of the glorious pretention-pricking of both Hollywood and high culture, or Bugs' androgynous proteanism, or how the cartoons retained a level of fresh invention while seemingly locked in repetitive formulae; of the powerful psychoanalytic premisses of each short, in which a wild, elusive, lawless animal stands in for our stifled desires, especially as World War Two gives on to the post-war world of Joe McCarthy and chums.
There's also an interview with Friz Freleng, some footage of Mel Blanc, while Elmer, Sylvester, Tweety, and Foghorn also appear in the cartoons.
The boys thought I was just as funny because I would tell them about my childhood days while we watched.
It was not cheesy enough to laugh at, and it was so terrible I actually experienced physical pain while watching it.
Andrew's romance with Portia was also touching and believable though I did not think about this while the movie ran.
During his journey, he has to face the fact and live with it that all loved ones around him grow older and eventually die while he is immortal.
Her debut episode featured one of the most ridiculous scenes ever broadcast on television - Ms.Ladd stripping naked in the middle of a street so as to gain entry to an exclusive nudist camp, while an elderly security guard chortled with glee.
The movie lacks a good plot, and is rather boring after a while.
There's a reason this movie was forgotten, while Leone's films are still talked about.
Long story short, the two need to go on a journey to find the only man who who knows how to open an impenetrable safe full of gold back down in Mexico, the Prof. Xantos (Rey); but it's not a pleasure tour, as he is being held captive in an American garrison, and all the while the two are being hunted by a 'marijuana-crazed' Jack Palance.
Jack Palance is deliciously OTT as loathsome gangster, while Iris Berben (as Lola the cherubic freedom-fighter) and Karin Schubert (as ZaÃ¯ra the helpful prostitute) provide the film with some welcome eye-candy and even nudity.
Man, this is everything I want while watching a Spaghetti Western, great characters, a solid story, superb action sequences, and best of all a fantastic score that is the just the icing on the cake.
Trinita opted for a satirical approach while Sabata brought James Bond sensibilities to the classic anti-hero.
The lighthearted Morricone score fits this film very well and I like the musical cues that are sprinkled throughout that alternate between that familiar fuzz guitar and whistling banjo playing that happens while the action has quieted down.
There's also a fairly interesting 15 minute interview with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian and Ennio Morricone where they recount their experiences while they were involved in this film.
Get ready for a run-on... A Spaghetti Western set in the Mexican Revolution about a foreign mercenary played by Franco Nero who makes an uneasy alliance with a Mexican bandito who unwittingly becomes a revolutionary while simultaneously falling in love with a freedom-fighter chick who is really hot, all while being tracked by an eccentric villain played by Jack Palance...directed by Sergio Corbucci, with a score by Ennio Morricone and a few machine gun massacres and at least one scene where someone is buried up to his neck while horses are about to trample on his head.
The story is simple enough: the Drop Squad(Drop is an acronym for Deprogramming and Restoration Of Pride) is group that kidnap ignorant sellout blacks and force them to reconnect with their culture while getting them to realize what they're doing to their people is wrong.
As a proud White American I must say that this movie is a powerful structure that requires a tremendous amount of understanding for another culture while swallowing a little pride of my own.
Jean Delannoy stands as one of the best (if not simply the best)Simenon adapters.In the short space of two years he made two gems ,while the nouvelle vague was insulting him ,and these two gems should not be missed:"Maigret tend un piÃ¨ge" and "Maigret et l'affaire Saint-Fiacre" (1959),both absorbing,both featuring a top-notch cast,both packing a real wallop.The first one is an urban psychological thriller,the second one takes place in the country,in the castle of old aristocrats.
Despite his occasional appearance in the films of major directors like Max Ophuls, Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, from the 1950s onwards Jean Gabin seemed content to rely simply on his effortlessly charismatic screen persona and elevate an apparently interminable succession of old-fashioned potboilers which, while undeniably enjoyable in themselves, now seem like a regrettable waste of this monumental French film star.
Of course, the film benefits from a great interpretation : Jean Gabin gives life to his determined-shrewd-exhausted "commissaire" while Jean Desailly shines as the poor but dangerous Maurice whose boyhood has been prolonged by the misguided love of his mother ( Lucienne BogaÃ«rt, perfect ).
Unlike the other post here, I felt that the English translations, while at times good for colloquialisms, left a bit to be desired.
while this is not a masterpiece, as another reviewer mentioned, it is an interesting and realistic portrayal of true life sociopath Audrey Marie Hilley.
Kline cannot get a grip on his tortured Nathan, and for good reason: the character is a writer's contrivance (bombast conjured up out of mental illness), while MacNicol has some strong early scenes but eventually plays third-wheel (not an enviable position).
Streep makes her tremulous and lovely, nervous and chatty while also politely flustered, and there are moments when she's radiant.
Stingo was well-cast, but as usual Kevin Kline was annoying, loud, pretentious, while eating the scenery.
And while Streep is undoubtedly the star, both Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol deserve credit for making 'Sophie's Choice' work as well as it does.
And you cannot help but be drawn into such a real sense of both conflict & compassion, duty and despair...this film completely melted my face off while cementing an admiration and awe I rarely experience from an actor's performance.
They all become good friends, but while Nathan seems to go deeper and deeper into madness Sophie tells Stingo from time to time parts of her story, how she survived and what a terrible choice she had to make.
For example take the comic second scene of the film where Bill Cody has to wait for a letter, while the postman delivers the mail according to rank.
we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism.
Hence, Howard crumbles while Christine, well-grounded in her personality, apparently bounces back.
This is not a movie about sexism (while it is used quite often to hide the real truth), but instead the power of manipulation, the power of emotion, and the ability to use your friends to reach the top.
However, while Glengarry plays as more of a character-driven mystery and morality play, In the Company of Men is much more insidious, and it offers no solutions in the end.
Reb Beach (formerly of Winger) takes a back seat to Aldrich while capably handling the rhythm guitar duties here.
It doesn't matter that the director seems to have "written" this while shooting it, nor that the film runs out without any explicable ending.
Part of the reason people seem to think it is terrible may be because, whether intentionally or not, the film sets about mocking Reality Television (which is a major part of the film), so while you may watch the film and think that it is rubbish, perhaps that is what the creators want you to think.
The authentic location work helps cement a realistic edge, while the pacing is rather measured and rather low-scale in its escalating confrontations and violence (which is tamely staged, but gut wrenching since you're thrown right into the acts).
Cinematographer Richard Crudo obviously is a creative partner here of Corrente, and there is a great deal of originality within his compositions, while he is able to make something fresh with use of closeups.
Worth a look for bad movie lovers and those wanting a movie they can laugh at while debating the sanity of the film makers.
Lesley Anne Down is a good choice and while she was dubbed she still gives it her all.
The VHS tape, while probably not perfect, has the virtue of being unbroken.
Takuro receives an anonymous letter that states his wife is having an affair while he slips away to fish.
He's chewing gum and singing cowboy songs while they repo his vehicles.
Walker overdoes prissy (which I guess equaled Communist in that climate), and Heflin's underplaying, while not much fun to watch, is refreshing in contrast.
And, while there was a 'Red Scare' (with some terrible abuses of civil rights), there actually was a reason to be scared.
For a while, I liked her playing of this role.
It takes a while to get in gear, but once it does, it hits the viewer over the head with its anti-Communist message.
Helen Hayes does her usual over-acting - she may be a stage legend, but it doesn't translate well here - while Dean Jagger is simply embarrassing as the somewhat simple father.
Peter Palmer and Leslie Parrish are charming as Abner and Daisy Mae,while Howard St. John is a perfectly pompous General Bullmoose.
A while back, I heard some folks on TV referring to Yogi Bear as a "classic" cartoon and was absolutely shocked!
Powell goes willingly to jail while Mrs. Cheney finds her true love in Montgomery.
The original, while having some very funny moments was more of a tearjerker and a genuine one it was too.
Sometimes there is silence in the forest, and a character standing still while the light falls just so, to convey wonder or loneliness.
"Bambi II" will surely please most fans of the original, but while it's an honest attempt to make a respectful and original addition to the main storyline, it becomes a bit too clichÃ©d for moments.
The use of a couple of pop ballads may prove damaging on the long road, as while the songs are really good, they take away that atemporal characteristic the first film had and will definitely make the movie outdated a lot sooner than expected.
The difference is that in the original the artwork is more refined, while this one combines the fabulous artwork of the original with computer/digital techniques and technologies.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
So I got to see Bambi 2, while normally we have a million Disney sequels that are major disappointments, but Bambi 2 surprised me, it was very well done and was nicely put together.
It all seemed like mindless prattle after a while.
And while Bambi's character has always been humanized (as are all animals in Disney movies) he seems far more "human" and much less "animal" than he did in the original.
The Plot:  The wife of a doctor (who is trying to impress his bosses,so he can get promoted).Is trying to finish her written course,while hes at work.But one day a strange man,who says that hes a Plumber,tells her hes been called out to repair some pipes in there flat.As time goes on it turns into a battle to see,how much she can take of this "Plumber".
In the 70,s we were gathering a following in Adelaide playing pubs ,clubs and large venue,s and were approached to write a few songs for the film.After putting the songs together in a short time,we went into a recording studio and laid down 3 tracks Unfortunately the songs can only be heard on the plumbers radio while he,s working, and even then it,s you can barely hear it.
A married graduate student takes some time off to work on her thesis and play housewife to her doctor husband while living in a University apartment complex.
He responds simply by saying 'I think I'll just go on deck for a while'.
The fate of the Graf Spee at the conclusion of the movie is watched from the harbor walls by thousands, all the while an American broadcaster is giving to radio listeners a description of what is occurring.
Unfortunately, while this film was big on realism, it also will probably seem a tad dull to the average person because it did stress realism and not huge name actors and unnecessary action.
The cameras of the world's press focused on Montevideo as the German ship struggled to regain its fighting ability while the Royal Navy converged to attack when it was, inevitably, forced to leave.
And while it looks from the cover like another one of his straight to DVD action films, it's actually more of a messy, jumbled horror/comedy sort of film that goes to both extremes with each genre.
Don't know, because half of them are killed by accidents, while the Bog Man is killing innocent bystanders in the nearby town.
The show was a spin off from BJ and The Bear (about a Vietnam War soldier saved by a chimp while a POW ) he brings the chimp home to the US.
And while it wasn't Shakespeare, the writing was much better than the critics would have you believe.
But plot isn't the point of most of Hong's films, rather, they focus in on the characters and it's quite amusing watching these two artists try to be friends while at the same time trying to one up each other and get with the figurative or actual girl.
I suppose my primary issue with Woman is that, because of its rambling nature, it doesn't fully cohere in the end, especially with a coda that spins out of the original setup and while I'd be surprised with any sort of total closure in a Hong film, the strands thematically go a little far out, leaving the viewer is left grasping for more strongly tied together story.
Seon-hwa is the unconditional ever-loving person, Mun-ho is the man with deep love but not very sure of himself, while Hyeon-gon is the man who's love is cheap but somehow appreciated.
In the present, while he is married, he claims to have no love for his wife.
At their reunion, Mun-ho reveals his guilt over abandoning Seon-hwa, while she berates him for the pain he caused her.
It's been a while since I watched the amusingly titled "Woman is the Future of Man" at the Quad.
And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets, or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there.
Lamest of all is the film's dubious morality: no one blinks an eye when an otherwise likable Lugosi knifes a cat; and the ending sees Manners and Bishop enjoying one of those it's-all-over-now, ho-ho epilogues after they've accidentally shot Lugosi in the back and made a run for it while everyone else explodes.
The movie Office Space came to mind on more then on occasion while watching this.
Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up, as you do.
Based around a story by Edgar Allan Poe, The Black Cat sees a young couple, Peter & Joan Allison {David Manners & Julie Bishop}, who while on their honeymoon in Budapest meet the mysterious scientist Dr. Vitus Verdegast {Lugosi}.
I couldn't find that information here, but in case anybody else is wondering I found it on Wikipedia--"'I Will Wait For You' from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as sung by Connie Francis, which writer Eric Kaplan's parents played and sang on the piano while he was a child."
They are instructed to lay low for a while but Tom can't do that leading to tragic consequences.
A title card at the film's opening announces that the filmmakers in no way mean to glamorize the gangster life, while one placed at the end announces a call to action on the part of the American public to bring an end to the seedy underworld portrayed in the movie.
Of course the famous grapefruit scene has gone down in film annals as one of them, but I was most struck by the film's shocking finale, in which the body of Cagney is dropped off at the front door of his home while his mother happily changes the sheets of his bed upstairs, thinking that "coming home" means that her son is coming home alive.
After he enters the pool hall, we hear shots and a man screaming while the camera stays focused on the exterior of the building.
And, while there were so many more similar films after it, very, very few came close to it in style, impact and story.
This led to the famous scene in which Tom Powers first purchased, and then shot the horse that had fatally thrown Nathan while riding the Bridle Path in Lincoln Park.
Tom's brother, Mike Powers (Donald Cook) is the most visible and obvious counterbalance to the hoodlumism of his brother, Mike was a veteran of World War I and has worked his way through night school, while working on the street cars; Case Closed.
She also barely appreciates Mike's sacrifices (he goes to fight in World War I, and gets gassed, and while Tom's material wealth increases due to crime, Mike is only able to get a job as a streetcar conductor).
First, Tom's "purity" while in a relationship with Gwen (Jean Harlow).
Clever tricks abound - we see a grisly horror film being enjoyed by Hartwin reflected on his eyeball in an extreme close up, while in an earlier flashback the camera travels under the sheets to watch him reading under his bedclothes as a child.
There is the odd unexpected moment of black humor - yes, you feel guilty for chuckling - while the bare bones script is stripped of exposition and all the better for it.
It's not even fun writing a user-comment for it (while the sequel was).
This hardens the police investigation while the killer (on a motorcycle and carrying an authentic butcher knife) is still on the loose.
In the last analysis, it's fascinating to watch Universal's horror stars turning on each other with such unbridled ferocity and playing along with this campy joke while keeping a straight face at all times.
In any case, while both elements are effectively present â a hatchet-wielding murderer is the subject of the climactic manhunt â the police procedural themes are more prevalent.
As usual for Italian genre movies, the music score is an asset and here it is provided by Stelvio Cipriani whose motif, while simple and repetitive, is extremely effective given that it involves children singing gibberish (and thus commenting on the main theme of the movie itself even through its performers).
Marjorie Rambeau has a nice supporting role, as Crawford's mother; their pivotal "Gypsy Madonna" scene is very nicely played, with Crawford singing "Tenderly" (her real voice) in a "duet" with the woman who dubbed her material (India Adams), while mother Rambeau guzzles a beer.
The dialogue is laughable at times, but the actors manage to hold their faces straight while saying it and do a pretty good job with the rest of the film.
Shooting took place in 1967 while cruising between Los Angeles and Acapulco(Mexico)I earned US$ 80,- for my (very small)part.I since then followed the career of James Garner, especially the TV-series like the mini-series "Space"(Michener) and Space Cowboys (2000) and the series of Jim Rockford, the P.I.starting in the seventies.
I had not seen it on TV for a while, so I decided to buy the video.
In Tod Browning's "Dracula", Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi took the role of the immortal vampire while at the same time, English born Boris Karloff became the legendary man-made creature of James Whale's "Frankenstein".
However, while Karloff makes a terrific job as Poelzig, the highlight of the film is certainly Bela Lugosi, who in this movie proves that he was truly a remarkable actor and delivers what probably is the best performance of his career.
My problems with this include the fact I find it rather preposterous that Colossus would cease with its surveillance of Forbin while he's in bed with the mistress, given that Colossus is watching him in the bathroom and such.
"Blue Gene's performance, while it has been under construction, has quadrupled in just 12 months."
Hmm #3 "Purple can do 100 teraflops while it carries out simulations of nuclear weapons performance."
In hindsight, while it's much admired by connoisseurs of either genre (being a fan of both, I'd been longing to catch up with it for years!
I had a dim memory of a movie I saw while very young in the 1970s about a computer called Colossus that tries to take over the world.
Even while attempting to become the dictator of Earth, Colossus sometimes displays a sense of humor that is almost human, and a ruthlessness that is all too human.
In this film, it is the human spirit that is the casualty while the human biology lingers on.
Gordon Pinsent plays the concerned President, while Lenoid Rostoff plays his Russian counterpart.
The difference here is that while HAL malfunctions due to a programming conflict, Colossus and Guardian remain all too stable, convinced beyond a doubt that they know how to protect Mankind better than Man himself.
And, while Le Chaudron Infernal is STILL an amazing film, it pales in comparison to some of these other films.
The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest were probably related to how costly and laborious was the process of hand-coloring frame by frame, as while his first hand-colored movie was done in 1897 ("L'Hallucination De l'Alchimiste"), he wouldn't attempt to make another one until 1903, when the hand-colored movies done by Edison's Studios became to be as popular as his films.
Other example: when the "militiamen" appear,they have fun shooting, torturing and burn the zombies (when there are 3 zombies hunded in a tree and the humans are laughing while they shoot to them).
Her character has changed while the girlfriend of Tom behaves very much like Barbara of the original, even though in the original the girlfriend acts totally different.
I don't mind that, but it did the original some injustice by turning one of the leads into a dominant lead while in the original she was in shock throughout the movie and get's killed.
In most modern horror movies, the men and woman start as equal, probably the men being the dominant, but when tragedy strikes, the women take charge and survive while the men die.
Whether or not the Barbara character was altered out of fear of being attacked by feminist groups, I don't know, but I do know that too many horror movies these days are about though, dominant female leads who survive the tragedy that befalls them while the men succumb to the tragedy.
Seven strangers barricade themselves in an isolated farmhouse while cannibalistic zombies walk the countryside.
Pretty faithful remake (written by original NOTLD co-creator George A. Romero) of the zombie classic in which seven people are trapped inside a farmhouse while a plague of the flesh-eating undead beings roam rural Pennsylvania.
So OK.... THEN...  After Ben and Harry had their shootout, Harry locks himself in the attic while Ben, with the good common sense is the one that finds himself in the basement.
His perfect diction adds to the effectiveness of the lines; the word "horror" is emphasized, given a menacing intonation, while a pause, and a lift of the eyes upwards in a mock-religious expression, a slight hissing in the final sound, gives the ordinary phrase "of cats" a genuinely frightening connotation.
(And while this pic isn't The Lion in Winter, it's also hard to see how it's worse than Beckett.)
Hannah Arendt's 'Banality of Evil' trope is put to work, as all facts - even those of the Holocaust - become statistical fodder for the war machine that remade Europe, while only the personal murders that the Tanz character is hunted for disturb the placid hum of the post-war apparatus.
Those pics have a Noir-ish 'victim mentality' akin to Camus' The Stranger, while Generals has an activist mentality like The Plague, presented in a similar deadpan-existentialist style, in the face of futility.
The entire present day subplot, while sometimes dramatic, and a  way to see what happened to the major players, is completely  unnecessary.
O'Toole is at his very best when he is seen to be going mad while viewing a self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh when the artist was in an insane asylum.
Yet while abhorring (or supposedly abhorring) the Rippers, Christies, Mansons, etc.
We see him destroying a section of Warsaw (presumably the ghetto) while being questioned by Grau.
Hartmann is assigned to chauffeur Tanz around Paris while he is on vacation there.
Then there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war, but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among (some of) the officers to eliminate Hitler, a movement about which Major Grau (Omar Sharif), investigating the slaughter of a prostitute, observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning.
The murderer meets his just end (while sensibly drunk as a skunk in the novel) but the story is fundamentally a tragic one.
"French Cancan" is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage, etc., only one character, Casimir, ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation.
Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he has discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle.
The whole movie is about how Danglard's concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show--how the audience demands devotion--and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero, while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men.
If not, then why do the Turks seem like Military geniuses while the Russians look like morons?
I don't know - somehow Beroyev gives a bit wooden performance (IMHO)... Viktor Verzhibitskiy is great as Lucan, the Romanian colonel... Great and charismatic... Olga Krasko (Varya) was just as I imagined her while reading the book - a beautiful, but extremely naive young woman... Baluyev (general Sobolev) is in his usual war-hero-and-great-master-and-commander role...
Ellen Drew plays his wife (and victim) very charmingly, and Beulah Bondi, while given disappointingly little to do, is always a pleasure to watch.
What you're seeing on the screen in The Baron Of Arizona is a small encapsulation of an over 20 year effort by Reavis as played by Vincent Price to pull this thing off and to stay ahead of law enforcement who after a while smelled a very large rat.
Cut to murder scene and Jose hiding in the wings with a guy he finally Jose tries to get Gene to cover for him while hubby and a cop are searching a closet.
And what is a girl to do while under a spell?
It's old ground of course for all of them, Preminger and Tierney had teamed up in "Laura" and, with Hecht were to do so again in the soon-come "Where the Sidewalk Ends" while Hecht had previously turned psychoanalysis to thrilling effect in Hitchcock's "Spellbound".
He gets her to perform all kinds of shady deeds, while succeeding in getting her conscious mind to suppress it.
She is strangely drawn to him, while her dumbfounded husband can come to only one conclusion - that she and Korvo are involved in an illicit affair.
She's one of those great mixes in film noir of the noir-heroine and the femme fatale, while she may be on the right side of the law, she certainly is not pleased with society's assigned role of housewife (as her marriage offers her nothing) and so rebels against it.
To my mind, while this is not her best film (That being either THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR or LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN), this IS her finest acting work.
In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sense  If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud .
Like I said very poor taste   Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " No one knows this but it`s a scientific fact " ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel " .
War film logic dictates that both Americans, Germans and the occupied French will all understand each other while speaking fluent Americanese.
Played by German actress Erna SchÃ¼rer who spent most of the Seventies in more sleazy Italian fare such as Strip Nude For Your Killer and Deported Women of the SS Special Section, Jeanette willingly volunteers to become their tour guide, supposedly to save her husband, but after a while trapped in a tank full of sweating, leering Germans her motives are quite clear, showing off her flesh and playing the affections of one soldier against the other.
And as pure director of action sequences Besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters; it's succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave, chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with Bob.
3 Son" Tommy (Benson Fong) while both stay at a hotel.
And while Mantan's antics, especially his looks of fright, would probably not do in these politically correct times, he still can be entertainingly funny with what he does here and I don't think it reflects badly on his race at all since to me he's just a funny looking clown who's quite endearing, whatever the race.
The plots ended up confused and messy aimed more at Birmingham Brown and the Chan son of the film being silly while Charlie said wise things.
My point here is that while the animals certainly don't look like cartoons, they don't look "realistic" either.
All in all the movie goes on for about 10 minutes longer than it should have, and while the story is involving for sure it never really resonates on the emotional level that the subject matter would usually endow on a film.
There is some sort of feeling you get while watching this movie either for the first time or for the fourth time.
Is there such a thing as appreciating melodrama while being amused by it?
Howard was an open poem, while Bette felt in love with him, but Bogart (Duke Mantee) came to continue his devastating activity.
But there's a snag when a notorious gangster, Duke Mantee (Bogart), has to hold up at the bar with his fellow gangsters and holds everybody hostage while they wait.
While it was another payday for Howard and Davis, both very charming here, this was Bogart's big break (albeit it would be a while before he could shake his bad-guy act in his roles) and he takes it on for all its worth.
Bette Davis and Leslie Howard give classic 30's performances while Humphrey Bogart gives one for all ages around the interior of a roadside dirty spoon and filling station in the American South West.
Neither one of them belong in the desert, but while Alan is through with life's struggles, and Duke knows he's about to be through, Gaby is looking forward to them.
But in 1936 he proved that with great actors, outstanding cameramen and art directors, small miracles could be wrought right on the Warner Brothers back lot, and for a while at least the desert bloomed.
Dick Foran, playing a strapping and comical football star who pumps gas while always trying to woo Gabby, was very good in this film and it's probably the best work I've seen him do in movies, before he wound up as a "B" player for Universal.
Well, I like to see myself as an intelligent and experienced movie-watcher, but I had to read some of the comments here on IMDb to see the light: the woman was already dead and while she was on her desolate way to afterlife she was picked-up by Peter (!)
The Sycorax, while hardly the most terrifying aliens to ever appear in the show, make for a suitable opponent, certainly more so than the Slitheen and the Adipose.
I certainly didn't take to him as he falls out of the TARDIS bellowing " I dunnit " in his irritating mockney geezer accent but while being better in latter stories he is often quite worse so The Christmas Invasion deserves at least seven out of ten
It is beautifully shot with some of the finest acting i have seen in a long while, but then what else would you expect from a this cast list?
A woman falls in love while her husband is away in the war, and of course this causes trouble.
Porky Pig relishes the chance to play the villainous Lord High Chamberlain while Sylvester hams it up gloriously as the Grand Duke.
It manages to be funny while still masterfully tapping into the spirit of the adventure stories it spoofs
Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while Sylvester relishes his part as the Duke.
Whiel Scarlett goes a way for a while, leaving Melissa there in the open the Grand Duke arrives to refresh himself, only to find Melissa.
The longer version has only a few scenes more than the shorter version, and some of the same scenes go on a bit longer, but the tale is basically the same, for the extra scenes- while interesting, are not essential; such as Cosmo's banter with a cabby about their New York pasts, a tale on a gopher tail's causing botulism, and scenes outside a club.
And the way that Cassavetes opens and closes his film is most intriguing of all (if one is still watching by the end, as mentioned it might turn off some viewers expecting a more conventional narrative)- we see the singer, who has no self-confidence following night after night being booed while trying to have his own unique style in singing for the girls to dance to, and finally he just walks off after not being able to take any more (this is the last shot, following an ambiguous end for Cosmo, as his fate is left open to chance or damnation).
Its stylish while being minimalist at the same time, but this time around its even grittier and more claustrophobic than his previous work.
Many scenes begin in near blackness, and abruptly, LA sunlight streams into the murky darkness while actors lines ricochet and overlap.
And the question is: How many times do we get to see a close-up of Ben Gazzara rubbing his hand over his face while failing to convey ANY emotion in John Cassavetes' "The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie"?
Here Cassavetes wants us to believe that the girls dance in poorly-choreographed theme numbers while a fat, flamboyant MC sings torch songs in front of kindergarten-quality cardboard props.
Oh, Cosmo was evidently shot in the belly while offing the Coolie, a scene the director just didn't feel like filming!
(I love your brave quest for Absolute Reality, Mr. Cassavetes...) The magic bullet wound simply disappears while Cosmo visits his girlfriends, evades two mafia gunmen, gives a motivational speech to his employees and performs a one-man monologue on the cabaret stage... HOORAY!
At the end of the picture he says how important it is to "feel comfortable" with oneself and while we don't believe for a second that Cosmo really feels this way, we know he *wants* to.
I'm certainly going to go back and watch it again, probably several times -- because I'm going to have to live with this movie for a while before I can say I've come to terms with it.
Then, when attacked in a dark alley by the murderer in a car, while the murderer is threateningly -- but patiently -- gunning the engine in neutral apparently waiting for the cop to decide where to run, the cop runs straight for a fence, and the inevitable man-climbs-fence-while-chased-by-car scene, instead of calmly stepping back through the OPEN DOOR into the brick building he just came out of.
There's a scene where one guy is crying -- and i'm not making this up -- while passionately squeezing a handful of semi-digested peanuts.
At one point, echoing a scene from the former, Detective Cho (Suh-kyu Han) is lying exhausted in a rain-soaked alley way, while the killer sits waiting in his car, only two metres away; but instead of running Cho down, the killer screams away into the rain.
Through questioning and a series of flashbacks, it looks like Chae is in the frame; yet, murders continue while she is under surveillance.
Because Detective Oh (Yes that is his name), dies while the main villain is in the custody of the lead detective.
Fenn is most lovely, funny and sweet in her role as a glam girl while Piven delivers his usual rapid-fire, good-natured and comic performance as the unlikely suitor.
Wallace Shawn has a brief but important role as a fellow agent while Stephanie Miller, now a national talk show hostess, is a stitch as Shawn's reality-checking personal assistant.
Detective Cho and his force protect Su-Yeon and follows the leads based one the information she tells, while the killer executes other victims.
The acting is also remarkable, just as the sublime black humor that surfaces once in a while and the outrageously gory moments that will leave You gasping for breath even if You've seen many gorefests before.
2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
I've seen this entire series and while some are quite good, some are not.
Further, while Lisa Niemi (Mrs. Patrick Swayze) is a pretty inept actress, her camera setups superbly capture the dance.
His signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences, while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments.
They just spew out information, then add something like "Then I went home and drank soda while watching Survivor."
Popcultured is one of those shows that comes along once in a great while that is so incomprehensibly bad, you find yourself waiting for the camera to pan out revealing an appalled Jason Bateman watching it on his set as some sort of clever comment on the state of the TV nation.
Every once in a while, I find myself singing it - even now.
They really cared about the message of the movie, which was not an overt in-your-face thing, while at the same time understanding how eager many girls are to grow up at that age.
Re-watching Sooner or Later has me absolutely sick with nostalgia for those simpler times, and has triggered a ridiculous and sudden obsession with catching up with Rex Smith Â whom while I enjoyed his albums Sooner or Later and Forever when I was young, I never plastered his posters on my walls as I did some of my other faves.
She looks absolutely wonderful and, while I don't know what Sherilyn's like personally, gives Amanda such warmth and sincerity that it's hard NOT to fall in love with someone like her.
The Alternative Factor though wins the honor as a bottom 5 episode while Court Martial doesn't reach those absolute lows based on some decent acting scenes.
and the Enterprise crew hanging out in the recreation room smirking at the state of the canteen coffee while the goatee man prowls about looking ragged.
And while I do wish there had been more impact in these scenes, they do fulfill their purpose and complete the feeling of a "Peanuts world" I guess you could say.
There is a complicated scene where Woodstock has to walk on each of the sidewalk grate pipes to cross them while Snoopy just keeps walking.
I still dance a bit to the scene when Snoopy and Woodstock have a little concert while they set up camp and make dinner and YES!
"Race for Your Life" is much lighter in tone, while "Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown" is more shallow.
But after a short while I realized there are many sad parts in it, especially the good bye party.
Snoopy goes to Lila and while leaving his Doghouse with the "For sale or to let" sign on it Woodstock runs after him crying while we can hear this really sad song in the background which later Charlie Brown is singing in his deep depression.
Charlie Brown has been becoming ever more resentful of Snoopy's recent independence (in particular going to the beach to spend time with Peppermint Patty), and, after cutting his thumb while trying to open his can of dog-food, he gives Snoopy a scolding and makes him feel guilty and worthless.
my favorite peanuts cartoon with the best music ( me and you, two man crew) and Charlie Brown singing a melancholy tune about Snoopy being gone while putting his head against the wall.
Fowler, while full of profundity and fancy words, is used by the Communists to get out the story they want known.
A very well done thriller which addresses racism, colonialism, various "economic"isms, all the while focusing on the individual human impacts of high level decision-making.
Finally, I like Dean's conversation with the creepy family while he's tied to the chair.
My favorite part of the episode: Dean describing himself to Kathleen, while pretending to be a policeman.
One of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top.
Best of all, while Emmanuelle 1 seems horribly dated today, thanks mostly to the 1970's philosophizing of the Mario character, along with the tacky theme song, the second one has dated beautifully, thanks to the truly elegant and timeless fashion choices for Kristel and the rest of the cast, and also to the gorgeous soundtrack by celebrated composer Francis Lai.
Dean parks the car in a diner and waits in the car while Sam brings some fast food and pie.
Like "Emmanuelle, "Joys of a woman" wallows in pseudo-philosophy while displaying a lot of aroused women seeking satisfactionÂ The setting is Hong Kong, where Emmanuelle is taken through the high-life of the aristocratÂ   In Jack Jaeckin's first film, Emmanuelle was sexually reserved, and came out as she discovered her hidden sexualityÂ In the sequel, she explores further into the erotic domainÂespecially other womenÂin trying to find the perfect loverÂ   The characters are not real, but ethereal, dream-like creatures floating through lifeÂ This quality actually works quite well as Sylvia Kristel encounters other womenÂ The eroticism is soft and sensualÂ When she confronts a man, however, there is a feeling only of performanceÂ It's much more sharply refreshing and keenÂ The male lovers never seem to be as compassionate or as feeling as the women, nor are their characters as developedÂ   The photography is quite rich and luxuriant, and has captured a postcard view of modern Hong KongÂ
Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there (it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all) on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.
In addition, this is Kajol's first film after a self-imposed hiatus, while Aamir Khan, paired with her here for the first time, is also seen infrequently on screen due to his reputed fastidiousness in choosing movie projects.
Rehan is killed in a terrorist bomb blast, or so we are led to think, while the Indian authorities launch a search for the criminal mastermind that planned this and several similar attacks.
He does look too old to do the romantic shtick demanded of the Rehan character, but comes into his own while playing the older Major Ranjeev, a profoundly troubled man dealing with adult ethical, ideological, and moral conundrums.
Rishi Kapoor, Kiron Kher, Tabu, and others offer strong support, while child actor Ali Hajji as young Rehan is amazingly unaffected and natural.
One that apparently also provides them with super powers, like the ability to growl while they are under water.
The makers of "Chill", while sincere, failed to create the magic to move "Cool Air" (which this movie is based upon) from short-story written in 1926 to a contemporary story.
The starring couple (Vanessa Angel looking rather pouty with her botox-laden lips) starving for oxygen at the end while sitting in a diving prep room full of tanks (and them in wet suits).
Woman is unjustly jailed while driving cross-country, escapes prison with the help of convict Tommy Lee Jones.
The truth is that such things do happen and if nothing else the movie reminds us all that while it is good to try to help strangers in need,it is not wise to pick up hitchhikers.
Poor Dinah Hunter (Yvette Mimieux): through no fault of her own, she ends up incarcerated while driving from Los Angeles to New York.
Moreover, the film's astute depiction of the relative differences and similarities between cops and criminals is wickedly subversive: The crooks for the most part are loyal, honorable and compassionate folks while a majority of the police are total a**holes.
Parillaud's multi-layered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film.
I saw this movie about two years ago while I was up studying at around 4:00 A.M. Lee Marvin plays an outlaw that takes three runaway teens under his wing.
After escape home,three young man friends(Gary Grimes,Charles Martin Smith,Ron Howard) form an alliance, a dynamic trio trio combining raw untamed youth.They find an old man(Lee Marvin) with the experience only a master gun-fighter can offer.They formed his own gang and carried out a number of bank robberies and murders.They are converted an outlaws with a price on their heads.But they are trapped in Mexico,while awaiting trial in Mexico are released on bail by the bandit Spikes.The three young man accompanied by the veteran crook on the raid bank in which two of them were severely wounded.The lawmen formed a posse were engaged to hunt down the gang.
Coop had been around a while, working his way up from bit parts in the silent era, eventually garnering a few lead roles but not making a huge splash.
I've been a Joan fan for a while now, so when I saw the laser disc for this movie I got it right away.
The most memorable is the title song itself and off course, with Madhuri Dixit looking so slim and gorgeous, the dances are worth while watching.
The script, although dated, is often very funny and draws some fine characters, making the craziness that goes down pretty involving even while the technical ineptitude is offputting.
I think this movie, while dated due to some comments in the dialogue, is a great film about how priorities change as we grow older.
The four main characters in this movie all know this fact but find it out in one traumatic slap in the face evening while trying to drown the suburban noise in Phoenix Arizona.
Green was one of the better ones I've seen in a while.
Jennifer is a weary working woman, while her mother in-law Lajjo is a typical Punjabi mother in-law.
But while watching Indian films, one must get over such hurdles to appreciate them.
In this particular one, a nice sweet girl, an insurance company employee, meets a strange vet who is quite mysterious ans fascinating, while a serial killer with a scalpel kills women in the area : we are just like Isabelle CarrÃ© (perfect as usual), because BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is a pure magnet.
Brunette whereas Claire is blonde, sexually and personally "liberated", while Claire is a slave to her family and job, wisecracking where Claire is austere.
I'm sure that METHOD will be a film that I will chew on for a while, trying to learn more about it, trying to figure out things that confused me, like: What happened to the little Romanian hottie that Rebecka picked up in the bar???
The restaurant scenes were filmed in Cobham Surrey, while Jill's hairdressers was filmed in Byfleet, Surrey.
The second series was filmed in Cornwall, UK where there is also a village called Hersham consisting of six houses while the main Hersham has population of some 18,000 people.
Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football.
Tony has mistress problems, and a wife (Edie Falco) who puts up with a lot because she loves him, all the while keeping ties to her Catholic religion.
Familiar faces such as Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley, Lauren Bacall, Will Arnett, Nancy Sinatra, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick, Hal Holbrook, Burt Young, and Eric Mangini make appearances over the course of the show, while names as notable as Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, and Steven Van Zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series.
In the end, he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath, and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos.
The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew ,however, Tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent.
Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5, while remaining better than anything else on television.
A message movie, intended to bring home to those lucky enough to have seen it exactly the things that have made so many squirm while watching it.
She brought much passion into this role, and while she appeared a little "girlish" initially, the character had to grow out of her pampered life for us to follow her across the borders both real and metaphoric.
The excellent production design, cinematography and poignant music moved the story forward, but while I loved this subject matter, I also felt the transitions between three very distant locations caused the film to feel somewhat disjointed.
Moreover, it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick (Clive Owen), while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them, but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.
Like "The Crow" before it, "Dark City" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been.
William Hurt sadly gets too little to do as the fastidious Inspector Bumstead, while Colin Friels plays the borderline psychotic "Frank" with glee.
Their house and how it's positioned is just beautiful while at the same time creepy, and how all the lines in the movie were so tastefully said made me give this movie the rating that I gave it.
When you compare this with the box office success of a film like the Matrix which while being a good film still falls well short of the tale being told in Dark City, it seems that people on the whole don't want intelligent science fiction but the typical pap that hollywood is too eager to churn out for the masses.
The special effects (while spectacular) never encroach or overtake the character development.
Even more weird is when at the stroke of midnight, the city changes shape while everyone sleeps.
So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.
(It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.
No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make "Air Force One" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.
Oldman plays it like he means it, killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane.
The writer even had the decency to have Oldman deliver lines condemning the president for bombing villages while being against terror.
The Press simply abdicated its Fourth Estate responsibility through fear of reprisals from the Bush administration, while the Congress dared not go against the Bush propaganda machine for fear that it would be labeled anti-American.
In fact their cowardly and irresponsible behavior was deeply anti-American while it was solidly pro-Bush.
The plot while a little clichÃ© is alright, it keeps you watching for some reason.
Movies this bad tend to kill a lot of actors careers or at least push them out of the spotlight for a while.
It seemed like a nod towards Shawshank while at the same time mocking Dilbert farms.
The very ending scene while panning to see the sun I thought was a little overdone.
The movie has the insight of Office Space while loosing none of the style of Shawshank.
I'm Doug Van Doren, the writer and producer of this movie and I just checked in with some of the user comments and votes for the first time in a while.
These wonderful people are families first and their sexuality, while it is important does not define them exclusively.
Adam & Evil starts as a group of high school friends intend to celebrate graduation by driving to some old camp & spending the night there, while stopped off at a bar the local Sheriff Earl (Jodie Graham) & his wife Maureen (Alison Warnyca) warn them that the camp they are going to was once the site of grisly murders but they should be OK anyway.
The film doesn't feel too long, the character's are slightly better than usual for this type of film, there are a couple of OK kills & the basic who did it murder mystery while not groundbreaking will probably keep you watching & guessing until the end I suppose.
One of the boys is seduced by the slut wife of the local sheriff, while the group is chased by two bad elements from their school.
The closest thing you get is Eastern philosophy from Douglas's friend and racing assistant, Tennessee Steinmetz (the lovable Buddy Hackett) a Jewish man who learned, while on a trip to Tibet that life is everywhere, even in mechanical objects like traffic lights and cars.
However, Dean Jones' play is equally recommendable, as the heroic lead is a much less rewarding role in pictures like this - while Tomlinson can just go for full throttle lovable nastiness, Jones needs to provide just the right dosages of heroism, arrogant charm, etc.
Just don't take it too seriously (because you can't) and let yourself be a kid for a while.
Soon Jim, Herbie and Tennessee are winning races and Jim's ego inflates while Thorndyke's temper grows since he too races and loses every time to Herbie.
It woulda been worth our while for the two of them to escape off in the plane.
And while I'm on the subject of the plot, I felt it was fairly obvious from the start who was behind it all and yet, our heroes have to go through Hell and back (and a utterly pointless sex scene) before finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
while every single policeman tends to their "dirty sanchez" moustache and perfects their dodgy Mexican accent.
It follows photo-journalist R.J.O'Brien (Craig Sheffer), who is jailed by corrupt South American police while investigating the murder of an environmental activist, being released when rain forest activist Alyssa (Sandra Bullock) kindly tells the police he is harmless.
Feeling the answer lies with the hanged Indian's tribe they paddle up river into the jungle, unaware that the real murderer is stalking them until R.J. gets shot, but they escape to Indian territory where they are stalked again, and R.J. yells loudly while trying to lose them.
The engaging story is a sort of complement of "Hotel Rwanda" and "Shooting Dogs", focused in the romance of a Canadian journalist and a Tutsi waitress, but disclosing also the genocide of the Tutsis in the landscape of a troubled Rwanda while the West simply ignored and turned back to the fate of millions of people.
He rows the boat in the general direction of the U-boat's mother ship while he sings German folk songs and the others tootle along, accompanying him on a flute.
In fact, it's amazing just how well Hitchcock does do this; while they were starving, I was too!
Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching.
The movie, while wonderfully developing its own nine characters, also raises questions aimed at the viewer, pointedly questioning how each one of us would react in those certain situations.
Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret.
Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery.
John Hodiak (very handsome) is her enemy (at first), while Walter Slezak, Hume Cronin, William Bendix and the others ably support.
The film is set in World War IIÂ An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboatÂ The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboatÂ   At first they were prepared to throw him overboard Â but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took commandÂ Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply shipÂ  Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the NaziÂ As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt waveÂ  It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the timeÂ Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was goingÂ Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service (which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made) and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier, he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while Â in a rather unsubtle piece of direction Â framed by Tower Bridge.
Not as complex as I've heard it made out (admittedly the DVD age means I can zip straight to the exposition scenes without effort, which helps), The Long Good Friday is still a breathtakingly audacious film and one that at times runs a real risk of alienating its audience while still retaining mass appeal.
It blends together elements of various crime subgenres: it takes the criminal-turns-detective idea from Get Carter and marries it to the sickly, sleazy decadence that Scarface would portray so unflinchingly three years later, while the outlandish, ostentatious tactics Shand employs to intimidate his enemies come straight from The Godfather.
No wonder the film's original backers got cold feet, since while it doesn't in any way romanticise them it does portray them as the very essence of power.
The camera focuses in close up on the face of Bob Hoskins for over a minute, while the very catchy theme music plays, and while Hoskins, without a word of dialogue, goes through a whole raft of emotions, showing a man struggling to accept that he is finished, but is finally resigned to his fate.
Probably because its best not to think about it too much while watching DMDWP.
Even Raymond Chandler had trouble keeping up with The Big Sleep while he was writing it!
Living high on success while fancying himself a political entrepreneur, he's about to close a lucrative partnership deal with the Yanks when the Irish Republican Army, bent on revenge, begins eliminating operatives from his "organization", undermining his reputation.
Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.
This is the second great collaboration he did with the writer/director Carl Reiner, and while the man with two brains may be more laugh out loud funny, there have been few films more clever inventive and downright audacious in their attempt to recreate a bygone era by basically, well, stealing it!
In fact, while touching upon Berry's low points may have made it more interesting, it would've detracted from the entertainment value.
The best scene is with Chuck reciting a William Wordsworth poem from memory while Robbie Robertson strums his guitar.
If you don't smile while watching the concert footage, you don't love rock 'n' roll.
The scene where he goes with her to get diplomatic immunity was unrealistic, due to the fact that the boy (I refuse to say his name) is not American, and would be turfed out in a second, while the American girl gets immunity.
I think it's an extraordinary question of cinematographic life how movies like Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, The (2002) received an 8.7 and stands just below The Godfather, while such jewels like "Pearls before Swine" got an 3.1 (last time i checked).
in fact in one scene he quotes his own book, while pretending to be reading it from someone else's But that's not the point.
He also has a knack for hanging out with all the real artists while they do good things that he mocks with his bad products.
This sequel is very much that, all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter, Eating Out .
I thought Brett Chukerman really mastered the role of confident guy on the prowl for his next conquest as he teased Troy while changing for art class in the restroom.
I saw it toward the end of its run, and boy am I glad I caught it while it was still in theaters.
This movie while not perfect is just another one of Steve Martin's good comedies of the 1980's where he was on fire in my opinion.
This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.
The only creative idea is that while someone drinking tea or yogurt don't ask what time is it.
On the contrary, you just happen to understand that a very brutal action carries on while you don't actually see it.
Charles Farrell, a big star himself a few years previous, does a fine job as Shirley's dad, while Claude Gillingwater once again has fun with the part of a crotchety, rich old man.
Also the finale while silly is great fun.
Once in a while, a television series will come along that is smart, funny, and honest.
At least the show will live on for a while on Fox Family.
Furthermore, while being a comedy series, it doesn't hesitate to explore the drama present in the characters' lives and draws very real characters, who may seem like archetypes at first, but end up being a lot more than you might think.
(There's a priceless deleted scene on the DVD called "our creepiest moment" where Sam and Cindy slow dance while singing the slow part of "Come Sail Away".).
The Geeks often provided the comical element to the show, while the Freaks often explore more dramatic story lines such as problems with parents (a constant subplot), self-esteem, drugs, and more.
I would also like to say while I adored nearly every character on the show (except for Nick who's obsession with Lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre, but a boring character), I thought Martin Starr was the best as the witty Bill Haverchuck (I love his Bionic Woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the Halloween episode).
And, while he was not in the show but sporadically, I also loved 'Harris,' the Geek mentor who always seemed so confident about everything.
The next day, while playing golf, he shoots a miraculous putt and claims he 'hypnotized the ball' into the hole.
His best friend challenges Charley to prove it by hypnotizing him and while Charley works his hocus pocus, an errant golf ball beans his pal, stunning him into a zombie-like state.
It turns out his wife only pretends to be hypnotized into being a "good fellow" and makes him jealous, seeming to head out for a night on the town while he makes the titular poker game.
This a good example of the kind of sophisticated comedy Charley Chase could produce while still engaging in the kind of visual humor that has him hiding from police officers in a bright raincoat on a clear night.
I couldn't stop slapping my knee while I read it the first time.
I had a hard time understanding why the title of the film was "Summer Rain" while the Spanish title was "The English Road".
And I must say, that while it is a pathetic teen-targeted horror film (and directed even further at Black and probably Hispanic audiences), it was about a zillion times better than most of the pretty white teen "horror" movies I have seen (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and all of their nauseating sequels to boot).
say that to yourself while you watch it and you won't hate it so much.
My boyfriend and I saw it at Kendall Square Cinema on opening night and howled with laughter all the way through -- while everyone else sat in stony silence.
And while the acting is terrible, truly terrible, the writing and direction are first rate.
The dialog gets deep into Raymond Chandler/Dashiell Hammett hard-boiled private-eye stylishness, serving up gumshoe-with-dame clichÃ©s just juiced up enough to give Steve something to run with, while still offering an a solid story.
)viewers during a swim while her employer is away, eventually falling prey to the monster..told she was too old for the desired lead role she so covets, Lynn's rage causes the beast to rear it's ugly head.
The "rescuer" at one point starts to sing "America the Beautiful" at one point while they are engaged in debate over the victim's homosexuality and the brutality of the attack.
Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick.
One of the boys is very much a responsible home-maker while the other is a pot-head.
The two meet at a party where they, 'bump heads' while reaching for a can of beer.
Their friendship builds when they go out to a nightclub and again, 'bump heads' while looking around the club at the people dancing.
The two men appear to be very superstitious about love, the office worker always referring to his 8-ball for answers, while the bicycle courier counts his odds by flipping quarters.
And while this was no masterpiec of television entertainment, it was certainly, in my own opinion much more intriguing than Reality TV, and even some of the police dramas that are so popular on the Big Three (NBS, ABC, CBS).
Milland, while unexpectedly resourceful and tough, is impossible to take seriously as an action hero, with his frilly shirts, fey curls and elegant elocution.
The 'spectacular' squid finale, while bereft of tension (due to DeMille's ignorance of the basic laws of film) is a minefield of sexual innuendo.
Miguel is cool and smart while Chato takes care of the dirty work.
The drillers make friends with the Cajuns, while off- camera the rig strikes a pocket of gas.
while they followed rather simple people using simple tools (harpoons and fish hooks mostly) this film introduces industry as man's tool in conquering nature.
as i perused some of the dvd extras i discovered why this is...it turns out that standard oil commissioned the production and requested a film that showed the beauty of humanity and positive impact oil can have while being entertaining all the while.
The plot of the story, while easy enough to understand, is too thin - there isn't any conflict.
I have a lot to say about this movie but I am going to keep it short,  I am currently in IRAQ and I think I needed something that really brings me to a real world and that was Whirly girl, It really make me forget the rockets for a little bit, actually they did shut a rocket while I was watching, didn't run to the bunker,(crazy ain't)   Julian Morris did a great job and the stripper Â.OMGÂÂÂ she make the movie even better.
Some kind of apocalyptic event has taken place while the protagonist was riding the train.
This movie is hard to score because it excels at one thing while failing miserably at another.
Yes, the two leads are rather dull and the complete breakdown of society in about 48 hours, while explained by a few throwaway lines of dialog is a little hard to swallow.
Sometimes sequences seem to go on a bit too long, while others are too speedy.
Each time, scheduling conflicts and studio pressure curtailed the pairings, and one can only daydream about what might have been...  "Reap the Wild Wind", the one film Duke DID make with DeMille (one of SEVEN 1942 productions he starred in), while not 'top-drawer', is still a rousing Technicolor adventure, offering another of DeMille's 'American history lessons'.
"Reap the Wild Wind", while certainly a career 'boost' for the Duke, is not generally listed among his best films (or DeMille's), but remains an entertaining time-passer from early in WWII, the heady days of John Wayne's meteoric rise to superstardom.
The film makes a subtle and brilliantly presented point while interesting to watch.
Critics and reviewers are saying this movie meets its stated goals: educating while gripping the audience, not being preachy or propaganda, just telling it like it is.
And the best part: it's thrilling and exciting while it's doing it!
However, being villains, our hero and his gang of merry men, while on the way to the villains' fortress, get to dispatch them one by one in deadly, bloody fashion.
A dream Lynch's niece had while in school inspired it.
Lynch is a genius at making sound affect imagery beyond levels that most directors use, and while the sound in this short are much more self-conscious and much more apparent than the underlying growling of most of his work, it's a lot more effective.
There's actual film shot of Lynch's wife Peggy going rather bonkers while in a bed.
It's in black and white and shows a girl who looks like she's going completely mad while the letters of the alphabet go flying around her.
Based on an actual event, Lynch's niece had a nightmare where she recited the alphabet in her sleep, this film is basically the same thing, with a young woman reciting the alphabet in her sleep while we see nightmarish imagery.
With so many movies around, "The Journey of Natty Gann" is worth its while.
Andy Garcia, an actor which hasn't played in a good movie for a while is perfect for his "tough new cop" role.
Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme).
The acting is superb, and while Connery was the one who received his well-deserved Oscar, Kostner and De Niro made Oscar-class performances too.
The pilot in a nutshell: Aquababy is born floating in Caribbean waters, Aquaboy is flying in a seaplane with Aquamommy piloting, seahorsey necklace glows to indicate underseabaddies close and causing trouble with glowing waterspouts shooting up from a dead calm sea, plane ditches underwater, Aquamommy with superwaterstrength yanks Aquaboy free from seat-restraints and kicks heavy plane door open, Aquaboy floats to surface while watching slithering seaSirenbaddie attack Aquamommy in shadows of sinking seaplane, Aquaboy is brought traumatically to surface by a pod of whales; cut to present day, Aquamantwentysomething (who looks younger/punyer than his teen Smallville predecessor) goes through a weak reveal as an angst ridden man who can't let go of his past and fears wrought by his Aquaboy incident.
Overall though, I enjoyed it...There's a lot to work with, but I fear if certain aspects (as mentioned above) are not payed attention to the show will end up being mediocre while it could be GREAT.
In the television world, what they call "content" is the commercials they want us to watch while the "filler" is just the show that comes in between the ads.
The beginning which finds George Kennedy and Don Murray grabbing two kids and putting them in a fallout shelter while black and white footage of the atom bomb dropping is admittedly a stylish start.
You've got potential complicated relationships -- a young cutie guy who hits on all the bikini babes he can, finds out he's a lost prince, becomes an unselfish do-gooder when he'd rather party while still wanting to solve the disappearance of his mother.
It's a pity more episodes weren't made -- could've started a new trend -- a canceled show never airs but becomes a hit while viewed on itunes and then becomes a major motion picture.
Often times the camera is filming NOTHING...for several minutes, apparently while the director lights up another Doob and the cast and crew are flogging themselves for their involvement in this wretched wretched film.
Though undeniably enjoyable, the popular poliziottesco subgenre - which proliferated in Italy throughout the 1970s - is also frustrating because one can never tell the quality of a specific title until one has watched it himself (this is mainly due to the fact that this type of film has been largely dismissed by the critics, while at the same time turned into a cult by fans): the thing is that a handful of titles definitely merit a critical re-appraisal, while many others are overrated by the aficionados.
The action is raw and well-made and enthralling, and while the story may not be the most original, it is definitely more than well-executed.
I'm a big fan of these Italian crime flicks, and while Emergency Squad may not be the best one to come out of Italy during the seventies; it's decent enough and does deliver most of what I have come to expect from this sort of film.
Minor Spoilers  In New York, Joan Barnard (Elvire Audrey) is informed that her husband, the archeologist Arthur Barnard (John Saxon), was mysteriously murdered in Italy while searching an Etruscan tomb.
Minor Spoilers  In New York, Joan Barnard (Elvire Audrey) is informed that her husband, the archaeologist Arthur Barnard (John Saxon), was mysteriously murdered in Italy while searching an Etruscan tomb.
Every once and a while, a redundant character is killed off by a pair of unidentifiable hands that clearly adore twisting people's necks around!

i think the Bernie mac is one of the greatest comedies ever, Bernie always talking negative about the kids and how much trouble they are but the show seems to teach morals while still being funny at the same time.
This theme was harmonized by seeing Bernie doing similar things for Jordan, while Jordan faked gratitude to manipulate Bernie.
which may or may not be closely related to his social persona (while not "on" as the comedian).
And since I never saw it while it was new, all the reruns are new to me.
Anyway, while not in the same rarefied league of such Warners gangster flix as "Angels With Dirty Faces" and "The Roaring Twenties," this Bogey outing is still lots of fun.
Here they play two cons: Raft planning to go straight and provide for his Mom and kid brother while Bogey returns to his criminal ways.
Larry Wilson (Powell)while saving a stranger's life, receives a blow on the head.
The boys get in trouble when they mistake a satchel of securities for their supply of lipsticks and are hunted down by a pair of detectives, while Ms. Frisby's manager is planning to ruin the boys by turning over the securities as well as Ms. Frisby by sabotaging her entry in the transcontinental race.
Initially, it is restricted to a history lecture inspired by sites visited along the Mediterranean coast, while later it goes on and on about philosophical/political/whatever issues.
"'s becomes really annoying after a while.
Please excuse me while i go watch this AGAIN!
And, as another reviewer has pointed out, stilted passages (which appear to be copied from slightly out-of-date guide books) are spoken by characters who appear here and there to give us some predigested geographical and historical information while the Acropolis, the Sphinx, Hagia Sophia etc.
It is a fun thing to remember, that the little girl main actress in this film was really crying in the lap of her real mother after the movie was over and while there was a standing ovation.
This movie is going to softly talk to you, while cruising around the most beautiful places of the world, and will bring you to a sudden, explosive, unexpected ending.
This filmed talked to me, while i could do nothing but sit still and wait and listen and watch and then give one of the most sincere applauses i ever could give to a movie.
Its mostly Hatton stalking through the night for the first half while the police, played with less than all seriousness try to catch him.
Now he's out to strike back at those he blames for his situation, while forming a tender friendship with a blind girl, Helen Paige (the wonderfully beautiful Jane Adams), who is therefore not bound by any fear of his appearance.
Even if one didn't know about Curly's career-ending stroke while filming this, one has to wonder why his character never comes back after walking off to go sit down -- his absence from the rest of the film is obvious and makes no sense.
It's hard to imagine them having to be funny on film for the next several years while seeing Curly waste away, or during 1956 having to pretend the late Shemp was still filming with them.
But make it worth your while to go see this film, it's worth it.
Having been raised on 50s pulp detective novels (hence their names) while confined to an underground bomb shelter, they emerge 15 years after a nuclear war has turned the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
i stopped while this was on.
Enjoy it while you can - though presumably as a BBC Films production it'll be on the small screen soon - big screens are better!
The Boys were a perfect comedy duo and their movies are always great fun to watch (here they try to promote flavored lipsticks and get involved in a cross-country auto race, while keeping one jump ahead of the law ).
So Rose pursues one of the Americans, Cassandra deals with first love, spurning one suitor while secretly pining for another.
And another thing, Charlize has a deep voice, while the real Aileen has a high pitched shrilly voice.
What is most interesting is that another individual ended up living in the woods with her for a while.
The film paints a portrait of a troubled woman who descends into paranoid schizophrenia as the end nears all the while maintaining the unexpectedly undaunted, matter-of-fact demeanor of one very much reconciled to her fate in spite of being trapped in a system with no recompense for abuse in childhood nor insanity in adulthood who well may have been failed by the criminal justice system as well.
The soundtrack is, once again, the handiwork of Carlo Rustichelli â but, while serving its purpose, isnât especially remarkable within the impressive pantheon of Spaghetti Western scoresâ¦
Variously titled overseas as either "Revenge In El Paso" or "Four Gunmen of Ave Maria," this handsomely-produced, elaborately-staged, sun-drenched, shoot'em up shares something in common with the Lee Van Cleef oater "Death Rides A Horse" (1968) in that our lice-ridden hero (EIi Wallach) got double-crossed by his outlaw buddies and left behind for the law to catch while they made good their escape.
Italian western buffs who aren't familiar with this well choreographed dustraiser need to saddle up and watch the bare bones Paramount DVD with enhanced widescreen to see what other less well-known helmers were doing with the genre while Leone rode herd over sagebrushers.
All the women are hot and while they appear in some provocative outfits and there are "sexual situations" nobody actually has sex.
Its hard to find a movie that is both so much fun to watch while being so terrible.
I was hesitant to watch this movie based solely on the first ten minutes because it was so cheesy, but after a while I eased into it and found that this movie was so bad and so cheesy, it was good.
I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.
this deranged killer was far more interesting and sadistic, (it seems they took ideas from jack the ripper with the killer in black with brief case and piercing eyes while walking round misty murky streets)) there is one scene near the beginning, a killing of an actress that is so bloody and gore fested that at 14 i threw up.
I could definitely have done with more gore, for while the kills are well filmed and have the rare skill of being effective without being graphic, there aren't too many and there are only really three notable grisly moments.
Its good fun while it lasts but it does rather streak by and afterwards I did have a number of questions about various plot and character points.
It takes a while to get going but I never found it boring or felt my interest was waining, the characters are pretty strong & enough happens to satisfy & entertain.
The gory premise allows for some great physical horror, while the actual story is interesting enough to keep you watching for more than just the shocks.
Famed world leaders from far left to far right are given time to express their varied opinions, while the viewer is allowed to reach a personal conclusion.
It's an obvious tribute to novels like "1984", and while not as well executed as that novel, there is something to be said for the startling visuals presented on such a low budget that bring to life the horrors of a totalitarian regime.
The late, great, sorely missed George "Buck" Flower (who co-wrote the trashy script with Goff) has a hilarious cameo as a deranged machete-wielding lunatic who chases his real-life daughter Verkina around a mangy warehouse while repeatedly exclaiming, "I'm gonna cut all that poison out!"
This is a movie with Fat Cop syndrome (two of them, actually, with one in drag for a while, I kid you not), a pink shirted sex pervert who has girlie magazine centerfolds pinned to the walls of his living room (presumably to comfort audience members who may be afraid he is gay), a second murdering loon who shouts "COME HERE LITTLE GIRL" so loudly and so often that we had to turn it down lest the neighbors think we were enjoying it (turns out he's her father, how charming), and for about fifteen minutes the movie tries to develop tension by having a repeating high pitched ticking sound clatter on and on and ON to the point where you start looking around the room wondering what the heck that noise is, and how do I stop it.
This movie starts out that there is a maniac at a drive-in movie theatre that sneaks around and kills all these people while they are at a drive in.
This film opens with the on screen caption "on August 10th in a California Drive-In it all began..." A young couple are murdered while sitting in their car at a drive-in watching a film, by an unknown psycho with a large oriental sword.
Second, while the ending was stolen from William Castle's film THE TINGLER, it still was a good ending for this exploitation film--and ending this dreck on a positive note.
She doesn't care what others think about it--whether it's wearing a red dress to a ball while others consider that 'taboo' or sitting out on the porch with the slaves, singing spirituals.
The owner of the drive-in theatre, Austin Johnson (played by a man known only as Newton Naushaus), has some snide but humorous one-liners, especially while chiding the police.
It could very well be the incredibly cranky, ornery, and all-around rude theater manager, Austin Johnson(Newton Naushaus)whose foul attitude stinks something rotten;once the barker, he has been left to take care of the entire business while his former employer sold the farm and ran off to Hawaii or some place.
I also enjoyed the opening beheading..but director Seagall doesn't quite match this with the subsequent killings(..one victim's head falls off and a couple is skewered by the dreaded sword while hugging).
The really oddball sequence where Larry and Mike are questioning Orville in his home(..with nude posters of models pinned all over his living room walls)really has to be seen to be believed..seeing Orville squirming and wallowing in misery over his sexual appetites(..he even admits out loud to "beating his meat" while at the drive-in, completely overwhelmed in embarrassment!
)while the detectives appear quite appalled.
This is not the worst film of its genre, and I'd watch it again with friends who want to make fun of something while we get drunk.
For example, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is about far more than some maniacs and some lost teens; it is about the ability of limited, wrongheaded personalities to destroy more developed ones, and the tendency of the devouring mentality, as it appears in its many forms, to consume things of value while contributing nothing in return.
Warning: while Joe Bob Briggs and Sid Haig are featured in the credits, they are only in the film for a few seconds each.
Some of the filmmakers are egotistical to a laugh-out-loud degree while others are quiet and more grounded and realistic about the business they have chosen to be in.
It is a shame that so many talented film makers out there never get a chance to film their visions due to a lack of funding, while a piece of crap like this gets made.
With little exposure beyond HBO screenings, Stardom continues to be true to the reality TV trend, yet, while it was ahead of its time, particularly in comments about full frontal nudity and Meg Ryan that unfortunately have come true, Arcand's film is often so subtle its droll satire flies over the heads of an unreflective public failing to grasp the humor and truth of the informed filmmaker.
Every once in a while, you need to watch a stupid movie just for the heck of it.
Mr. Natural: "Don't Mean Sheeit..."  One day while searching through my father's closet (about 12 years ago) I happened to come across a couple of comic books.
I've put if off for a while now, but I put it in last night, and I was immediately brought back to that same type of infatuation with drawing.
R. Crumb was hardly inhibited while Zwigoff was filming him, nor were the other people who were interviewed.
This is an honest portrait of an artist, like him or not, it's well done, and certainly thought provoking; and while he may not be the best spoken man on earth I thought the film was amazing.
We have endured decades of degeneration of our own traditional values by our home-grown liberals, while they infected our lives with welfare excess, crime toleration, agenda-based education, personal merit based on skin color rather than character, the eradication of our religion, and the trashing of our Founding Fathers.
But while she too is at the center of the story, the story is epic in describing the Civil War's affect on Atlanta and Georgia, and the slow "Reconstruction" of the economy there in the late 1860s and 1870s.
Norma Shearer and Robert Morley give fantastic performances as the King and Queen of France, who live in luxury while their subjects starve.
Her delightful performance makes this a film to be cherished as we see her as a giddy youth while she enjoys being the dauphine, flirtatious nature with Count Fersen, loving queen to Louis XVI, anxious escapee during Flight to Varennes, horrified spouse when she learns of her husbands fate, terrified parent when her child is taken from her & dignified condemned prisoner as she rides in the cart & up the stairs to die are all moments is this wonderful movie than begin when the movie begins & wont ever end in your mind.
This project which took a while to go into production, was a vehicle for his wife, the reigning queen of MGM, Norma Shearer.
As for Power... remember the anecdote about the reporter asking romance-writer Barbara Cartland (Lady Di's stepmother) how she could possibly have written so many romance novels before she was even married and while she was still a virgin?
Power was the inspiration for Barbara Cartland to say, when asked how she could write so convincingly about sex while she was a still a virgin, "We didn't need sex.
The rape scene has a dramatic almost horror score while the scenes of Night New York are very quiet and gloomy  A shame is that Charles Bronson got a stigma on playing a Vigilante(4 sequels,from which only part 3 is not bad.
One night while walking, a junkie tries to rob him, and becomes Bronson's first vigilante kill.
This movie, while presenting all the darker elements of human nature, is a good movie from a historical perspective and proving once again "revenge" will always sell theatre tickets!  
The greatest scene in the movie has got to be the humiliating Olympus Ball sequence, with Davis beginning to have second thoughts when she is ostracized by hundreds of aghast eyes, leering at her and Fonda as they waltz around an abandoned dance floor while she wears that controversial dress.
Bronson is highly effective here; while not one of the great actors, he has a very strong screen presence.
The film does wonders with its historical setting, New Orleans a short while before the Civil War.
At present(2009) while the remake version is being filmed I have to say that; no matter who will perform Paul Kersey for the second time, he won't be able to impress us as Bronson did.
This development was so modern and original, after a while it changed the outlook of the Crime genre.
He takes a job working for a land developer in New Mexico to get his mind off his troubles, and while there his long dormant fascination with guns is renewed when his client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) shows off his personal collection and lets him crack some shots off.
Kersey soon realizes the cathartic release of enacting vigilante revenge as the media reports his killings and other private citizens take action, all while police officer Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) leads a task force to capture the vigilante and stop future violence.
I saw this film randomly the other day while at a friend's house.
Director John Williams captures the beauty of rural Japan and the wide cultural gap as well as geographical contrast between the urban teenager's Nagoya (fourth largest municipality in Japan) and Koide-san's farm house up on the hill in the Oku Mikawa Highland region, while on the interpersonal and spiritual levels connecting the common elements between these two women from two different generations.
I love GWTW, but "Jezebel" works as well or better at capturing the same basic period in US history, while also keeping you waiting expectantly for the heroine's next outlandish maneuver.
*SPOILER ALERT*  AFTER HOURS has typically been viewed as one of Martin Scorsese's minor films, but this excellent, frenetically-paced dark comedy works at a number of levels, while also Â perhaps unintentionally Â raising a few provocative questions.
Mick Travis wanted to succeed in life while Paul Hacket only wanted some fun night and perhaps to get close to a beautiful woman he'd met earlier (Rosanna Arquette).
This is one of those films that takes a little while to seem to be about anything, but once it gets going, it really takes you in with it.
These scenes with actor Griffin Dunne running through the streets in the middle of the night are the highlights of the film - he witnesses a shooting while hiding up a fire escape, and says almost to camera: "I'll probably get blamed for that."
The whole effort contributes to the anxious nature of the story and of how Paul never feels completely grounded while he's out of his territory.
All this while the doctors try to figure out why Eddie has mutated to this form.
I really wanted a more thought-out ending--maybe where she did go with Fonda into quarantine but only to try to win him back or perhaps him dying and her going about her merry way while hardly skipping a beat.
"Blackenstein" is original and funny because of its ineptness, but after a while it nearly becomes unendurable to sit through.
And ah, let's see...I can't leave out the hilariously inappropriate music that pops up from time to time, offering shock and suspense cues while actors walk leisurely through hallways or glance around aimlessly.
He just wants revenge against his partner who betrayed him, and if he dies while doing it, so be it.
It takes a while for Ira to get to the bottom of what's been going on between Birdwell and the Whitings but with the help of screwy pseudo-philosophical Margo, who turns out to be a lot smarter then Ira at first thought, he puts all the pieces together.
Howard Duff's scene early in the film and even his character's name evoke The Big Sleep while Chandler allusions continue through the film.
The main character has difficulty walking without tripping, accidentally exposes himself to nearly every other character in the movie, and finds it necessary to practice putting a condom on a banana around his friend's waist while receiving direction, despite clearly labeled instructions provided with all condoms.
Bette Davis is Julie and while she's going to be married to the very proper Henry Fonda, she likes the idea that she can still turn the head of every young blade in New Orleans.
Fonda goes north and returns after a while to New Orleans with Margaret Lindsay who he is now married to.
Throughout the film, there are parodies of both GINO and INDEPENDENCE DAY (one scene had a taxi driver in Shinjuku getting out of his taxi, staring dumbfounded at the UFO while his car gets smashed by another!
This bodes ill for the whole "millenium" series that follows, and indicates why this Godzilla series, while developing a cult of its own, lost the interest of many older fans.
And that is the point of this movie, to remind every one of us who grew up on monster movies that in the midst of all the ALIEN-stylized cinematic drool, that the giant UFO perched menacingly over Tokyo, shimmering with mysterious electronic pulsations while Godzilla ( with an underwater swimming scene for Godzilla that is priceless) stomps in for a classic samauri-like duel with the alien craft and its occupant, with all the Man In Suit and b-movie special effects you can stand, is the reason why many of us "creature feature" lovers continue going to the movies TODAY, because we're looking for something like GODZILLA 2000.
Sutherland stars with Sean Connery and Leslie-Anne Down in a bawdy and fun caper to rob a train while moving of a gold shipment of Â£25,000 heading to pay British soldiers in the Crimean War.
But Crichton also notes the irony of the way the public attack the train thieves while embracing the idiots running the Crimean War that the gold was for.
The First Great Train Robbery is set in Victorian England in 1855 during the Crimean War while Great Britain was at war with Imperial Russia, to pay the soldiers Â£25,000 worth of gold is transported to the Crimean Peninsula every month starting at the London branch of the Huddleston and Bradford bank & across England by train in two several inch thick safe's which require four keys to open.
The acting is very good with Sean Connery making a very likable villain but one who also has a dark side when needed, British ballet dancer Wayne Sleep did all his own stunts including scaling that prison wall while there are numerous other notable faces involved.
Of course the bad guys are all colorful characters with not only shrewdness but wit to match, while the upright members of society who hold the keys to the gold are painted as bland and stodgy bores.
Many believed that Warner Brothers purposely created an impossible deal to punish Davis for the lawsuit while making it appear they were trying to help her.
In one of his earliest credited roles, albeit as Buchinsky, Bronson plays one of the heavies while Kirk plays Nelson's concerned wife.
The movie replays the same plot over from the first candy-man movie, minus any real horror or suspense, while D'Errico prances about in very tight clothes, panties, and tank tops made for infants.
In the previous instalments he had such an intimidating and foreboding presence whereas here, although he tries, it is impossible to take his character seriously and while he is certainly the most accomplished actor amongst the group his talents are wasted with a completely worthless script featuring some of the worst sustained dialogue it has been my displeasure to have ever heard.
while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies,i didn't' like this third and(so far Final)installment.i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much.there's a lot of filler here,which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie.i also wasn't too impressed with the acting.there was a lot of overwrought theatrics.as well,there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies,basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore.maybe i'm just imagining things,but this is my opinion on things.finally,this movie has none of the style of the second movie.adding it all up,this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts.my vote for Candyman 3:Day of the dead is a 3/10
No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame.
This film was sadly typical and even for a horror movie it was plain pathetic, I do like a little cheesiness every once in a while, but for a great story like Candyman, this was really sad.
When reading the pages, I flew smoothly through the pages, feeling shocked, anticipating, interested, while the film just left me feeling vaguely sick.
You can see his anger for Jed but in some scenes it looks like he loses it for no reason at all...while these are the signs of a desperate man there isn't enough ammunition to react in that way and so the viewer feels confused.
On the surface, Claire has more in common with Jed's character; while obviously disturbed, Jed wholly embraces his emotions, regardless of how inappropriate they are.
Craig puts in another wide-ranging performance, while Morton, never less than awe-inspiring, is flawless.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs   One day,novelist and science lecturer Joe (Daniel Craig) takes his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) out for a picnic in the beautiful English countryside.He has an ulterior motive-he means to propose to her.But then,suddenly and completely without warning,their lives are changed irrevocably forever when a red hot air balloon falls from the sky and a desperate struggle ensues to save the people on board.A man is killed and Joe is plagued with feelings of guilt and failure for sometime after.After a while,he does his best to put the incident behind him and move on with his life.But there's one person for whom doing that obviously hasn't been so easy for-fellow rescuer Jed (Rhys Ifans) who begins obsessively following Joe everywhere,leading him down a nightmare path of fear and madness.
I don't think this is necessarily the fault of the actors: while they are unable to kickstart the film into something resembling life, Daniel Craig and Samantha Morton nevertheless bring intensity and integrity to their roles as Joe and Claire.
The first highly unusual aspect is that it begins as a quirky "art-house drama" from which emerges a surreal, tragic event in the opening, and which gradually transforms into a thriller ala Brian De Palma, all while keeping one foot firmly planted in the art-house drama arena.
Perhaps he had fallen asleep while directing this piece.
Her character (the wife's) is the most compelling, very well acted by Phyllis Kirk, as she fights and does everything she can to save her man, in one scene holding his hand down so he can't answer the ringing black telephone, while we hear her begging him not to answer.
This is not meant to suggest that professional actors should work for peanuts...suffice it to say that, while "Saving Star Wars" (http://www.savingstarwars.com ) is clearly (and correctly, I believe) critical of the parts of the second trilogy that were then (2003) known, it is a lovingly critical work.
Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future.
While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them.
Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two.
Ghost World is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while.
What happens to Seymour in the end is dealt with a heavier dose of comedy than perhaps would have been necessary, while Enid's future is more poetically left open-ended.
Anything that falls below their radar, you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand, while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.
Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life, while Enid lives by the day, following one infatuation after another.
Kate and Sayid are captured while trying to rescue Jack, but John Locke escapes and finds Ben Linus trapped on his bed.
Rupert Everett, while no Jeremy Brett, is a very good Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes says this while studying the corpse of a young woman...a girl, really, born of a wealthy, aristocratic family who had gone missing.
Surely you knew that," she says to Holmes while she, Watson and Homes are at dinner.
Perhaps while they're gone he'll encounter Irene Adler.
And while we're on the subject, I found myself constantly baffled by the sudden appearances of police fingerprints, phones, and physical violence in the cells.
Nelson is convincing enough as the bitter ex-con caught in the middle that it's a shame that the former dancer didn't go on to anything more interesting than directing some of Elvis' worst movies, Phyllis Kirk makes more of an impression as his wife than the script would lead you to expect while Jay Novello makes a big impact as a drunken horse doctor who hates people but loves dogs and has no scruples about rifling a corpse's pockets for services not rendered.
The foreman comes out and has them play like a symphony while building!
TCM shows this every once in a while and their print is in pristine shape.
One thing I would say is that if I were a sixteen year old girl or so, this would be my favourite film for a good while because of the 'girl-on-girl action'.
Throughout the rest of the film Captain America loses in a fist fight with Red Skull, gets tied to a rocket, fakes car sickness to steal his friends' vehicles, learns about world history he missed while he was frozen for 5 decades, flees from henchmen, hides, and lays low.
Over while the beginning and ending of the film show flashes of what this film should have been like the incredibly boring middle of the film and the lame plot make this one of the few films I feel really deserve a "1".
It takes a while before we understand what the hell this has to do with anything - no, it's not a scene from "The Godfather" which was accidentally spliced into the film during production - because we quickly cut to:  SEVEN YEARS LATER   (as an afterthought) 1943  World War II is running full throttle and dazed-looking Steve is mugging his way through a tearful farewell to his family and girlfriend, Bernie (and here I was thinking this was a guy's name!).
This film is fun if you like seeing a guy in a bad costume run around and throw a shield, while a man who looks and acts like Jimmy Carter is a crime-fighting president (and protector of the environment).
Sure its not like the current Marvel movies but this was made a long while ago.
Sterling Hayden is, as usual, excellent, while a very young Charles Bronson is surprisingly good as a 'punk' hood.
In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.
They really do wreck the engine while filming one sequence, & it sat on the lot where it was wrecked until WW 2 when it was salvaged for scrap iron.
One night while visiting his cousins Louis nightclub, he witnesses a man getting shot, which becomes a catalyst for his downfall.
By the way, while all is practically perfect in every way about this film, this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film.
Along the way are many comic classic moments, such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train, or when (at a moment of dejection) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions.
Most importantly, the area had stretches of parallel tracks, which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainÂagilely scrambling over the cars, balancing on the roof to scan the horizon, chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himÂto be filmed from another train running alongside.
Buster, his train, and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him.
Johnnie's dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers.
The plot alone is entertaining, however the obvious draw of the film is Buster Keaton's amazing stunts, including the famous (and dangerous) scenes of him riding in front of a moving train while attempting to dislodge large wooden planks that are blocking the tracks in front of him.
Another commenter said that this comedy is much better than those which came in the talking pictures period, and while I don't agree with that (The Thin Man series are some of the greatest "dialogue comedies") I would certainly not call the man a liar.
Then a chick I met while I was under the stage took a picture of me shaking her hand.
I kept rubbing my hands wondering what their set list was going to be while I played their live LP Under A Blood Red Sky to death , I was really hoping they were going to perform I Will Follow .
Artists went out of their way to give a concert while people went out of their way to put their hands in their pockets .
It seems junior (Edmund Purdom) got the hots for the high priestess of Astati (Lana Turner) while incurring the wrath of the high priest of Baal and tyrant of Damascus (Louis Calhern) and frittered away his fortune before coming to his senses and leading the people in rebellion against their pagan oppressors.
The flogging he suffers while chained in a dungeon in "The Prodigal" did, however, win him a bit of unexpected honor.
And the story itself, about outlaws on the run with Lynda willingly going along for the ride, is pretty exciting in a trashy kind of way for a while but then gets too repetitiously redundant by the end.
Something to watch with half an eye while going through the paperwork.
A friend of mine recommended Rob Gunnerson's ARC to me a while ago.
Now while the cinematography is what originally lured me in to the film, it was the character driven story lines and superb acting that kept me on the edge of my seat.
I kept watching how they had framed each shot and how they would do those angles where one person is in the forground facing the camera with an expression on their face while the other person is off in the background waiting for the foreground person to turn back around.
The image of the older cousin in those then-hip now-hideous, calf length athletic socks... That image alone made this film worth while.
Wolfgang MÃ¼ller (River Phoenix) is the intelligent creator of complex things, Ben Crandall (Ethan Hawke) is the dreamer but his intelligence is not to be underestimated and Darren Woods (Jason Presson) is a normal, but a bit lonely, kid who happened to stumble into Ben's life and sees the opportunity to 'escape' from or rather to forget his problems at home for a while.
Great documentaries can have social messages and come to conclusions about society (Bowling for Columbine, Fog of War) while others are great but on a much simpler and human level (Spellbound, Winged Migration).
Hooper manages the neat trick of paying homage to the slasher tradition that he himself launched so long ago with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" while also adding some dimension and wit to the proceedings by virtue of a nicely detailed Hollywood urban legend angle.
"Toolbox Murders", while being interpreted as a "remake" of an earlier film with the same name, is given a powerful upgrade and the story shines thanks to the duties of fright master Tobe Hooper.
She plays a would be schoolteacher who moves into the strange old building while her husband completes his medical residency.
Hooper stated that in going through old papers from CHAINSAW's production he found that they only purchased 1.5 ounces of stage blood, while the remake probably bought it in gallon tanks.
Some of the gruesomely vicious scenes are almost impossible to forget and seeing a masked maniac use a nail gun to slaughter a naked teenager while he merrily hums away like he's changing a light bulb is a shock tactic has never been used as effectively since.
Then there's the intermixture of serious things and humorous things: such as Tarzan disarming the men; while Cheetah disarms the Kleenex box of Kleenex, one sheet at a time.
At State College, while most of the young men are more interested in "free love" than marriage, handsome Michael aka "Mike" (Richard Cromwell, an exact cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jude Law) is full of old-fashioned ideals and he loves to get advice and talk things over with his favorite "Prof", a real sort of mentor to our young heartthrob.
You'll love the comic in France when Aune enter a coffee shop, randomly running into a former girlfriend, while wearing Rollerblades.
The film is set up as a series of flashbacks while Linda is coping with breast cancer in the 1990s, so the ultimate doom of Linda kind of puts a downer on the whole movie.
A nice film to have on in the background while you're busy doing other things.
When Lennon was killed, J&P were on semi-decent terms -- they hadn't talked for a while, but not because of any big feud.
In Phantom Raiders Nick Carter answers the duty call while on vacation and is sent to Panama to investigate the mysterious sinking of several cargo ships near the Panama coast where he is joined by his eccentric assistant Bartholomew who as usually provides sometimes a valuable help and on other occasions creates havoc though always remaining handy.
The camera angle was mildly interesting for a while.
Also, some of the camera angles were interesting at first, but as the plot and the overall content of the film left much to be desired, the angles began to really get on my nerves after a while.
Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times.
One day while driving in town, she sees her husband (Dennis Quaid) kissing a pretty woman in a red dress outside his office building.
Sedgewick can only offer her own withering scorn to her parents (she lives in a house on her father's farm with no visible means of support and therefore is beholden to her parents), while she clucks sympathetically with her sister.
It's been a while since I experienced in the movies, a mother's love for her young child, and vice versa, being the primary focus of the film, especially with one that dealt with distance and longing.
Nine-year-old Carlitos lives with his grandmother in Mexico while his mother struggles to make ends meet in Los Angeles.
So the mother goes to America, while the kid is in Mexico with his grandmother.
Its significance is found in its simplicity Â while our heart strings are being tugged, our eyes are also being opened.
While Rosario's daily renunciation is a testament to conviction and hope, Carlito's mission to make his way from Mexico to L.A. gives the film a heartbreaking tenderness while still tersely telling the truth of his tale.
I know an institutionalized schizophrenic who shows the usual flat affect but who, every once in a while, begins to sing "I Won't Dance" in a peppy tempo.
The whole while both Barney and Vinnie loose their wives to other people.
For example, the phony minister, the jump-starting cars in the army, 25 copies of one book just in case he wants to read it more than once, he put a stolen fish in his trunk while the weather was cold because there wasn't enough room in his freezer on account of another guy he knew gave him a side of beef, etc.
The fed assigned him Barney Coopersmith(Rick Moranis,mensch)seems to be woefully unable to keep a leash on his charge,but it's alright because while Vinnie may not sit still in protective custody,he's got a big heart for those around him keeping him out of prison.
Naturally,while Vinnie may not be always above board about his actions,he's still pretty good on his word and intentions.
WHat made it worth while to watch is the great chemistry between the three leads.
Moranis has it tougher while trying to be a nerd/FBI agent(unusual combo) but he pulls it off.
Woody Allen did all but direct this film, which is why it sometimes misses lists of his best films, the truth is he had moved on to another project while it was still a stage show, and such is his desire to create, he didn't want to go back too directing.
Because his apartment is a shrine to all things Humphrey Bogart (the movie begins with Allan at an art-house movie theatre at the end of CASABLANCA), it's no surprise when Bogart makes his own appearance and gives Allan pointers about how to react to women while telling him what went wrong.
Dick who suspects that his wife Linda had been having an affair while he was away on business goes into the same kind of depressed state of mind like his friend Allen.
Keaton is a terrific foil for Allen, both platonically and as it turns out, otherwise, while Tony Roberts as her husband (this being his first of many Allen films, too) makes for a wry straight man with his constant phone calls and his appearances in some fun fantasy send-ups, the best of them in Italian.
Credit should also be given to Ross for bringing Allen's picture-perfect screenplay to life and also to cinematographer Owen Roizman for capturing the picturesque San Francisco locations while evoking classic Hollywood in key scenes.
There's seamless choreography in some scenes involving Woody's imagined interplay with Bogart while "real" characters converse with Woody.
Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce.
While his films often have something wrong with them, you can always count on a good time and a laugh while you're watching - and that's certainly what you get here!
The plot of the movie plays out like a tribute to Casablanca, and it sees recently dumped Allen falling in love with his best friend's wife, all the while under the watchful eye of the great Humphrey Bogart, whom he sees in his daydreams.
When Sam is annoyed that John never told him that he was proud or him, or thinking of him while he was away, Dean just quietly remarks that "The phones work both ways, Sam."
First of all, I'm going to assume that a long time passed while they were in the attic, hiding from the bugs.
And while you might think this is regular slasher fare, I say nay!
What we have here is a series of slasher murders being investigated by a very angry cop, he's been on leave for a while since his daughter got killed and now he's back and he uses lots of 4-letter words and goes right into ballistic without even working up to it, whew!
Elaborate caper movie which, while nothing special, is redeemed by its unusual Israeli setting.
After a while I forgot about it, until last night, it was on again (the satellite had been fixed by then).
This little gem happened to be one of the good ones, the editing, the music, the relationship between the two main characters made this film one of the most entertaining films I'd seen for a while.
Too bad he's only in it for a short while.
He gets dumped by his girlfriend while delivering a pizza and when he parks his bike to make the delivery someone steals it.
Some of the material was clearly put there merely to be controversial, to tick off the censors and/or otherwise provoke, and while there are points where you can definitely tell that PhD's wrote this, there certainly are also ones where it doesn't feel like that at all.
Looking at all the nominations and wins the series received while on the air with FOX just proves how dumb FOX was to cancel the show.
He believably pulls off being shrewd in business, but naive enough of his personal life to be almost innocent while looking completely guilty.
instead, the film indulges in the American atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib, while sympathizing with those who were jailed.
The plot threads start to feel unwieldy after a while, but journeyman director William A. Seiter is smart enough to know when to include the musical interludes.
Little-remembered Claire Dodd predictably plays Jack's slithery fiancÃ©e Sophie, while character actress Helen Westley plays Minnie with her amusing gruffness intact (she was to reunite with Dunne the next year in James Whale's classic version of "Showboat").
The film offers no easy answers as to exactly why the events at Abu Ghraib unfolded as they did; yet, while it doesn't turn the individuals involved into easy-to-blame villains, it doesn't completely exonerate them either.
But the documentary makes it quite clear that only low-level soldiers were ever sentenced while it was evident that their antics were known and passed over by higher level people.
He introduces fake basement-tape video reenactments (a device he has used before) to augment the visuals of the Abu Ghraib abuses--close-ups of "prisoners'" bodies, blood dripping on a uniform, keys going into a lock--so that after a while you aren't sure what is real and what is fake.
Although the film starts of blissfully stupid enough, with Lorenzo Lamas pretending to be a robber, while another guy robs some place.
Playing a doctor, Dr. Royce Lee Stockman, Elissa Landi, once a beauty, brought some depth to the story of a woman who traveled to the Philippines to marry one doctor while carrying a bright torch for another, an army medico named Michael who just happened to be stationed in the territory.
In any event, history takes its course and Corregidor falls but not before some of the women, including Royce are flown out (in reality, American army nurses were captured by the Japanese and while they were spared the horrors of the Bataan Death March, they didn't exactly have a nice time for the next three years either).
Or something...end up being in space while nuclear war happens on earth, only to crash-land on earth sometime later...not MUCH later, but society seems to have changed rather quickly and gotten that dirty Mad Max Punk Rocker type look to it.
The story itself deals with a band of cutthroats, thieves and smugglers on the Cornish Coast of England, while the dark and moody atmosphere of the picture gives it the feel of a pirate film that mostly takes place on land.
It was after a night of drinking and fighting with his best friend Bob Herrick, William Bishop, and while barley sober marrying a complete stranger Lorry Reed, Gloria McGhehee, that Brady finally came to his senses.
In the days before social welfare became a responsibility of government, these bosses while they enriched themselves also fed a lot of hungry people, giving them food and fuel for a winter.
Another interesting parallel between the film and actual history is that Harry S. Truman was sponsored by Tom Pendergast and managed to keep himself personally clean and advance his political career while remaining loyal to the Machine.
The battle at the end between the two Deoxys and Rayqueza while Ash tries to shut down the security droids is very suspenseful.
The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.
The starting fight between the alien poke and the earth one was cool, showing off the aliens strength for a little while.
Here's Douglas looking suave and rotten rich while Paltrow has that lost waif look of hers that has its place but not here.
For example, studio executives use creative accounting to allow the non-union Jitlov to make his short while remaining out of union sight.
A Perfect Murder is an update of the Hitchcock classic 'Dial M For Murder', and while the film doesn't touch Hitchcock's in terms of how thrilling it is, this update has been well handled and despite losing things such as the claustrophobia and the tight plot, A Perfect Murder still does what you'd expect it to do.
Next, was when Diderot got a boner when seeing Madame Therbouche (Fanny Ardant) while she was painting a portrait of him naked. "
The film cleverly and clearly explains many aspects of why the world is in trouble while allowing that we do still have time to stop the worst happening IF WE CHANGE NOW.
The soundtrack and the visual style is interesting too, so it helps you relax a little while being shocked.
Wizard makes fun of the film industry's obnoxious red tape and the heartlessness of money-grubbing studio executives, while highlighting the generous spirit of friends and of directors who want what's good for a film but have their hands tied by the stuffy studio.
This meant the dramas (psychological/psychical) while there (and this is a fairly laborious and talkative film confronting the issues of war and politics), were never overdone or overly milked, but still having enough kick to leave an impression.
The story is told in a very entertaining and well-paced fashion while sustaining a feeling of tension.
It's really worth your while and I hope when people see it in a video store they'll consider giving it a chance.
The mother finally escapes from the basement, captured in a beautifully executed shot of the former matriarch, now a savage beast, tinted red in the foreground while her stern-looking portrait looms in the background.
The entire film is tinged with sadness and loss, and ends with not just a mob of angry villagers, but an entire Catholic parade, all brandishing torches while praying to gaudy statues of Mama Mary.
Hardy, while a friend of Wayne, had only worked 'solo' once in a feature film in over twenty years (1939's "Zenobia"), and it took a LOT of coaxing (and Stan Laurel's 'blessing'), to get him to accept the role...and what a pleasure he is, to watch!
My favorite one liner in The Fighting Kentuckian is the one where John Breen (John Wayne), after being shot while surveying, comes to a cabin of French settlers, and is discovered by the men who shoot him.
while the action scenes are not a total loss, they could have been a lot better.
It took all my strength to actually see it through to the end all the while hoping that something redeeming would happen.
Samantha Mathis, while attempting to be the leading action lady in a few parts, suffers from a nervous breakdown.
It is soon left to Hale and an impossibly cute Park Ranger by the name of Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis)to recover the warheads and make them safe, while Travolta's evil plan begins to take shape.
Director Woo knows how to turn in a decent action flick & he doesn't disappoint here, while the unmistakable style of his earlier Hong Kong films may have been slightly sterilised by Hollywood the set-pieces in his films still remain very impressive.
Oh well, I suppose it gave some actors a little work for a while...
They actually take a good portion of the film while not offering anything else in return.
It starts with a bad guy pulling out his gun, the lead actor hearing it and spinning around while pulling his gun out, somehow a Geo Metro approaching from out of frame at 5 miles per hour 'crashes' in to the bad guy, which of course shatters the windshield.
Some people will tire easily of these, while others will wonder where this gem has been hiding.
Those who enjoy the eye-candy will constantly wonder how Mike did all of those special effects, while those who know this answer will be amazed at his patience.
***  I haven't had this much fun for a while!
This resurrects Barnabas Collins (Ben Cross) a vampire and he proceeds to attack the Collins family while romancing Victoria who is the resurrection of his dead fiancÃ©e.
And, we have someone, who is a big game hunting enthusiast, who also helps keep the local population of strippers & prostitutes down by taking them out to the wilds in his airplane, stripping them, and giving them a head start while he tracks them down & kills them.
Not sure if this will qualify as a spoiler, but not going to take any chances: Story takes a little while to get going, but once the hunt is on, things really take off.
And if you do ... Then you get to set back, relax and watch the cops try to figure it out while essentially being lead around by the hand by those ( like you ) who know.
Very good "Old Dark House" type mystery, with a lot of similarities to The Cat and the Canary, with the young woman inheriting everything while all other members are shut out.
One thing I realized while watching this film, a lot of the classic comedies are founded on good witty dialogue.
If you're watching this on video, you'll probably have to rewind several times to catch the jokes you missed while you were laughing.
Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview?
While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing.
Well another talented human gets chucked on the pile, while Kevin Costner roams free to make movies as he pleases.
This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.
This is a frenetic comedy, and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious, this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot, though it drives the main story.
After hearing his voice from outside the window while conducting his chorus in rehearsal, Mr. Parry (Edward Chapman) manages to convince David to sing in his choir and gets him a job at the mines where he also works.
It was also one of the best movies I have seen in a while.
No hot guys, while there are plenty good looking girls, most of all are the "slutty" type, and there a few scenes in a strip club, so there's lots of female nudity and stripping, which they also added in unappropriate parts of the movie.
About a year ago, my sister and her husband, while i was over visiting, pulled a video out of their shelf and asked if I'd ever seen this.
The fact that Brandon's character was half insane while Eric's was totally sane simply wasn't an advantage for Brandon.
But while Brandon Lee was definitely handsome, charming and a good martial artist, he just wasn't all that good an actor.
And at least her character isn't a total damsel in distress as, while Ward's chief villain snatched her twice, it wasn't really her fault.
And while I've seen Dale Midkiff and Bruce McCarthy in other films and I know them to be decent actors, they just don't have anything to do here besides being typical 1-dimentional villains (ie, needlessly violent, remorseless, having no positive aspects at all to them and good only when dead).
Alex, unlike Ashe from the second film, has fun with his victims while he tortures/kills them.
Recep helps a watermelon vendor, while Mehmet works with a barber.
In the East myths still can have very real appearances, and there are many many daily moments to spend enjoying the simple blessings of God while waving off the flies in the hot air, chatting with your watermelon customers, or taking a nap!
One day we realise it has been gone for some time already, while we had still so much more plans and business to do with it...!
So, while the footage would roll on the right, you would see a modern-day Chuck Berry singing in concert.
Frank and Joe are assisted by Joe's girlfriend Iola (Carole Ann Campbell) and hindered by their Aunt Gertrude who is looking after them while their father is out of town.
After mucking about for the first hour, confusing all but those who either have an obsessive love of Cam'ron or this film genre, you find out he has a girlfriend (he didn't really have a love interest for the first half of the film) so he drops his pants and does the "look at my ass while I pretend to have sex" love scene that was reminiscent of DMX's scene in "Belly".
But everyone gives inspired and interesting performances while just playing themselves.
This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.
So while 'American Graffiti' strives to illuminate Curtis' decision on whether to take that adventure and ship off to college, to engage in that world where he is in control the irony is that he already inhabits that wonderful place.
Steve lent Terry the Toad his car for safe keeping while he's out of town.
Its hard to view this movie 20-20 given the widely viewed subsequent series Happy Days which, while excellent, lacked the excitement and charm offered in the film.
Time is a speeding train.We must embrace the good times of our life,particularly those of our youth,while we have them,because they are gone before we know it.This is the lesson I get while watching American Graffiti.This is not just a classic film with featuring a heavyweight Hollywood line up in their youth,it is one of the ultimate lessons of life.Times change,people change,and those changes take place with a lightning fast speed that we never seem to see coming.We owe George Lucas and everyone involved in the making of this film a great deal of gratitude for teaching us this.Also,who doesn't fall in love with Suzanne Somers while watching this.We see her only for a moment,but that's all it takes.WOW!
The film lacks a straight plot in the conventional sense, it just cruises along, relaxes, and then cruises some more, as do the characters: sensitive Curt has to decide whether he is the competitive type (and runs into a street gang while he's at it), All-American Steve contemplates life with or without his girlfriend, dragster John manages to breach some of his untouchable daredevil image by baby-sitting the twerpy Carol, and Terry the Toad finally gets himself a girl (and what a girl she is).
We needed to go cruising for girls (or boys) while listening to Wolfman Jack crank out rock & roll classics.
The eventful night when freshly graduated high school friends contemplated their futures while immersed in small town America's car-hops, drive-in movies & doo-wop music (the soundtrack is one of the best featured in ANY film!
Ron Howard and Cindy Williams get some practice for their soon to follow "Happy Days", while Charles Martin Smith and Candy Clark are wonderful as the goofus who wants to show a pretty girl a good time.
"Democratic" capitalist society has become a tyrannical system run by corporations who enslave us for profit, while we, the average consumer, are barely aware of the golden cage in which we live.
Unlike in "Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei" you could find many things to criticize here - while the comparison to that last movie can hardly be avoided.
The rather negative way in which the TV executives appear might even be called too optimistic - while in the movie they seem just to be immoral and very well knowing what they do, reality might look somewhat worse: Most of the people in charge are probably acting in accordance to their very own moral principles.
But this film doesn't apologize for the stereotypes or anything, while some of the characters are apologetic about many things in their own lives.
My brother always said "every good director will make a bad movie, and every once in a while a bad director might make a good movie" but I never expected something halfway this decent to come from Shyamalan.
It had a great story line, was well acted and had a strong message while being poignant and humorous.
This mission could take days...'  Told with warmth and humour -- under the beautiful direction of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan -- this film explores life's universal questions by gently pushing the boundaries while remaining safe at the same time.
the story of young Joshua questioning life while everyone, including his best friend, parents, and teachers scoff at him is heartbreaking.
while searching for the answers of his initial question he sees life they way it should be seen.
the thing i love most about m. night is the "FEELING" you get while watching his movies.
In Six Sense we have two stars Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, while in "Birth "we have Nicole Kidman and Cameron Bright ( who is actually a pretty good actor judging by his filmography ) .
The climax is the Battle of Bromley End, with British Home Guard troops arriving while the Germans, attacking the manor house where they must set up their equipment, are held off by the brave men and women of the village.
This movie, while entertaining, is your typical cinematic horror movie just like the previous Texas Chainsaw.
And while House of a 1000 corpses didn't make me scared for my life it definitely captured that 70s vibe and quality that is missed by so many of these films.
It's a mixture of capability - some utterly useless and cowardly, while others, like Chrissie (Jordana Brewster, she's hawt!)
Especially of note in the cast is Jordana Brewster, who beyond being devastatingly beautiful, is really outstanding in the role of the major female heroine Â convincingly and movingly portraying the terror and the resilience of an innocent girl struggling to survive while confronted with unimaginable horrors and witnessing the brutality done to her closest friends.
In August, 1939, a worker has an abortion while working in a slaughterhouse and dies.
The Vietnam War is cynically exploited to analogize two characters "coming of age" and "becoming men" while suffering the torments of the savage Hewitt clan (also given an un-ironic layer in R. Lee Ermey's war veteranship).
'Irony,' in this case, would be knowing that "High Tension" was threatened with an NC-17 while this geek show passed through the ever-astute MPAA with an easy R. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" shook my soul with rageÂa truly vile, worthless bit of cinema with no redeeming qualities.
Playing an intricate game of cat and mouse, Pacino tries to learn her true nature all the while combatting his own desires to possess her for himself.
He's on a case regarding a swinger who was shot in the back of the head while listening to an oldie record 45 titled, "sea of Love".
The break seems to have done Pacino good Â he is absolutely riveting in this film, oozing charisma on the one hand, while sharing a very real sexual chemistry with his co-star Ellen Barkin on the other.
Pacino registers brilliantly as the tormented hero, while Barkin is thoroughly convincing as the sexpot whose beauty and allure are enough to make a man risk his life for them.
In fact, he handed in one of the most convincing performances I've seen from a child actor in a very long while, because 99% of the time, the children of celebrities are precocious, annoying and predictable.
All in all, the film depicts realistic scenarios laced with many humorous parts - all the while featuring "Hell's Kitchen" as the backdrop.
This Mr. Reincarnation was accurate down to the smallest details of how his actions should be as an adult while also displaying how his vehicle was still that of a child's.
One day he makes eye contact with Renata, a girl from an upper class family, while at a trendy mall.
I went to Calcutta in 1999 and people still ride on human rickshaws (a person runs barefoot on streets while pulling the rickshaws for few cents).
The farmers were gullible while the land owner, money lender and the Brahmins were guile.
A heart warming and funny, bitter-sweet story with high-octane entertainment; Shouf Shouf Habibi enriches the viewer with insight into the struggle of a traditional Moroccan family trying to integrate into Dutch society, while maintaining their "identity" as well.
Far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made?
The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script.
You are constantly thinking while you experience this film, and you are never sure of the answers.
For a while now, I've been trying to find Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Korei (aka.
Not a bad little Japanese horror flick, this, but while it is creepy and disturbing I must say that I felt rather lost trying to keep up with or figure out what was going on.
a horror film hasn't given me chills in a while.
The pacing wears and the logic, while frightening gets stretched almost to the breaking point.
Its one of the best I've seen in a while.
All in all a FANTASTIC piece of work, and one of my favourite episodes... and while I'm here can i just add how much i loved that blood splatter on the camera when SAM blew up :D Xsarahx
Meanwhile Ellen tells Dean where his brother is, while Sam is hunted by Gordon.
Richard Harris here contends with probably the weakest role of his career (it's NOT his worst film, but certainly his most bored and subdued performance ever), while supporting stalwarts like Ray Milland, Sven Bertil Taube and Denholm Elliott are wasted too.
James Fargo directs rather lethargically, making the plot unbearably hard-to-follow on the one hand while over-simplifying the racial themes on the other.
Save your time or else keep heavy things out reach while watching it because you will want to destroy the TV.
What sets this combat film apart, aside from its infantry perspective, is the appearance of two genuine Sherman tanks--which while they may not be the same models that plowed through the fields of France--are a rarity in World War II movies, especially during the 1950s.
I didn't have high pre-expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised while watching this enjoyable film.
Most of the other actors fit blandly into their goofy patterned innocent/naive American farmboy roles, and it wears thin after a while.
All the while the tank was burning and could have exploded at any time.
He brings him home and while there's something eerily familiar to Claudette he becomes an adjunct family member.
As such a controversial figure, reviewers and film critics everywhere are completely unable to part with their own convictions while reviewing this work of art, as audiences are while (not) watching it.
Obviously, a Spanish-only film will be unappealing to anyone uncomfortable with subtitles, while other-language speakers will rely too heavily on those subtitles and be forced to miss any continuity in Soderbergh's disruptive time-shifts.
Part1 is particularly offensive at this, because he leaves out far more story than he includes, and because he contextualizes events so poorly while intruding his "edgy" style of flashbacks and flash-forwards.
Prior to the final version's English voice-overs re-recorded by Benicio (helpfully less irritating than dubbing), Part1 presented unnecessary impediments, such as the fearfully episodic nature of Soderbergh's scenes, the lack of audience preparation (preamble) for things that are about to happen, while any chosen events are so minimally and Latino-centrically portrayed, that we really do feel like Eddie Murphy.
David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) correctly observed that Part1 is "uneven" (and HOW), while Part2 "goes rapidly downhill" from there, charting Che's final campaign in Bolivia "in excruciating detail".
Soderbergh completes his canonization by closing Part One with the victorious Che 200 miles out of Havana and for good reason since it would be difficult for his lead to maintain an ethereal demeanor while ordering mass executions without trial.
This is interspersed with excerpts from an interview Che gives while visiting the the UN after the revolution and from his speech to the UN general assembly.
The film begins and we move from one place to another, we will keep seeing NY while we see the revolutionary road.
Certainly we see how Che was, many people wanted to join him, the ones who knew how to read and how to write came first, the other ones while not in combat must learn.
To sit and watch this, you are asked to sit in with history being made through characters while the political world stands hidden beyond the trees or stated passive-aggressively in UN meetings.
In the end, though, while the visuals are gorgeous and the acting superb, it is the story that leaves a little something to be desired.
Soderbergh seems to have crafted the tale he wanted to, only allowing us to see what he deems important, while leaving all other details by the wayside.
So like most of those that have come before it, Che is a movie that is best appreciated under no pretence; this is a history lesson disguised as film, and while it does tell a good story, those looking for entertainment best look away.
No, instead the movie tells the facts as they were, straight from the horses mouth, and while they can sometimes work against the common desires of cinema goers' need for personal fulfillment, if digested objectively, can provide a strongly engaging, interesting and informative piece of historically significant art.
Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes.
In one scene, a thug batters the truth out of an unwilling victim while we watch Curly ride around in a circle.
For example, in an early scene the camera focuses on Jack Palance's nonchalant mannerisms while his henchman is killing a man off screen.
However, while certainly lighthearted in comparison with Corbucci's DJANGO (1966; which I should revisit again in a couple of days) and especially THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), it's a more balanced proposition than COMPANEROS (particularly with respect to Palance's performance - quietly menacing here as opposed to the campiness of the later film) and, thus, superior to it in practically every way.
The story starts with Nero establishing his badassness while catching a dice cheat, forcing the gambler to eat the dice and saying, "When you get them back, I suggest you dont use them again."
(To give a good example, at one point, while crossing the desert, Nero makes Paco and the revolutionaries empty their canteens so he can have a shower while they go thirsty.)
Aside from nice bits of humor, it sports some religious allusions, such as, Paco begins with only twelve men + Nero (their Jesus), they masquerade at one point during a religious parade and attack while dressed as angels and virgin Mary's, as well as Nero being strapped to a t-shaped cross when captured.
The show makes you feel sorry for the Communists as Chiang Kai shek went around persecuting them while Japan was fighting a war with China.
It's originally a rough road as Buttermaker is more concerned with drinking beer, while the kids themselves don't know which end of the bat to hold.
Displaying the same wise-ass mien that won her an Oscar three years earlier (with more generous outpourings of profanity), she more than holds her own against the veteran Matthau, even teaching his character a lesson or two about team spirit and sportsmanship, while evoking sympathy on her own as she is forced to confront more personal, off-the-field problems.
Vic Morrow shows off his formidable macho as the typically underhanded opposing coach, while Brandon ("The Courtship of Eddie's Father") Cruz, who plays Morrow's star pitcher son, has a nifty, poignant scene as a kid who finally stands up to his father's belittling bully act.
The movie is about an alcoholic low key unfriendly pool cleaner named Morris Buttermaker who is payed to coach a team of little leaguers after one of the kid's Dad sued the league for the right to play, the team is of course a team of underdogs, the kind of kids who you wouldn't want playing on your team in gym class; with Toby: The Nice guy who's gonna finish last Lupous, the shy one Tanner, the short- tempered, overbearing, runt Ahmad, the token black kid Engleberg, the fat kid Rudi Stein, the uncoordinated awkward guy Ogilvy, the smart one Jimmy, the curly top Jose and Miguel, the foreigners and Regi, the redhead with an overbearing sports Dad One thing I liked the best is that they give each kid a reasonable amount of screen time, some (Amanda, Kelly, Tanner,)more than others, but each a good amount, so you can know each member all pretty well, unlike most sports movies, where you only get to know a couple players, while the rest are pretty much extra's.
Butterworth shows a mean opportunism that the kids resent on his team, while Turner manages to permanently louse up his relationship with his son and wife by humiliating the boy for not following his orders.
A while back, I bought a multi-pack of exploitation films (oddly misnamed "cult films") and this was one of twenty films in the set.
One day while speaking with a friend, he mentioned he had found a working PS1 emulator for the PC.
I found myself being educated while riding the emotional roller coaster of those events as marriage equality was advanced and people were educated.
I was in Boston while that was all happening, and I'm kicking myself now for not participating in any of the rallies.
I also have a problem with the all-or-nothing ending: David's mom surely should have found a way to see him daily, while allowing him the advantages that trained professionals could offer.
As a fan of this franchise and thinking that I knew everything about it, I have learned many things while watching it.
Starts out with plenty of action and suspense as Mr. Big (Preston Foster) hires four ex-cons to help him in a big bank heist, while putting the frame-up on another ex-con, a deliveryman for the florist down the block from the bank.
(He's framed while driving a truck full of posies - probably the most unlikely guy to be framed for a bank job.)
Good guy John Payne musters considerable credibility as the flawed protagonist who is punished for the crime, while a dream cast of classic heavies--Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, and Neville BrandÂenjoy their ill-gotten gains until our hero can pay them back with interest.
Rowland Brown and Harold Bruce provided the basis for the story, while Harry Essex and George Bruce penned the tightly-knit screenplay with uncredited assistance from both Karlson and Payne.
One scene in particular lets us see some guys getting onto a boat while we could still watch a nice old Mercury woody wagon and its occupant in the background.
John Payne plays the put-upon leading role in his usual keyed up, hyper-virile manner, and while I would not call him a charming actor, he was capable in the kind of modest tale.
And playing behind it all is Metallica's Master of Puppets, first the quiet intro - leading into the various movements while the sun glints through the knotted mass of arms.
I'm sure most fans of heavy metal can attest to being faced with similar challenges while growing up, and it was good to see that I am not alone.
The heavy metal, "tree," is a really cool thing, and while I hate the fact that too many discussions surrounding heavy metal spiral downward into arguments over what sub-genre a certain band does or doesn't fall into, it's a really well thought out visual aid to the film.
Unlike 1988' The Decline II: "The Metal Years" disaster while a big deal at the time, it still remains a brutal "cringe-fest" from start to finish and focused on predominately one style (Glam)one era (The 80s) one location(Sunset Strip) and barely covers the period of Heavy Metal that is STILL alive and well: thrash, black, speed,etc   I would have never guessed that a film about Heavy Metal would take serious the attitudes, styles, individuals,genres and provide a clear history time-line unlike Decline and any others of that ilk.
Personalities like Alice Cooper, Bruce Dickinson, Alex Webster, Slipknot, Ghaal, Dee Snider, Doro, Ihsahn and many others offer their own individual thoughts in an intellectual way while bands like Mayhem make a fool out of themselves during a drunken interview.
Hollywood can be a cruel place & Peter's attempts to build a movie career - he worked for a while as Porky Pig's stunt double - proved a failure.
Martin narrowly escapes a raid on their apartment and flees to Canada, while Cosmo goes down.
The characters are all terrific and among the most realistic seen in "high-tech" thrillers of this nature, while also adding a certain light-hearted feel at times.
So while I have reservations, I do recommend Sneakers.
As my fiancÃ©e pointed out while we watched it, fans of J.J. Abrams' hit series Alias will appreciate the elaborate planning and execution of the "sneaks"(though it is not as stylized), and there is some gadgetry.
The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop.
I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next.
But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them.
But neither of those Cold War films are relevant today, while SNEAKERS still is.
The special effects, while dodgy at times, are good for the era, fresh (not the same three shots over and over like Battlestar Galactica), and with numerous explosions involving fatalities.
Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory.
I'm convinced that had the original theme been pursued the second season would have been more exciting while still maintaining its scientifically realistic roots Â truly a loss for a truly brilliant show.
Martin Landau took up the lead as 'Commander John Koenig', the man responsible for making the important day-to-day decisions concerning the running of the base, while his then-wife Barbara Bain played 'Dr.Helena Russell', Alpha's chief scientific officer.
Landau was excellent, while Bain's performance has been the subject of much debate over the years, with many describing her as 'wooden'.
You'll have all those questions running through your mind while you're watching "Doctor's Wives", but this vapid, pointless, soap-opera-level film provides no answers.
This is a sterling example of big budget Hollywood trying to keep up with the hippy era sex revolution, while appealing to suburban Squaresville tastes, and the results are as unappetising as walking in on your parents in the backroom at a leather bar.
Hours later she's shot dead, while caught in the act with the first of her conquests.
One WASPy iceberg has a fling with a studly intern, while another pumps herself up with an aphrodisiac cocktail of morphine and champagne.
This involves a pretty young med student seducing as many hospital staffers as she can, and tape recording the details of intercourse while performing it, as a Kinsey style master's thesis.
He is injured badly, and while wrapped in facial bandages in hospital he makes the decision not to notify next of kin and drop out of his young wife's life because he feels he could never be the same man again, at least to her.
So while every ensuing meeting brings them closer to the truth of their former relationship, it is a very thin line indeed that separates them from the possibility of true recognition of each other and the memories of bygone days.
There are some side story lines such as Percy, the man Herman meets while watering flowers on his grandfather's grave.
I was able to figure it out after a while, but it jumped from scene to scene without smooth transitions of ideas.
Now while this movie is entertaining it nowhere has the magic of the original.
Not only a car mechanic, but a car mechanic that wears as little as she can, while SHE WELDS.
The whole time while watching this I found that I couldn't predict the next thing and I like that in a movie.
There was a nice development of the characters while still maintaining the action that I was looking for.
"Shakedown" by Bob Seger was nominated for an Academy Award for best song, while "I Want Your Sex" by George Michael won a Raqzzie for the worst song of the year.
Claude Rains excels as the villain of the piece, while Alan Hale, Eric Portman, and others make up the cast.
Every time you hear the score one almost picture a child giggling, while playing hide-and seek.
Edward, in Twain's story, while waiting for the sad news, meets Tom Canty, a boy who looks almost exactly like him (here played - for a change - by the Mauch Twins).
They pull this Jackhammering off with a fake jackhammer being jiggled around in the pushers mouth, while he spits out some blood, a cut to Jacks smiling face, back to the Jackhammer which is being shaken by Jack into a fake smashed head.
The first slasher movie in memory to blame its killer's antics on drugs...for a while, it even works too (with some nasty & gory special effects).
Duke Togo, while devoid of most emotion, captivates as a steely and ruthless assassin bent on survival as well as completion of his tasks.
The senior Dawson, now nearly insane with grief, launches an all-out war against Golgo 13, employing the most vicious and lethal professionals that his bottomless coffers can procure, including horrific ex-military sociopaths, crooked intelligence officials, and an unspeakably terrifying monster of a man who rightly goes by the moniker "Snake," all while Togo hops the globe carrying out other "jobs."
This is a really funny movie and if you haven't seen it in a while you should treat yourself and do so.
The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack.
Moreover,what i liked most-contrary to many people- was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you don't pay attention for a while you will "get lost".
The action here is a lot wilder too, but after a while it starts to get pointless, especially in the ending shoot-out.
There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the "bad guy" and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong.
Powell delivers his lines with eye-twinkling charm but he is no match for his leading lady: You know how all actresses, without exception act during the ball/party scene, when they flirt with their leading men while they are slightly tipsy?
Polish patriots kidnap a Romanov Grand Duke while he's on a holiday in Vienna.
And while that is probably no surprise, what got me was the constant examples of how we were portrayed.
The fact that he is such a calm soul while murdering people left and right, ironically, also ads to his charisma.
I discovered this awful flick on imbd by accident while doing a search for Ken Russell's "The Music Lover".
Along the way we see the "star's" family trying to fill in the blanks while they stumble through this tedious waste of film.
I hope Kids WB' keeps this show on for quite a while.
Distinctly Chinese in its orchestration, the fantasy elements are played up for the kids, the humour a little too cagey to really laugh at, while the martial arts spectacles are really quite astonishing.
Under the desperate circumstances, Power is approximating that standard by sacrificing those least likely to survive in order to save those most likely to survive, while the 'good' to be maximized is individual survival.
In the former he struggled to show a man who sought and found spiritual piece in the years following World War I, while his friends went mad in the materialistic hopelessness of Europe and America.
All powerful in his unwanted element while everyone's lives depended on him, he is all alone when the dangers for the survivors pass away.
You see, the problem is that, while you actually are capable of feeling of how much Dennis is a menace for retired men, you never really think that he's an interesting kid; he's very naive, over the top naive which is basically it.
Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops.
), while Philo Vance was still at his peak, Charlie Chan had just started his marathon run, and two years before Dashiel Hammett would backtrack to seemingly invent the "comedy mystery" in the first of the THIN MAN series, Stuart Palmer's "Hildegarde Withers" stories were pointing the way to that perfect bantering comedy.
In this film, Charlton Heston and Forrest Tucker as Wild Bill Hickok stumble upon a plot to detach California from the United States while the north and south sectional conflict edges closer to civil war.
If the movie hearkens back to simpler, more clear-cut times, it is at least nice to see heroes who genuinely like each other and who can get the job done while having some fun doing it, rather than today's friendless, dour-faced loners with chips on their shoulders who spend every waking minute searching for "the truth."
Happily, by this stage 'The Aristo-Cat' has already established itself as a must see and, while its eventual disintegration prevents it from entering the annals of the genuinely classic, the cartoon's first half ranks alongside some of the most startling imagery of any Warner cartoon.
One would use an axe while the other would use a rope to hang people.
My dad first told about this movie a while ago.
Well, here we are in 1941 with the same thing, a robot which turns into an airplane and back to a robot, all the while stealing money.
Eusebius is his practical, balanced side while Florestan is passionate and free-spirited.
I almost needed to wear a diaper I laughed so hard while watching this.
The plot, while not particularly deep, acts as a sort of clever satire on most comedy-adventures.
In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as "Me, Myself & Irene") - the difference here is that "Dumb and Dumber" manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.
Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker are excellent as the parents who certainly mean well but who don't always act in the best interest of their child, while Bruno Gans provides a strong emotional focal point as the loving grandfather who is the one person in Vitus' life who provides him with a safe place where he can live life without pressure and just be a normal kid.
Ballad of a Soldier is an exciting tale of a young soldier's adventure while returning home on leave.
But John/Erik (Welles), while he leaves Elizabeth for the good of the same cause he fervently believes in, can not participate.
Give it a little while to get going - it does spend some time to lay the ground work, but I don't really see a way to short cut it without losing the genuine and unassuming quality the director manages to preserve throughout the events that unfold.
But Joshua is a bad seed who spins out an aura of evil and fear off the screen as time goes on, while Vitus is geeky and a prig (for a while anyway) and has a lust for his baby sitter that's at best nutty, but he's otherwise ultimately sweet.
The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with, while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits.
Nonetheless the production design creates creepy atmosphere especially in the seaside alter where Dee is nearly undressed while Stockwell prepares her for the arrival of Satan himself.
I was supposed to be doing homework while I was watching it.
However, I lost interest in this movie after a while and was just waiting for it to end, and did not really care how it ended.
second one is the one scene that contains an explosion and where the cgi effects are VERY bad( while that is not important to the plot at all, somehow will affect your impression and visual perceptions since the suspense about around there is great- kind of a "let down" for a few moments).
while the resemblance to the best thriller is too MUCH to be "respected" as an original feature in itself, i give credits to the whole cast for being able to pull it off with enough style as not to "disappoint".
it is a good watch nevertheless, and will not disappoint you if you can "pass" the explosion scene without loosing any interest... so the plot gets 10 stars( while i will ignore the similarities, they are different in context itself and do make perfect sense overall ), the acting gets 10 as well( i can not think of anyone that was playing "badly"), the soundtrack gets an 8 ( great musical choices but not consistent, again a sign of low budget),the camera work gets a 10( great achievement for a low budget), the script gets a 5( 1 for originality in essence and 10 for consistency), and finally the cgi effects get a more then deserved 1 star.
This trial and error process nestles in with the overall study, while Alyosha's naivety will see him, in a gleeful and euphoric mood at the time following the granting of the six day leave, happily take on the extra burden of delivering a gift from one soldier to their partner along the way; something that we will eventually come to realise merely delays the lead as well as put his life at needless risk.
She comes to resent Welles' presence while nonetheless suspecting that he may in fact be....
Somewhat far-fetched and sentimental, it's a well cast topical weeper that manages, paradoxically, to maintain a tone of high seriousness while nevertheless skirting most of the issues it raises.
Without giving anything away, Slow Burn deals with corruption and a little gang-related mystery; all the while providing that sense of empathy for Liotta's character that seems all too absent in modern films today.
The script, while horribly convoluted and needlessly confusing, is bearable.
It was that fuel, made from liquefied coal, that had Germany hold off defeat while inflicting millions of allied casualties for some two years after it's supply of oil, mostly from the Romanian Ploesti Oil Field, was obliterated by allied daylight bombings in 1943.
Some of Avildsen's suggestions were restored while others weren't.
Caught this while doing some work at my desk and saw it had George C Scott, a favorite of mine.
It takes Caine a while to uncover this and the plot takes a number of twists and turns.
This series put Universal in the front of sci-fi developement for a while.
The special effects are still spectacular to this day, and while they could have cheapened the actual drama of the show, they didn't.
The Galactica, herself, is a huge and powerful vessel, while retaining a charm that few other ships can keep.
Richard Hatch played his son Apollo, while a scene-stealing Dirk Bennedict played his roguish friend Starbuck.
Brooke Shields' acting was, while commendable for your average twelve-year-old, uneven, to be kind.
Yet he is most certainly interested in a romantic relationship, as well, even while he wants to pretend it's a father/daughter relationship.
That isn't what I experienced while watching it.
I would watch it again because there is so much going on I'm sure I missed something while I was fixated on the sets and costumes.
Malle is another reason this movie is worth while.
It's that much more disconcerting because all the while you're keenly aware that this isn't based on "a true story" but on millions of true stories throughout history, including today, and in every part of the globe.
The DOP, while being a pompous ass, managed to turn out something that looked grainy and amateurish.
The melody is powerful and epic while being traditional and intimate at the same time.
Patrick Dewaere was a wonderful comic actor (see him in Les Valseuses), while Ariel Besse was rather, er, young.
Rating: 5/5  Acting: Mark Hamill does an awesome job of playing Colonel Christopher Blair with his smart-aleck lines while talking to the people on the ship to his taunts while in the cockpit(Example:"Say goodnight kitty!
On MTM she mostly played straight woman, and while the show more or less revolved around her, Valerie Harper or Ed Asner or another actor were the larger sources of humor.
On DVD, while Rose Marie was originally planned to be the comedic center of the show, Moore took over more and more of that focus as the show developed.
In this episode, Alex reveals so much depth of a character, he exhibits regret for not going with his friend, realization of the useless meaning of being ambitious while everything is going to end one day and at the same time he gets you laughing while he is visiting a shrink for help and the latter turns out to be a Grant College graduate, same college where Malory is studying and Alex always makes fun of it.
Fox's show with his hilarious depiction of Alex P. Keaton, who has a tendency to wear shirt & tie everyday around the house and introduces little brother Andrew to the Wall Street Journal while he's still in diapers!
The mystery holds for a while, then this viewer became a bit tired of scene after scene of talky explanations, and not much cinematic action.
Hodiak and leading lady Nancy Guild, while meant to evoke Bogey and Bacall, are about as interesting as watching paint dry in this overlong derivative production.
Hodiak is a passive leading man, while the attractive Guild almost steals the movie from him.
If you want to be hypercritical about it and you delight in pointing out plot holes, you may give this movie a bad review, while at the same time flaunting your critical chops.
If you believe, just go with the flow, and you'll be smiling while your eyes mist up, for it's a hopeful and heartwarming story that you don't find too often in our jaded, cynical world.
When he's playing on the bridge his first time out it's so awful, a rhythm part is being played while he has both hands on the upper neck of the guitar???
Then August, whose only been in NYC for a little while is able to run through subway systems, find his way to Central Park and get access to back stage where they have a tux and tails waiting for him even though he was not supposed to show.
One of them takes the woman with him and after a while she kills him for what he had done to her.
Lady Snowblood tries to kill her, she escapes, and while searching for her they find her hanging from the ceiling.
Freddie Highmore is cute, but is really called upon to do little more than look glowingly happy while playing music and sad while thinking about his parents.
Firstly, being a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers I had been hearing about this project for a while and I couldn't figure out how they'd make sense out of it.
The scenes have an appealing fantasy element, while at the same time, the plot manages to explore true-to-life human situations such as bullying of those who are different.
Not one laugh, chuckle, tee-hee or even a smile came across my face while this was on.
Rather unsung, but worthwhile, this tear-jerking wartime drama will entrance some viewers while unintentionally amusing others.
Unabashedly sentimental and heart-tugging, it is likely to please fans of tear-jerkers while causing the eyes of pragmatists to roll feverishly.
The whole plot centers on a political campaign and while most movies that attempt to portray a campaign tend to stumble, this one falls flat on its face."
And while getting drunk and having coffee is certainly the way for a relationship to begin, there was nothing on screen to justify Noseworthy doing this, especially since they don't end up together in the end.
Knowing that she would not have a chance to get revenge towards the others while stuck in prison, Yuki's mother continuously whored herself to any male she could just so she could become pregnant.
The battles, while not as long as you'd expect, are appropriately staged in grand style with victims falling to the sword in number, screaming from the agony as Yuki slices her way through them.
But, Fujita does provide a backstory Yuki lives within, a land riddled in wickedness and corruption, and she is a symbol of justice, while her adversaries represent the evils that are sweeping the country.
Kaji's performance is stunning(..those moments where we actually see on her face how wrought in agony she is when facing the idea that one of her quarry possibly escapes the slice of her sword while alive, especially)and this is quite an iconic character.
I originally saw this film shortly after the release of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and while I was impressed by the amount of bloodshed, I didn't hold the film in particularly high regard.
Director Toshiya Fujita has created a film that, while somewhat shallow, lays on the style thick and this coupled with the heavy amount of bloodshed means that Lady Snowblood hits all the right notes.
The character herself is played by Meiko Kaji (who also took the lead role in the fantastic Female Prisoner Scorpion series) and while she is a lady of few words, it's easy to get involved with her thirst for revenge because of the interesting atmosphere surrounding the character.
If you are having trouble reading the book, I would suggest seeing this version of the movie, as it is very close to the actual novel, and it might help to add more of a picture to your mind while reading it.
I picked up Jane Austen's book Pride & Prejudice while in high school and I couldn't make myself get past the first chapter... that and the fact that I don't typically like period dramas (they usually aren't done too well), I was hesitant when a friend casually mentioned that it was good, though long.
While Mrs. Bennet wasn't the most agreeable person in the world, I believe that she has been represented better in the movie version because while still being a hyperactive, over-emotional woman, she was aware her daughters would be left destitute if they did not marry well.
The central message of the story which I found personally educational is the moment when Elizabeth, having thought herself an excellent judge of human character, while reading Darcy's letter realizes that she has entirely deceived herself with regards to the character of both Wickham and Darcy and that this self deception has resulted from vanity, because Wickham flattered her whereas Darcy insulted her with his "She is tolerable I suppose, though not handsome enough to tempt me."
(in another movie called Fever Pitch)) I love the following scenes:  "You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you";  "and when sanctioned by your excellent parents..." dab dab collapsing sweatily against the doorpost while Lizzie rapidly retreats, finishing his speech to himself "I am sure that my proposals will not fail in being... acceptable";  "the Look" as my wife calls it between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley;  the party at Netherfield where most of the Bennets disgrace themselves;  Lady Catherine 'refuses her consent';  Mr Collins' visit to 'condole' with the Bennets;  "for it has been many months since that I have considered her the most handsome woman of my aquaintance" so there!
The scene where he and Elizabeth dance a long and stately dance together in the midst of a crowd is both controlled and exciting - with very little change of tone, and while preserving the most correct decorum, their conversation reveals dangerous undercurrents of emotion, and meanwhile the steps of the dance keep pulling them together and apart again.
Alison Steadman's histrionics and fickle opinions are wonderful as the mom, and remind me very much of an actual relative of mine, while Benjamin Whitrow is a great counterpart as the father who is outwardly usually calm and peaceful, yet always able to rile up his wife.
However, unlike many of the films made during that time period Lady Snowblood remains popular because while its plot had been done many times before, including Suzuki Norifumi's Sex and Fury which was filmed the same year and whose background plot is almost identical to Lady Snowblood, it possesses a certain style that differentiates it from many other films from this time period namely that the heroine seems to be able to keep her clothes on throughout the entire film and that while it has lots of blood and gore, another influence evident in Kill Bill, it is not too overdone.
However, while searching for the other three she is arrested and put in prison.
I am not ashamed to admit I got interested in it after it being linked to Kill Bill, but then again, I hadn't heard of it until a while after the Kill Bill movies came out, and I thought it sounded like something I'd be interested in, my kind of movie.
The story is an eternal one: Virtuous young man in the face of chaos struggles to maintain the fabric of order in a basically disorderly universe while falling in love and being too virtuously shy to declare his feelings to the girl he loves, beating up bad guys and defending the honor of helpless young women and, revealing to the world the archvillain at the root of the evil in the empire.
They decide to set some seismograph's up near the base of the volcano to measure it's activity, the group set off but hadn't counted on there being a 30 foot genetically created 'supergator' that kills & eats anyone it comes across & it's heading straight for the holiday resort where it has plenty of tasty humans to pick from...  King of the rip-off cheapies Roger Corman strikes again, this straight-to-video Sci Fi Channel creature feature was executive produced by Corman while it was co-written & directed by Brian Clyde & isn't anything particularly special although it passes the time harmlessly enough if you don't expect too much.
The creature looks EXACTLY like DinoCroc, with one small exception -- DinoCroc spent most of his time walking around on two legs, while Supergator is strictly quadrupedal.
It's not like I watch Sci-Fi channel for its important and life-affirming programing...but every once in a while, some good t&a is integral to one's developmental health, and this movie was full of it.
For an animal that size, after chomping down four or five people, it would hole up in its lair to digest for quite a while.
Characters with "Next victim" written on their faces always seem to fall down while running so the thing can devour them.
I saw it again recently and while it had perhaps lost a little of its luster I thought it was still pretty funny.
it will make you want to scream and shout while your playing because it is so scary.
This one has a good story of a girl who while at the mall starts to see weird things, then of course monsters show up and our gal named Heather must navigate the demented mall, which gets even more demented after a ride in an elevator.
It takes a while before you realize what exactly is going on, without this losing any of its gripping tension.
When the time comes, the dog pig pushes her down (while she's smiling), and then rips an arm off of her.
Now, while that may sound fairly intriguing, Drzick fails to motivate the viewer to invest any empathy or emotion into the film.
Lynn Drzick (who is not a professional, or arguably even an amateur, director), does an astounding job of making this film unbearable by zooming in nice and close while his stone faced cast deliver their lines in some of the most dreadful monotone ever filmed.
For me, the performances by Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles are their most effective; hers ranks with her work in "Three Came Home" and "Since You Went Away," while his is even finer than in "The Stranger."
Just seeing Daffy dressed up in Robin Hood's green-and-red outfit and playing the mandolin while singing is pretty funny in itself Porky Pig plays Friar Tuck.
Curiously enough, this is only Hammer's second foray into Wolf Man lore after THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961); intriguingly, it's mixed here with a VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960)-like brood of evil children Â while the sinister procreation plot is a clear nod to ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968).
The bewildered hero is played by Christopher Cazenove, his business partner by Hammer veteran Robert Urquhart, while Diana Dors is the deceptively genial housekeeper of the eerie mansion Â who, apart from looking after the children by day, has the task of initiating the werewolf's female victims (the latest being Cazenove's wife) into their new 'role'.
Fernando Rey and Jack Taylor are Nazi hunters while Christopher Mitchum is a crippled American mercenary employed by Mengele (Howard Vernon.)
One of the few weaknesses of the film is that, while it touches on such subjects as civil unrest, governmental and corporate corruption, and underground terrorism, the script doesn't provide enough of an historical context (i.e.
But the biggest complaints to voice would be the lack of general thematic focus, and the fact that the majority of the better material in the story is told in the first half and the second, while still good, really doesn't work as compelling stuff.
Nicola is the younger, free spirited and philosophical brother while Matteo is more outspoken, with a hot temper and closed personality.
Yet as the story continues, Nicola focuses on his psychiatric career and their daughter, while Giulia abandons her music and turns away from them to go underground as a revolutionary.
Or, as Myshkin, I grab one or another misplaced acquaintance, long gone well before my mountaineering days, and march her way above the timberline to some icy col only to play at not knowing the way back down while sweet panic and thunderheads well.
Most Italian films are either shown in hardly any movie theatres - if any at all - while American blockbusters clog the screens of Italian cinemas up and down the peninsula for months (cliched 1960s terminology such as "cultural imperialism" springs to mind!).
Early on in the film, young mental patient Giorgia, whom Matteo is charged with taking for walks while he's still a student, introduces the theme of psychiatry and its evolution from the 60s to the present day.
I was furious that this was taking place while OJ was on trial and it was the stupid OJ trial we were being bombarded with day in and day out while genocide was taking place.
I missed the opening as I found this documentary while zapping.
At one point he wandered drunkenly through the streets of Ottawa while he contemplated suicide.
*spoilers in here* "Shake Hands With The Devil" reviews the experiences of Canadian Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who was head of the UN troops in Rwanda in 1994, while filming his return to Rwanda for the 10th anniversary of the genocide in 2004.
And to see CNN and the media giving Iraq and the Asian tsunami 24/7 coverage while making Rwanda and Darfur a footnote on the back pages is nothing short of horrendous.
It absolutely astounded me to see this self-righteous and self-centered man thinking about the loss of two men while nearly a million were butchered.
Bono once said that this generation will be remembered for standing by with water while Africa burned.
The plot mostly flows well and while it's usually fairly clear where it's going, A Quiet Place to Kill still manages to be interesting.
Like the film THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO (please see companion review) the movie "The Healer" is a study of the degrees to which human beings can enjoy the gift of human sexuality while simultaneously attempting to serve as channels for spiritual healing, social harmony, and political integrity.
It probably helped that they fell for each other in real life over the course of this film, prompting Crudup to leave his wife, Mary Louise-Parker, while she was pregnant.
Their relationship is destroyed, while Nick's collapse proves to have been more than an accident; he has contracted cancer.
Maria is in love with Ned who is, at least, potentially bisexual while actually intimate with one of the king's favorites, the second Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin).
And for the first time ever in a movie a king of England is shown cavorting in the royal rack with his mistress while six adorable King Charles Spaniels look on.
It tries to do some different things for a movie of its types while doing some of the things these types of movies are known for mainly the giant puppet monsters and the completely off the wall scenes like hang gliding with a flying dinosaur.
Every once in a while avid movie connoisseurs are treated to a veritably timeless piece of cinematic art.....Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Seven Samurai, Yor: The Hunter From The Future......erm OK so I lied about the last one but ye gods - you'll never forget this movie once you've watched it!
The freaky threesome are actually a nice, happy dysfunctional family: a crackpot dad who likes to do the dirty murderous deed while wearing a rubbery Richard Nixon mask, a bumbling imbecile son, and another insane, sanguinary idiot male offspring with live maggots residing in his scrambled cranium (!).
while this is happening the city fathers from the clueless mayor, John Cawford, on down are only interested in being politically correct and force on it's top cop Insp.
Maybe it's the Tyne Daly interview scene with the woman's rights liaison sanctimoniously commenting on equality while Harry lam-basts her with a "what would you do in this situation?"
Too often, we go along like sheep while the bureaucrats do their song and dance.
Finally Harry is suspended and while he sits this out the Terrorists seize the mayor hostage and hole up on alcatraz.
I would rather hold my grandmas hand while she's on the toilet than watch even a second of this movie again.
A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.
Grant tries to hide Dunne's identity from his bride while trying to figure out what to do.
Watch him scuttle across the balcony of the house with his wife's dresses, his legs working like a marionette's while his head advances in a level line without bouncing at all.
Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous, and it remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things.
Grant "wants to go to bed" in her room, while Dunne won't let him as long as he won't forgive her.
And then there's the scene of Grant looking through women's clothing, holding them up to a mirror, while telling a doctor, "I have to go, he's waiting for me in the car!"
That's the situation facing Nick Arden (Grant), and while some men may relish the idea of having two wives, it nearly drives him insane!
Casting is excellent--you can't feel very sorry for the wronged bride or for the cheerful disappointed suitor; the kids are funny, neither sentimentalized nor smart alecky; the judge and hotel manager are gems; and Cary Grant and Irene Dunne manage to generate sparks while seeming as comfortable together as old shoes.
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
I've thought about it for a while and I came to the conclusion that it's Grant's professional training that prevents him from just confessing to one and all what's happened.
But really, one must be indulgent, critically; there is priceless stuff in this film's fibre, and while it fires not on all screwball-comedy cylinders, it is a very pleasant feature with glorious screen presences making (deceptively) light of life.
This movie features the return of one of my all time favorite Abbott and Costello routines, pack and unpack, in which Costello is going back and forth changing his pants while Abbott is trying to make up his mind if they should escape or not.
The real gem of this feature is a terrific scene near the end, as Abbott and Costello engage in an endless array of crazy conversations, and it's one of the best things they ever did that managed to get captured on film: the boys are eating dinner at a fancy restaurant in an effort to run up a huge bill to get deliberately arrested when they cannot pay the check... all the while they're tangled up in a delicious diatribe where Abbott rants about the values of "Mustard", going into the "Ball Park," having a "Headache," asking Costello how he could "Marry a 10 Year Old Girl", and more!
The camera work is awful, with the usual shaky-cam work trying to give it a gritty feel (I would suggest changing the sheets on your bed Mr Director - bound to be some grit floating about there), sometimes the main subject of a shot is out of focus while, for instance, a bus window frame is in focus... poor poor poor.
Excellent in style, and while the pace of the film does start quite slow, it does draw you in, I thought Nicholas Bool was fantastic in it.
The film has won awards and rightly so, while everyone is entitled to their opinion I personally believe the last review was a poor one and that this is a film to be commended.
It took a while for this movie to get released, but it was well worth the wait.
Unfortunately House of 1000 Corpses, while certainly expressing Zombie's love for old school shock horror, is simply too convoluted, elaborate and often boring to send a single shiver up the spine.
When it comes to leaving you dumbfounded and gasping at the screen - jaw dropped quicker than if you just received a shattering right hook from Mike Tyson Â then Horror House on Highway Five has crossed the finish line while the others are still tying up their shoe-laces.
Then there are the two demented kidnappers - one of them believing that his brain is being destroyed by parasites, while the other acts equally like the mushrooms that he ate with his fried breakfast were certainly those of the 'magic' variety.
Get out there and enjoy this rare experience while you still can.
Once you get used to his accent and flattop haircut, a slight twitchiness in his manner, and people calling him "Card Sense Jimmy Bond", he's easy and interesting to watch, managing to look both cool and concerned while still pulling off a nice Roger Moore-ish quip or two.
Michael Pate as Leiter is pretty solid and a believable ally, while Linda Christian is the only weak link in the chain.
Every once in a while, however, I'll rent a "high-brow" movie and often I am bored to tears.
A Young Mother (an astonishingly fine performance by Michelle Williams) opens the film with thoughts and demonstrations of the love she holds for her young son (Sidney Johnson) while she copes with the too frequent absences of her husband Lenny (Nicholas Gleaves): Lenny is part of London's Anti-terrorism division of the police force.
One of the bikers get away, while the other two are sent to an early grave.
Better still, this fine freaky flick certainly doesn't skimp on the copious gratuitous nudity: adorable baby doll beauty Dawn Dunlap bares her whole bod while bagging a few rays in a sauna, stupendously slinky British blonde bombshell June Chadwick (Lydie on the short-lived "V" TV series) happily hops in the sack with Colby a mere five or six hours after making his acquaintance, and both Dawn and June even take a shower together.
Allan Holzman stuck with the basics: Slimy alien running loose on isolated space station with nubile females showering together while scruffy 2 day growth faced action types search for it with flashlights and ineffective weapons.
As Bobby tells the somewhat lame story they have a fourth friend named Matt (Ron Pilillo) on his way to join them, however while driving he stops to offer a pretty young woman a lift home...
This was a series that was groundbreaking while it was on the air and for one was devided by a significiant segment of the black community as not being political or angry enough,owing largely to its status as an lighthearted sitcom.
Her boss was Dr. Morton Chegley was played by Lloyd Nolan,while her co-worker Nurse Hannah Yarby was played by Lurene Tuttle.
Their recognition of a possible romance comes while she dissects a corpse's right knee.
We first encounter Dr. Bell while he is whipping the buttocks of a corpse, prior to firing a bullet into the dead man's chest.
It is my view that in each and every case the film version is superior if assessed in itself, while the book version fits more properly into the work as a whole.
It looks about as much like the real Silver City as some place in South Africa, with extras frequently standing around ogling the camera while Goldblum et al.
This film points out how while the government was out hunting Communist, they were behaving exactly like the Communist they were so worried about and feared.
NOTE: the current worldwide interest in LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY should make it worth the studio's while to issue a QUALITY restored edition of 1936 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY.
They while away the time telling ghost stories.
(I swear they hired Abigail Wolcott to play "Josie" because she had nice legs...She even "strikes poses" while being carried away and raped! )
It is a difficult film to watch at times, and it does take a while for the film to get going.
Every once in a while you come across a documentary film that is entertaining and dramatic, regardless of whether or not you like the subject matter.
Grubeck is given his statutory one phone call which he uses to phone 976-EVIL a direct line to hell, Grubeck is given powers which enable him to astrally project himself while asleep & is also given the name of the drunk who meets a very sticky end that night.
It's pretty bland & forgettable stuff while the gore is also disappointing, someone is impaled, someone has a garden trowel stuck in them in a direct rip-off, sorry homage to Night of the Living Dead (1968), a few after the fact slit throats, & in the films best moment a guy is hit by a speeding truck & he just explodes everywhere, excellent.
The difference is this one is about the horror and morality about an issue of a scientific level, while 'The Body Snatcher' was more a character driven film that looked how guilt, greed and pride can personally destroy someone by becoming an unwanted ordeal.
Also through aspects of the plot you can tell its having a scathing attack on the upper class (Dr. Knox) by taking advantage of the certain situations by getting the poor to do their dirty work for them, while keeping their hands basically clean.
"); Cushing, of course, is equally commanding while addressing his lectures or when scrutinizing the newest corpse.
The film makes a fine, though essentially unpleasant, companion piece to the more literate and subtle THE BODY SNATCHER (1945); the theme was again handled (by another horror veteran, Freddie Francis) a quarter of a century later in THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS (1985) - while Gilling himself had contributed to the script of an earlier variation, THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART (1948), starring Tod Slaughter!
And, while Christopher Lee might for once be missing as Cushing's co-star, Donald Pleasance proves himself to be a wonderfully adept replacement.
Eventually Burke and Hare are captured for their crimes, the latter testifying against his accomplice to save his skin (though he is later pursued and blinded by a hateful mob), while - most disturbing of all - the cruel and calculating Dr. Knox is ultimately pardoned for his own part in the affair.
Burke and Hare's modus operandi as well as their negotiations with Dr. Knox really were this clumsy and unscrupulous while Knox damn well knew about the suspicious methods of the two, but he couldn't care less as long the study-objects he received were fresh and supplied regularly.
It stays perfectly on the line between over-the-top farce while appearing to try to be a "real" film, in true Ed Wood fashion.
I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole.
There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen (she who fails to rewind her videos) sings loudly and tunelessly along to "Tomorrow" from the musical "Annie" while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is, to say the least, a somewhat strange person.
Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death with a slab of pork chop (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store) while watching a videotape of "Annie"?
It's one of those films that constantly make you laugh (providing you've got a sick sense of humour), while poking fun at society and offending all the right people all at once!
One of her killings involves dropping the stage lights at a concert on the head of her son's friend and then proceeding to set him on fire while the audience applauds her sadism, but Waters doesn't glorify the act: during the trial, the prosecutor displays photographs of the burnt corpse, but everyone in the courtroom is distracted by the presence of Suzanne Somers.
In one scene, a future victim of hers is watching Annie and singing along to "Tomorrow" while her dog licks her feet: now THAT'S frightening.
The movie has just created an imaginary world especially while describing the Turks.
Anna Heymes (Arly Jover), the wife of a respected government official Laurent (Philippe Bas) is having a rare amnesia and nightmarish hallucinations of horrible murders, while in the Turkish neighborhood of Paris, Police Captian Paul Nerteaux (Jocelyn Quivrin) is trying to solve the possible serial killings of the illegal Turkish women with the help of an ex-cop Jean-Louis Schiffer (Jean Reno), who is also an expert in Turkish underworld and organized crime.
In all, one of the best action films I've seen in a while, highly recommended within its genre.
Maybe that was the only aspect they concentrated on while doing this movie and still I don't understand this etruscan book idea where it came from.
the standard movie starts at one point, and the rest of the movie branches off from there, while u know exactly what is going on.
The blood and violence being the only thing that made it worth while.
Similar is every other character; while Rachael Leigh Cook does a rather good job with her Lucy Stanton (a character unfortunately and implausibly called 'Luce' and pronounced 'loose' by her father), she has very little to do but be a victim of her father's obnoxiousness and some sort of bizarre Satanic cult that is only given a raison d'etre in the last twenty minutes.
So while this film does have many flaws, it's biggest letdown is that it is simply not scary, and what more should you be looking for in a horror film.
The clock, counting down to Satan's earthly manifestation, makes regular appearances, and while this isn't an unprecedented device for enhancing suspense, the construction of the clock face is intriguing and it's just as interestingly shot and edited as the rest of the film.
She was a delight then, and she has evolved into a wonderful actress while still maintaining a charismatic presence.
Ironically, while it was probably a sensation to see the portrayal of a black president in the 1970's, today's audiences aren't surprised to see James Earl Jones in the CIA/White House in the Tom Clancy movies.
Larry, the "missing pilot", had planned to marry "Ann Deever", who's father was Keller's business partner, who went to prison while "Joe Keller",(Robinson) was acquitted of any wrong doing at the trial because he was home sick.
Folks around town suspect Joe's hands weren't clean, and Joe got away with it while Herb was made the fall guy.
George wasn't happy about his sister marrying into the family that looked the other way while his and Ann's father took the rap and went to prison for sending bad parts for military airplanes, which crashed and killed dozens of men in the war.
But while Willy Loman has a dirty secret that cost him his son's respect for him as a father, Keller has a dirty secret that makes him a criminal.
Unlike American films of the period, it's more patronising than openly defamatory and while he's hardly a role model, Robeson's convict-turned-king plays a more central role in the plot than Leslie Banks condescendingly paternalistic British commissioner ("Sandi the Brave, Sandi the Wise/Righter of Wrongs, Hater of Lies!").
Characters such as Mandy are bitter and painful to watch, while the rest are lacking in basic intelligence, like Billy for instance.
I've liked this show for a while.
Another reason is because the only intelligent human in the show is Mandy, while everyone else is either stupid or insane.
I put this movie on while doing something else and ended up watching the whole thing standing up(a first for me).
)The thing that changes them is the new English teacher Mr Keating,who Tells them they should "be themselves" and not "act like sheep".Tood and Neil find out that Mr Keating used to be in a club called The Dead Poets society.After hearing about this,Tood and Neil decide to re-open the club to get themselves "Free",this will sadly end with one of them tacking there own life.... View on the film: The screenplay:written by Tom Schulman,while the film has a bit of a thin plot,Schulman makes the film feel like a really great European-type character driven film.The other things that is done very well is the change halfway into the film,where it takes on a very dark turn.While most movies would find it hard to change gears like that,this movie does it really well.
Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.
And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.
& Stiggs" which ran for a while back around the late 70's/early 80's then you will probably like it a lot.
Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority.
Major plot developments happen off camera, or while multiple people are talking.
Since his screen debut in 1915, Fairbanks had always been cast in contemporary comedies as a fun-loving, never-say-die, go-getter who gets the girl and catches the bad guys Â all the while exhibiting his athletic prowess and bravado.
He plays Fairbanks' dastardly nemesis Don Sebastian while directing one of his best films.
The ending was REAL bad but, for a while, that had me shaking.
Eventually the film does build to a satisfyingly gruseome supernatural climax that apparently took so much of the movies' low budget production cost that the filmmakers appear to have literally run out of money while four of the ten were making a frenzied escape through the woods.
I don't remember what film we intended to see, a comedy I believe, but when I saw there was a horror movie playing in the other theater I decided to watch it while my brother saw the comedy.
But you have to keep in mind, that while talk of "urban legends" are pretty commonplace today, back in the late 70's, these legends were just that: Legends, not the stuff of Discovery Channel debunking programs, or community college courses.
And while the revelation of the light is a common snickering point among reviewers, I have to admit, something about the unexplainable nature of the explanation has stayed with me to this day.
Zero Mostel is very capable as the sweaty, nervous Big Babe Lazich, while Everett Sloan makes a dapper Mr. Big.
Though Rico dies in a fall while trying to escape from testifying, we later see him in a flashback scene recounting how he was present at Mendoza's first "hit" of a cafÃ© owner.
The only negative about the film, and it's a tiny one, is that while Bogart's character is the prosecutor, he sure acts like a police detective!
Oddly, while an excellent movie, it is probably among the actors least famous and recognized films.
But while Mendoza is in jail, the man lined up to testify against him loses his nerve and falls to his death, thus leaving Ferguson little to no time to rebuild a case against the crime lord.
The chief witness is Ted DeCorsia who after an attempt on his life, falls to his death while trying to escape from a window.
now CTHD has been mentioned in an earlier review here and while i can (just) see that you can link the two, if nothing else it has opened up more main-stream audiences to subtitles, to compare them is really very, very pointless.
He shows the ability to tell a story confidently and has no problems in going back and forward in time while he is unfolding the love story of the 2 main characters.He also has an technical ability not forgetting any detail showed previously in the film.
And, while I loved the liberal trashing of the extreme right-wing conservative neighbor, the movie was quite mean-spirited at times.
As young adults, Dum (Thai heartthrob Chartchai Ngansam) joins a gun-slinging outlaw band known as The Tigers, while Rumpoey is betrothed to a slick, handsome police captain, Kumjorn.
However, their difference in status (he's the son of a servant, while she, the daughter of the governor) meant that it's a forbidden romance to begin with.
A man gotta do what a man gotta do, and during one of his missions, he failed to meet up with Rumpoey presumably to elope, while she took it as a sign that he didn't want to.
And that's not the least of it, as the unexpected plot twists mount while Schaffner starts to look like the least corrupt person in the film compared to the strokes Noel Willman's patiently greedy Mexican police chief and Bernard Lee's determined but less than ethical Scotland Yard man are willing to pull to either get his money or lure him across the bridge...  Ken Annakin's film may be shot on location in Spain, but it has a resolutely British studio look to both its photography and its interior work (as well as its rather over-emphatic James Bernard score) - you can take the British out of Britain but not the Britishness out of their films, it seems.
Steiger's performance is at once theatrical (while contained enough not to descend into the ham of later roles) yet convincing - and the existence of similar fraudsters like Robert Maxwell only adds to the credibility.
Woman after woman appeared in the film naked or semi-naked and drenched in blood while being brutalized.
And, while the plot is silly and hard to believe, it is so light-hearted that this isn't important.
The absolute high point of this absurdity is the figure of Roosevelt, slinging his revolver faster than Wyatt Earp while heroically leading the charge.
Now, while this movie tends to over-exaggerate and wander off the beaten path, I can't take anything away from Sam Elliot.
William Tiffany died, probably of malaria, while awaiting transport from Cuba.
this is an excellent film that most have never heard of because it was made for TV (turner)and never shown in the theater.not much to add except that the film sheds light on the short and little known 1898 Spanish-American war which while trumped up by the media(newspaper publisher William Randolph Hurst played superbly by George Hamilton)catapulted the up until then isolationist united states on to the world stage for the first time and which gave the united states control of Spanish territories around the globe-Cuba,Puerto Rico the Philippines,wake island,Guam and the Marshall islands.and allowing the united states to flex its military might globally for the first time.there are some historical inaccuracies(such as the imperial German army advisor's aiding the Spanish, director john milius also made the turn of the century imperial Germans the bad guys in his 1975 film THE WIND AND THE LION in which Brian Keith played teddy Roosevelt as president during an international incident resolved by his big stick diplomacy-sending the marines.if you liked rough riders see the wind and the lion.
I'll skip trying to tell you what was on these peoples mind when they went to war, however, TR had been de facto Secretary of the Navy and a politician for quite a while so I vote for less naivete than hinted at by another commentator.
An ex-Confederate officer (portrayed by Gary Busey, who nearly steals the film), Wheeler takes a liking to Wood and Roosevelt, and to 'Black Jack' Pershing's 'Buffalo Soldiers' (the famous Black regiment), over the 'regular Yankees', and does his best to give them preference, while offering his 'unreconstructed' advice.
The last half and hour of the movie makes it all very worth while.
Throughout the story, it appears that Aunt Maude is having the best time of it all, while casting a romantic eye in the direction of good old Doc.
The plane has been broken in half while crash landing & the end with the radio & black box in is somewhere deep in the jungle, a group decide to go look for it & try to radio for help.
But, whereas Pirahna was created as a fun, tongue in cheek, little thriller that knew to cleverly mock its source material all the while winking at the audience, the good folks at the Asylum only wish to cash in and worry about product quality later...much later.
In 1863, while the War Between the States still raged, a large group of Confederate prisoners were held in a sun baked stockade at Fort Bravo, Arizona Territory.
It takes a while for it to take off so to speak but when it does there are some real thrilling action and some real good scenes and moments you don't easily will forget.
I recommend this to western fans with some patience because, as written, it takes a while for it to reach climax, but when it does, you won't forget you watched it.
"Escape" boasts a very tough-talking script, with glints of humor coming from the bickerings between (those great character actors) Williams Demarest and Campbell, and its final third is remarkably suspenseful, as Roper, Carla and the escaped rebs are laid siege in a ditch, while the Mescaleros pick them off with rifle shot and lob volleys of arrows into their midst.
During this time, a female Confederate sympathizer, played by Eleanor Parker, comes to the fort and will attempt to distract Holden, while she manages to enact the escape of her Confederate lover, played by John Forsythe.
He sets out in their pursuit, ignoring that outside, and around him, in the wilderness, common enemy is watching, the deadly Mescalero Indians...  Holden is stern, enigmatic and firm as the brusque young officer, who keeps the restless prisoners in Fort Bravo while trying to keep out marauding Indians...
On a visit to the Fort for a wedding is the lovely Carla Forester (Eleanor Parker) whose real business is to arrange for the escape of her confederate officer lover (John Forsyth) and three of his men while at the same time ensuring Captain Roper falls for her charms, little suspecting that she herself would fall in love with him.
The reason has more to do with the highly publicized divorce trial from Lita Grey that Chaplin endured while filming the feature over two years, as well as a host of other production disasters.
In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.
While doing the very funny high-wire act, his right pant leg came off while he was holding on to the pole for balance and monkeys were climbing all on and around him.
In a picture filled with an excess of wonderful vignettes, chased by a mad donkey while holding an enormous stack of dishes, Charlie's surprise when he opens a trunk to find it full of wild monkeys, his boastfulness at surviving a moment trapped in the lions cage only to be frightened by a kitten, and William Tell with a banana, Chaplin left still more on the cutting room floor.
'The Circus'may not be Chaplin's very best movie,but it is a joy to watch,especially when you consider the turmoil he was going through while he was making it.
Chaplin, as the Tramp, gets mixed up with a pickpocket while visiting the circus.
But while "Limelight" focuses mostly on the interaction between the performer and the audience, this film seems to explore two different themes relating to performance: its hypocrisy (the tryout, being told to eat the apple by the director and then being chastised for eating it by the actor), and humour in its deficiencies (note the uproar when Chaplin knocks the table off, exposing the hidden man feeding the animals through the hats).
I actually watched it on TV while living with a family in St. Petersburg, Russia, and they laughed their heads off just watching him perform his stunts.
Are we really supposed to believe that Crawford ran to the front door, switched the guns and ran back again while Nunnally was agonizing over the body?
An officer can not fire his gun without accounting for each and every bullet, he also writes a report after every event that would have shown he had put his gun down while he turned his back, which he wouldn't have done to start with.
Hopkins clearly enjoys playing this sort of manipulative role, controlling events, making sly remarks, and winking in that very obviously shifty way, and he gets to drive flashy cars and live in a big house while he does it, which I imagine only increases the amount of fun he has.
The love story while not necessarily essential didn't take anything away from the other parts either.
Hopkins and Gosling play the cat-and-mouse game with conviction and gusto, while director Gregory Hoblit and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau use a smoothly gliding camera and a barely perceptible visual distortion at the edges of the picture to highlight the "fractured" nature of the piece.
Only ploys to get the viewer to pick sides as easily as possible while having it end as a fairy tale to convince them that what they just watched wasn't conjured solely for the purpose of shock value - why, there's a heart too!
My only complaint is that the ending while very satisfying, also left me wanting more, i can't help but think maybe this should have been a few episodes longer.
It does this all the while without feeling disjointed, it has an elegance and clever subtly when it makes these strong transitions that makes it all the more mesmorising.
don't forget to grab episode 14, while is really doesn't have much to do with the story (you do find out a little more about Lucy's past) if you're an Elfen Lied fan its nice to watch.
"The Cry", while not a bad film, left me more confused than anything and I failed to connect with whatever the message was intended to be.
RTGM is more a socio-political statement while this film works at a very personal level.
They alone see her inner beauty, while society maligns her, yet as the director points, cannot provide the qualities of love, happiness and tranquility for members like Nandu and Anand.
And while many shows are now re-released on DVD, Raven stays in the cold for no apparent reason, at least to me.
But there's an abstract quality to all of this after a while that makes it all the more real in nature, while still keeping to a control of the subject matter into something that looks out of this world, ethereal, and somehow unnatural while still being about nature all the same (hence science-reality).
Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while.
Be still my aching ribsÂ It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing.
By this time, the world realized they had a comedic genius on their hands and after this work Wilder pretty much had the Midas Touch for a while.
It took me a while to realise but i think this movie is better then the first one.
I almost choked on my own disgust when Troy complained that he was fed up of seeing all the rich people at the Country Club while his parents were 'scraping for pennies'.
Also funny for the wrong reasons was the choreography in the song "I Don't Dance" (I know, I know; the irony of a song implying that someone don't dance while they are dancing.
Enjoy being a kid and being with the ones who love you while you still can.
One of the smartest movies to come along in a great while, it's also very funny.
As they settle in, one of them dwells on the mystery of the frozen colleague, while the other goes right to work on the monkeys.
As someone who lives in the inner-city and faces its rigors on a daily basis, I must say that Warren Beatty has unintentionally managed to illustrate exactly what a "limosine liberal" he really is -- stereotyping blacks and whites while trying to prove how "with it" an old, rich, white guy from Beverly Hills can really be.  
while this becomes a classic(10 years old already), i must say that i have seen this feature at least 5 times( not counting when seen it with company or parts of it).
while generally on same approach towards politics Bulworth does not try to justify or give an impression of naivety( how naive can really be a politician that condones war for whatever reasons!?
Highlander 2 is an example of the latter, while Devil Monster is a pretty good example of one that's just boring.
So, you have a big-screen movie turning the pages of the "National Geographic", while attempting to tell an adventure story.
On and on and on about the stupid sea lions while the stupid crew in their stupid boat looks for stupid Juan Francisco.
For instance, when Alex has kept his secretary and chauffeur waiting on the street for more than an hour while he's been in Lily's apartment, the secretary finally goes upstairs to fetch Alex.
Warren William dressed in a feather hat and pig snout singing "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf" while Ginger Rogers plays the tune on the piano.
Nonetheless, if you ever stumble upon this on TCM and have a little time to spare, it is more than worth your while, and is remarkably non-dated.
Katharine Hepburn's famous remark that Ginger gave Fred sex-appeal while he gave her class is relevant here, because Ginger is much sexier in this movie than in any of her musicals.
(In her one musical number in "Upper World", Ginger wears a revealing dress which flatters her legs while the camera ogles her at thigh height.)
Mary Astor, as always, is excellent, and brings out her character's craving for social status while keeping her human.
The thinking behind it is that a director will pull together a couple of actors everyone will recognise, a smoking hot actress everyone will like due to the range of outfits they'll get her in and then clear off to the Caribbean for a few months Â oh, and they'll be shooting a film while they're there.
What I found rather uncomfortable here is how a man (who is absolutely terrified) can be shown to be locked in a jeep while gas seeps through one of the heater vents and slowly either kills or knocks him out.
The first thing is that while the film glamorises theft and stealing, it maintains that air that everything done in this film is 'sexy'.
Salma Hayek is beautiful, and while she and Pierce Brosnan may not make the most believable couple, they do have a certain chemistry throughout the movie.
Instead of bringing a new twist to his character, he resorted to weird sex humor, skimpy bully humor, and that ever-popular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter.
Someone commenting in these pages put it better when he said that we could rehash this film, analyze it, and make it into what it was not intended to be, but the fact remains that if we had a pleasant time while we were watching, it was well worth the price of admission.
Betty Anderson (Terry Moore) is the town "fast girl" whose romantic liaisons set the community's tongues wagging, while Constance tries to fight her attraction to high school principal Mike Rossi (Lee Phillips), again afraid of history repeating itself.
Director Mark Robson would go on to direct the 1967 film version of "Valley Of The Dolls", while Peyton Place would inspire a sequel book and film, as well as a primetime soap opera from 1964 to 1967.
I've been looking forward to seeing this for a while now, as I am a fan of the novel.
Constance MacKenzie settled in this town after her husband allegedly died and is raising a daughter, Alison, while the proprietor of a dress shop.
Glossy melodrama directed by Mark Robson allows star Lana Turner to suffer nobly, playing single mother to graduating teenager Diane Varsi, harboring a skeleton in her family closet while being romanced by high school principal Lee Philips (in an appealing performance).
Constance struggles to be a good mother and community member, while rebuffing the advances of handsome school principal, Michael Rossi(Lee Philips).
And while the movie straddles the line of good taste, a plot involving the war effort and its effect on the young men of Peyton Place proves to be profound.
Selena is raped by Lucas and later she aborts the child while escaping from Lucas.
Here's another person strongly urging the release of this obscure gem on DVD, perhaps now, while it's still winter!
Theres a bit where the Spitfire pilot shoots down a jet with a grenade launcher while he hangs out of the cockpit.
A bit like Sleuth, with really only two actors in the whole film; and while it isn't in Sleuth's class, it does have a kick-ass ending of its own.
Gil Melle's synthesizer score, while dated, fits the film quite well.
(It would still be bad but at least not the kind of bad that makes you want to run off the nearest sufficiently high place, all the while screaming curses that would make a sailor blush.)
Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis's other work   Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and I'm somewhat happy about that because this movie isn't a crowning achievement for anyone , especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things   Seven out of Ten
and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion.
Many have voiced criticism over the lengthy running time, and while many have stated there were segments which could have been trimmed, I disagree.
The characters in the film resemble heavily wrapped boxes, in which Scorcese allows to be unwrapped a little at a time; all the while he displays his prowess as a Director who astonishes with this film.
He gets on Bill's good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his father's revenge.
Firuz (who possibly knew the real killer) prefer to agree the accusation of murder because he want that nobody have known his homosexuality (and his love to Kaya)so he made up a different story about the murder with the police along the movie (and the reason of the pain he felt while he was sitting on his ass is not his regret!)
and he tried to save Kaya from accusations while he was doing that.
American and Salim are afraid of the reactions of the neighborhood (because one of them is an ex-communist and a cheater while other one is a foreigner) and they are easily persuaded to hide somethings for the possibility to continue their lives in the neighborhood.
It's been a while since I've seen this film but I still remember that it is a good laugh.
it is a movie you can submerge yourself into and forget about the outside world for a while.
For once, someone had a small special effects budget, and got the most out of it, while still coming up with a compelling story.
Unfortunately while Joe is away, Drew and Shayna meet up in a bar and the inevitable happens.
Its shown repeatedly on Comedy Central, so I guess it was, but it was more along the lines of a doctor leaving a scaple inside you after an operation and laughing about it while you bleed to death internally.
It was one of my wifes video picks and while I had heard of the film I did not know much about it.
The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation.
For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.
The beginning is promising (Hopkins explaining his philosophy to reporters while using one of his contraptions), but the script goes nowhere.
It's been a while since I saw this movie, but I remember being impressed with the performances of both Fess Parker and Jeff Chandler.
Through the hypnotic rhythms of Zdenek Liska's striking score, the astronauts take part in something akin to a weird 22nd century disco, their slow somnambulistic movements reassuring while also slightly disturbing.
Vintage footage from The Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Robert Benchley and William Powell and Myrna Loy keep the laughs coming, while deeper delves into the musical archives, link this movie to it's predecessor.
It's like watching a first-year film student trying to cover the same ground an old master, Robert Altman, covered so capably in "The Player," while the student never quite understands what makes the master's film work.
This is the kind of movie that comes out every once in a while that seems to have been made for a specific purpose- to assure the people who stayed on the farm in Nebraska or wherever that they didn't miss a thing by not having moved to Los Angeles.
The narrative structure also prevents Guest from relying too heavily on cuts to b-roll sight gags that, while funny, are never more than gags.
And while Fred Willard and Jane Lynch are dealt very broad characters, their send-up of Access Hollywood is laugh-out-loud funny, and provides the perfect vehicle for Willard's boorish shtick.
This one involves Fields (as Larson E. Whipsnade) as a crooked carnival operator, being constantly pestered by Charlie McCarthy, while trying to stay one step ahead of the sheriff.
Trying to show they are "of the people" while knowing full well they are not going through life playing for free, it makes for some of the most interesting stage patter on record.
Lerner lets the fans have their say as well, including one who notes that the bands are becoming "plastic gods" while another vividly describes the festival as a "feudal court scene"--with the stars as royalty, the groupies as the courtiers and the audience as the serfs.
With this, the fight sequences become one aspect, while the real heart of the movie are the Mr. Bean like physical comedy bits where the main character tries to get respect in his everyday life.
I rented this movie at Blockbuster recently; I always rent movies instead of going to see them while in the theater.
This movie caught my eye while I was channel surfing.
The main character suffers severe injury to his head and hand from a relative fender bender, while walking away from a car accident in which the car he is in, going at full tilt down an expressway, flips over a median and land upside down hitting another car, which then causes them both to blow up within a matter of seconds...  yet he escapes unscathed...
And while I was still looking out for a conclusion that would've given the story any sense the credits started rolling by, leaving me very disappointed.
Even though I liked the way it was shown, silence while car on air, and then crash!
There's a good but all-too-brief moment with some sharks and a neat touch where the victim of a setup by the French secret service has to pay the cost of the operation but while no film that begins with Charles Berling being killed can be all bad, this pretty much manages it.
The plot is realistic and the characterization has the existential overtones the French so much love: agents doomed to obey orders and never ask questions living a lonely life of lies without any friends(while blowing up ships and routinely jumping down planes).
Broken News perhaps stays closer to the real thing while The Day Today chooses to get a bit more surreal with the stories they report.
Some say this movie rip off "The Replacements", while some say this script wrote before it.
Shirley MacLaine, a canny actress of unqualified breadth of cleverness, intuitiveness and sheer heart, has said repeatedly she has no idea if a picture is going to work or not work while she's making it.
3- Aurora's stroke while sitting at the piano with some kid.
Now adults, oldest son Tommy is in prison for drug dealing, while youngest son Teddy has become standard white trash who wants only to own a tow truck.
Juliette Lewis uses her familiar off-kilter mannerisms as Melanie, while Miranda Richardson is forced to play Patsy on two notes - petulant jealousy and benign resignation.
While Shirley McLaine remains ever the strong willed Aurora, what makes this film wonderful is the fact that she continues her relationship with her grand children much as she did with her daughter, and somewhere along the way in both movies the children come to realize that while she may make you want to bang you head against a wall, there isn't anyone that loves and supports you more!
Every once in a while he does have his shining moments, but usually his thespian abilities aren't very good.
When Jane decides to follow her fiancÃ© Tarzan (Casper Van Dien) into dangerous territory, not only Tarzan must protect the city of Opar but must protect Jane also, while trying to stop Nigel Ravens and his men.
I haven't seen this movie in maybe 18 years, but I've been searching for it all over the internet for a while now, and finally came across it tonight!
The last act of the film involves Clara struggling to find a way to break Franz's curse while dealing with Morphia's vengeful royal (b)rat, Gar.
Jenny is sexually molested and slapped around a bit while Robert watched helplessly with a knife to his throat before being knocked unconscious.
Every once in a while the plot screeches to a halt while a young woman sings (fairly well) and then two or three minutes later the plot gets back in gear.
They climb a steep hill while a terrible song called "Animals Are Clumsy Too" reminds us how humorless what's happening is.
And then the movie meanders along while the bad thing seems to go through the seven stages of grief.
Now, in an alternate universe, Rudy Valee would turn out to be the psychopathic killer, who would then proceed to stab Hooten to death and turn his pancreas into a hairnet while Baumann ran screaming into the night...but alas, this movie is nowhere near that interesting.
plays a younger, headstrong member of the outlaw gang, blinded by youthful arrogance to the danger in which they have all become enmeshed, while BrÃ©dice (NINE QUEENS) plays one of the few significant female characters in this otherwise all-male scenario, a brittle creature who falls in love with the wrong guy, with appalling consequences for everyone around her.
Spanish heartthrob Noriega forged his career in popular mainstream entries such as THESIS, OPEN YOUR EYES and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, while Sbaraglia plied his trade alongside PiÃ±eyro in the lower echelons of Argentinian cinema (TANGO FEROZ: LA LEYENDA DE TANGUITO, CABALLOS SALVAJES).
Taking a picture of him having his penis stuck in Butter's mouth while holding his thumbs up may appear perverted in THIS context...
I liked it... All the time while I was confronted with these scenes I thought "Why not?"...
Cartman has been having Butters spend the night at his house and while little Butters sleeps, Cartman does terrible things to him (like making him a mustache from cat crap, or sticking a tampon on his mouth).
The writing is genuinely funny and worth while to watch.
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
while i have not seen the true original (running approx.
Couldn't they even correct the color and contrast while they digitized it?
A resort is destroyed by an avalanche caused by a downed air craft carrying a female creature from the Ice Age(..hence her official title)who destroyed the pilot while a scientist miraculously survives.
Never have I seen such a stupid ending in a horror movie, and remember, Freddy Kreuger was killed initially because somebody didn't believe in him, while he was standing right in front of her.
The doctor plans to fly his novelty via private charter plane which was infiltrated by some money hungry mercenary type guy while in route get's frozen and kill mid flight, leaving the doctor to steer the plane in a mountain peak causing an avalanche that destroys the small skying community below.
We are also quite a while from other Bette Midler films of the 80s and as a result FTB has a stronger solo spotlight.
FOR THE BOYS is a major musical film but tapers off tune wise in the last 40 minutes while the starling and harrowing (but slightly illogical) Vietnam War scenes are played out.
To make matters worse, while the dialogue is often witty, the plot is leaden, and it promptly goes off into a host of predictable directions as it drags its characters from World War II to Vietnam in order to make a series of well-intended but extremely obvious and over-worked comments about changing times and the wastefulness of war.
As for Segal, watch his "bitter Santa Claus" scene, where he gives out Christmas gifts while swallowing a tremendous amount of bile and anger.
Set against the backdrop of wars in which the United States has been involved, the film moves from station to station as the pair entertain the boys while they bicker and fight amongst themselves.
It's a lot like pro wrestling-- it can be entertaining, in a disgusting sort of way, as long as you watch it with friends, and hopefully while inebriated.
It was okay for Jimmy Cagney (as Rocky in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES) to shoot down two "business associates", because Rocky was fair and even handed with loot - just insisting that his loot was left his loot, while those two associates (one is Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer) were just willing to cheat Rocky of his loot.
Instead, he let her to into his bedroom and wait naked while he went for a walk.
And quite the immoral lesson that leaves Jason enjoying his several hundred dollar meal without paying a cent while the restaurant owner is stiffed and left to take the loss.
My 13 year old son was almost in tears while watching this.
Flashbacks reveal his tortured relationship with his father, who died of heart failure while visiting down under.
just one step further, while all the while referring to their situation as undoubtedly a positive thing as only Locke would: "This place is different.
In the flashback, Jack's father tells him he doesn't have what it takes to cope with being a hero, while on the island, Boone more or less assumes the same out loud.
One of the more unique and creative films I've seen in a while.
the film starts with him burning himself with a candle just before shooting fire out of his penis (most likely his fantasy as he ejaculates, believe me this guy does not make the appearance of having any magical powers) the middle aged soldier spends most of his days pleasuring himself (while looking at fairy tale books, cleaning bath tubs, or spying on the daughters of his lieutenant.)
That said I'd recommend doing whatever you have to to catch this film, it's certainly one of the most original offerings I've seen in a long while and hopefully it's only the second of many to come.
Lynn manages to gain access to the baddies HQ and guided by Sue who runs all the techie stuff manages to kill the Chairman - one neat trick is too flood the building security systems with music - in this case The Carpenters Close to Me - so you end up with a kick ass Kung-Fu fight sequence set to Burt Bacharach.....which you don't see too often.... A local maverick cop(Hong at Hong - Karen Wong) is soon on their trail - things become complicated when the next hit they undertake turns into a set-up and soon the two sisters are fighting for their lives while trying not get arrested.
The sexually frustrated soldier Vendel (Csaba Czene) concerns himself with myriad masturbation techniques while watching his commanding officer's wife and daughters.
The other main characters, basically just couples (husbands & wives and soon-to-be-married folks) have nothing else to do than to basically grab every opportunity to say "I love you" to one and other (over the phone, while meeting in a hospital,...).
It's one of those movies you just might end up watching when it comes up on TV while you're 'zapping' channels and have absolutely nothing else to do.
It was unsettling for me to know that while sitting in the theater I was supposed to, in the spirit of the film, be moved by these former gangster's stories -- stories of being saved from the street by clowning.
I realize some of this is in the editing, but a 20 year old kid who takes care of his siblings while Mom is in jail until she gets her act together is quite a human being, and most of these kids come across like that.
personally i felt the character of zhao was not fully developed, while certain scenes are totally unbelievable.
So finally I think I have to advise you not to buy this game unless you don't want to have to think while playing a game and you are a blood-fetishist.
The irony is he has been secretly readying a book on how to be romantic with girls while working his day job as a tailor's assistant, back when a guy could still be a tailor's assistant.
The chase scene at the end of the movie as Lloyd attempts to "get the girl" before her marriage was quite well filmed, and the humour throughout, while not outrageous, was amusing.
I had watched this for the first time while I was in Hollywood as part of a TCM marathon of Harold Lloyd films in November 2005 (to coincide with the DVD release of New Line's 7-Disc Set).
The film displays dazzling invention throughout and is frequently hilarious, but also laces the proceedings with just the right dose of sentiment: the climactic exhilarating chase is spectacular and one of the very best of its kind, while the disruption of the marriage/abduction of the bride ending might well have inspired THE GRADUATE (1967)!
Besides, it is one of the great romantic comedies of the silent era, full of breath-taking imageries(like the scene when the Boy was dreaming about the Girl while fishing under a bridge..).
Well, the worst you have to do is bear with the subtitles; it's well worth your while.
E.g., at one point, John, a good guy, while trying to come up with a plan with rescue Billy's sister suggests using his adopted children a decoy!
It consists of two stories - Billy the Ninja has to battle some gangsters, while Gordon the Ninja has to defeat some other ninja who wants to kill every other ninja to prove he's the best.
I think this film would be best viewed while drunk.
This time, biting the bullet, I watched Groucho sing while he sold and the final chase scene with sound effects added that made it seem like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.
to Margaret Dumont, and Harpo giving Basil Ruysdael his leg while whistling a tune from the arcane musical, "Floradora."
You don't gotta sing while you sell.
Still, they shine in several scenes, most notably when Groucho first meets Grover and proceeds to insult him while simultaneously wooing Margaret Dumont with Romantic poetry.
Even while they were over at Paramount, where the 4 Brothers made their first 5 films; the young Studio Head planned on how to make the very best bit of madcap Marxian Cinematic Lunacy.
The chase scene at the end, while quite fun in its way, is hyper-extended, ill-motivated, and entirely word-free, hence a waste of their talents.
From Groucho's singing "Mr. Grover you are just a quack to me" to the end of the "Sing while you sell" reprise.
It took me a long while to rent out this film due to the fact that I suspected it to be a "in it for the money" release.
Groucho is given a schmaltzy "big musical production number" that goes on too long, is supposed to be funny and isn't, and ends up with Groucho doing little else but mugging and doing his trademark walk while other characters we're not familiar with sing the song.
I suspect while reading it that this is OK because the cultural norms to be depicted are alien and unfamiliar to a 1932 American movie audience.
Edward G. Robinson, always superb, is fine as always; at first I can't recognize Loretta Young though, while on the other hand, Leslie Fenton doesn't initially strike me as Chinese.
I've read that another of his films, Tucked In His Knuckles, has that affect on people even more -that it bugs them a good, long while afterward, but I haven't seen it yet.
I do not care for main characters getting killed, but once in a while it's okay.
Yet while this is an animated film, it is not ment for small childern however.
One of my favorite scene, is when Lynn (in the french version) jump out of the window (at the beginning) while her sister is asking her to not forget the cake.
Emma (Anne Hathaway)is the quiet and caring, while Liv (Kate Hudson) is aggressive and strong willed.
First off Liv has a lot of moral support from her fiancÃ© while Emma doesn't.
Liv is the wealthy, Ã¼ber-ambitious lawyer and naturally the less sympathetic one, while Emma is a doormat struggling to make ends meet as a middle-school teacher.
To meet the plot's dimensions, it is Liv who has the perfect boyfriend, all understanding and patience, while Emma has a live-in boyfriend who apparently has issues with her budding emancipation.
I'd rather cut off my big toes and run from Maine to Mexico non-stop while simultaneously sticking blood-sucking leaches all over my crotch.
It was because of circumstances beyond my control that I was dragged in to watch Bride Wars in the first place, and while I can't avoid admitting that I was truly, truly suffering for the first 30 minutes, I would be lying if I said the film is devoid of laughs.
You see, Liv has enjoyed some success as a lawyer while Emma is an underpaid schoolteacher, and ultimately Liv's sense of entitlement combined with Emma's decision that she's just not gonna take it anymore set up the escalating conflict that takes up the rest of the movie, but from here there's nowhere else to go except down the well-trodden path of half-assed romantic comedies.
Her annoying voice-over narration of the film aside, Candice Bergen does a decent job with her control-freak wedding planner character, while Kristen Johnston's performance as Hathaway's lousy co-worker is memorable mainly for being irritating and unfunny.
With this in mind, Bride Wars becomes an intriguing example of Hollywood's prevailing treatment of the 'wedding film' subgenre - while its premise initially suggests a critique and send up of the lavish excesses of popular weddings, the film can ultimately not avoid caving to syrupy clichÃ© and delivering an adoring treatment to the social institution it initially promised to challenge.
One scene has Kate Hudson's character lying in bed with her fiancÃ©, expressing her sorrows at how alone she feels and completely ignoring his attempts at consoling and comforting her - while a particularly insulting moment in a film chock full of them, it also demonstrates how utterly unimportant the men in the film are whatsoever.
A mail bomb, poison, hire a hit-man, poison-by-mail, or scissors to the back of the head while they were clipping wedding coupons.
Columbo wages a skilful war of nerves against this high-strung genius, and the scene where he manages to rattle him enough to cause him to make a mistake while playing chess is one of the highlights of the movie, as Harvey looks down in disbelief at the board, where he has just allowed himself to be checkmated.
For what must represent at least an hour or two of traveling the soldier is just jabbering away, while the man next to him is...well trapped, hoping this clown will just move away, leave the bus, or shut up.
During the months that they are together while she's carrying the baby it's obvious to see that they are destined to fall in love, but while it may be predictable it is just very sweet.
And for Arsenal fans like myself, while it's a blast to see the team featured in this movie, and the likes of Jose Antonio Reyes (who incidentally played for Real Madrid few weeks ago and created then scored 2 crucial goals in their final league game to hand them the La Liga title), Robert Pires and a fictional TJ featured alongside our Captain Thierry Henry (don't leave!
There are no award winning performances I have to say, but the character 'Gavin Harris' is exactly that, a character, while I can't comment on Rutger Hauer's performance as coach, but he certainly looked the part.
And while neither have been signed up for their acting skills, the same could also be said of Rutger 'The Hitcher' Hauer, who plays Real Madrid manager Rudi Van Der Merwe with all the conviction and passion of a man who's long abandoned hope of a career in Hollywood.
Still, Becker's love interest Anna Friel is fine, while the action scenes are notably more impressive than anything in Escape To Victory, not to mention St James's Park.
However, last week I happened to stumble upon the first movie while it was shown on TV and I kinda liked it, giving it an IMDb rating of 8 out of 10 stars.
Throughout the movie, the scenes of a soccer match would only occasionally appear on screen for a few minutes, while the rest was about disco clubs, parties, expensive cars, love affairs, family problems, paparazzi, filming of TV commercials... All in all, a bunch of more or less uninteresting situations already seen in numerous movies about famous musicians or film stars.
One of the girls has a crush on the female police officer, and while that's sure-fire fodder for male fantasies, it's also gratuitously voyeuristic.
And while rough around the edges, this dark little ass kicker is always surprising.
This film combined the aspects of other Blockbuster films (like PULP FICTION) and the twist is that it does this while making fun of itself.
The lead protagonist, while attempting to play someone who's tough and not afraid to die, is so pathetically thin and pale that you simply can't believe he's done time.
Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever.
The story in this film hits home harder and while it lacks the sensuality of the previous Dracula sequel, that's made up for in several other areas.
One of those movies I can't stop watching once I come across it while flipping around the channels.
And it took me a while to realize the actor playing the rustic southern mayor was David Ogden Stiers, formerly Charles Emerson Winchester of Hahvard and the 4077 MASH unit.
Every once in while a celebrity would come to town like Sally Fields (Forest Gump) raising support for a project that her brother a physics professor at UF was working on.
This combination has many comedic possibilities, and to be honest, Luc Besson managed to harness more of these, while Ben Garant merely took out most of the comedy and inserted lame American-friendly jokes which are actually very, utterly, unbelievably and desperately bad.
Heck, after a while, you even grew to like Asten--especially since he mellowed and was less of a paper-pushing bureaucrat in later episodes.
Cold Case Files is bearable (but no Quincy) while CSI is both dark & stark and far too graphic.
in both structure and spacecraft, but the limitations of the film's 21st Century setting only helps to demystify the unknown, making society much more familiar while also giving the audience an identifiable future to look into.
The difference is that the good ones work; the bad ones just confuse and strike you as phony while you're watching them.
The screenplay is unexpectedly complex, up to the point where it takes a while to figure out why someone's doing that, or why something happened.
Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi/action film that I have seen in a while, it is in the same vein as Blade Runner.
On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.
Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.
Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic.
At least after a while you feel the same agony about the hero.
plus while i'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell he did a fantastic job here and really impressed me!.
Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects.
May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that.
I made the mistake of renting this on pay-per-view while I was alone one night.
It also contains a very clichÃ© moment in which two characters want to discuss a personal matter while trying to survive.
She becomes more and more desperate for someone to believe her all the while she is being set up.
while it is true that in any conflict there are atrocities on both sides, not one of the negative commentators can refute any of the claims made in this series, they can only point out that it is one sided.
Is that worth endearing the film to this part of the audience, while, this part of the audience falls asleep?
While no match for the original Dracula by Tod Browning, Son of Dracula is, nonetheless, a much better film than its reputation suggests, and an improvement over the creaky Dracula's Daughter (a film that suffered of a bad case of "comic relief-itis", the terminal illness that killed off so many horror films of the era), which, while not totally without merit is mostly overrated.
The piece is well, conceived, written, acted and directed - imaginative and unpredictable while relatively straight-forward and highly engaging.
She must have taken a page from Bette's book while at Warner's.
while Louise is so stuck up on David she doesn't realize that her boss Mr. Graham has fallen madly in love with her and out of the clear blue sky proposes marriage to a totally surprised Louise.
The moment when he effortlessly flings the jealous Frank Stanley across the room, with a slight movement of his arm, while standing impassively, barely moving, is extremely effective.
In his inimitable style and voice inflection, Heflin has the best line in the film, which he delivers offhandedly while pacing the floor: `I'm sorry, Louise Â I seldom hit a woman, but if you don't leave me alone, I'll wind up kicking babies.'
POSSESSED is a good, soapy yarn told in flashback with some nice twists and turns, directed quite well by Curtis Bernhardt who gives the movie a moody noir feel, and while at times Louise's character can be quite unsympathetic, going from possessive to manic to moody (and more so once "David," played by Van Heflin, re-enters her life), there's a certain sorrowfulness about her inability to start again with her own life as a married woman, and thankfully Crawford is able to convey this perfectly.
One powerful sequence which shows how great an actress (as opposed to star) she would have become if given true roles and a chance to emote while expressing little is the fantasy sequence where she imagines she has killed her step-daughter (Geraldine Brooks).
Her father dies on the arrival of Alucard, and she starts sneaking around to meet with him, while her fiancÃ©e Frank follows her around.
we wouldn't want to loose focus while trying to shape and mold this masterpiece.
Come on guys you can't go on about how great your movie is while pretending to by just some unbiased fans - that's absolutely pathetic.
Most of the characters in the film are very special and at the same time you feel a connection with almost all of them, as if they were your friends telling you a personal story while you're sitting with them in a park.
She's not afraid to let the camera linger while people think and consider.
Often, after a while, they share their thoughts with her and with us.
In this film, Josie, the mother, was locked in the house while her master and his family were on long vacation.
while it is true that movie making is also dictated by economic tides, it is also important not to leave out the essential and artistic aspects of making it.
the Philippine cinema is not actually young but it seems to be doting and becoming more and more immature while many watchers have become more and more intelligent.
Instead of developing these moments, we get brief glimpses while the other 100 minutes or whatever (felt like four hours) were filled with redundant plot devices (OK, you've called each other for the sixth time and said nothing but "are the kids OK" followed by awkward silence ... we get it) and unfunny humor, which is mainly of the toilet manner (literally--the empty toilet paper roll is much funnier in the trailer than it was in the movie; Reiser and Reiner tend to keep the conversation on the subject of the "skin flute").
They finally got each other and some heartbreaking music is being played while the credits are shown.
They get separated while their kids are in a camp and remember THE STORY OF THEM.
By today's standards I suppose Son Of Dracula is none too frightening, though it nicely suggests the link between horror and everyday life, normal emotions and regional traditions, which, while this might not mean much nowadays, certainly resonated in the America of sixty years ago, which it effectively evokes.
We appreciate each other more (at least for a little while) after watching this movie.
When I finally did see it I had been married for a short time but been with my wife for a while.
The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while.
So, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film.
It is a true lesson in comic artistry while still touching the heartstrings.
Many has been written about Siodmak's choice of Lon Chaney Jr. to play the Count's descendant, but while there's no doubt that he was not the best choice for the role, he wasn't really too bad in it.
A boy 'accidentally' shoots a cop while stealing his car.
All while being pursued by his murderous, Coke-addicted friends.
You usually don't find your emotions coming out while watching other low-budget flicks, but you will here.
Steiger is hammy and O'Brien is all bluster while Cioffi is quite good.
It's been a while since I last saw this film, as a matter of fact, Pelle SvanslÃ¶s is one of the first films I saw as a child.
The acting is par, and Steven Colbert delivers the funniest performance I've seen in a long while.
The love guru tried to restore a couple while trying to find out about his own love.
Let's be honest, Ferrell's last decent leading role was in Anchorman (2004), and while he's been fine in supporting work like The Producers (2005), everything else that he's had a hand in has been a series of embarrassments of varying levels.
I suppose one thing to say about this movie is, while not exactly in a positive light, it will likely always be in your memory, never forgotten.
For his penance, I suggest that he lay off comedy for a while and do a few dramatic roles - including supporting ones - as he did (quite well) in "54."
Porky loves the house and decides to turn in while Sylvester sleeps in the kitchen.
Then there's the absurd robbery by an apparently blind man (in clear glasses, so you can see his eyes move and react), and his cohort, and evil little blonde-haired troll, who's NEVER accosted, not once, while walking directly into the power room of the bank.
I'm not even going to get into Samuel and Milla's musical interlude while she has him untied.
This is a beautifully crafted version of the play adapted from John Steinbeck's novel, and while there are fine things in it, I also find glaring faults worth pointing out as well.
In this film he is quite young and rather delicate looking, and while one can imagine that Lennie would admire him for his brains, he has no air of authority about him, no real life gravitas to ground him in reality.
But Steinbeck was hunting bigger game than this, and the tragedy he imposed on the story, while believable enough, is an awful letdown, for the viewer as much as for George.  
The film, while predictable, offers some good moments.
Samuel L Jackson delivers a worthy performance as Jack, adding his signature personality to the role while still maintaining the spirit of the character.
It still burns the hell out of me that Best Buy carries this DVD while Equilibrium was no where to be found.
I had no trouble with the dialect due to being British and having lived in Edinburgh for 5 years while I was at university.
I fear this subject matter may put some people off, but the film is about so much more than that- it's a refreshing look at young folk in Glasgow that avoids so many of the usual clichÃ©s, while it perfectly addresses the myriad people one meets in the city, and the culture shock.
Capra maybe for that or over at Twentieth Century Fox Shirley Temple could have sung some happy tunes while Bill Robinson danced with Lenny and George in the background Lenny and George being her caretakers until they find her rich relative's ranch in the San Joaquin Valley.
Most of it gives me a laugh although it gets repetitive and predictable after a while and it's not so funny.
The characters are grotesque versions of real people, which seems a good idea for comedy but after a while the level of comedy is so basic that i forget to laugh because you've seen it all before.
I watched these episodes on NetFlix and there are moments that are funny, but the comedy gets a little old after a while because of the limited number of characters.
While it's undeniably entertaining, it has all the same problems that most sketch comedy has: some characters start becoming more annoying than funny after a while, especially if they were a little annoying to begin with.
Lou and Andy are also funny at first, but after a while I get tired of the 3 minute set-up for him to predictably change his mind about what he wants.
Andy is always changing his mind, and getting up and running around while Lou's back is turned, but the joke is always funny because it is always new in some small way.
Whether nicking stuff from the supermarket or swapping her baby for a Westlife CD, Vicky Pollard reacts to any accusation with indignant outrage, while filling you in on 'this thing wot you know nu-thin' about'.
Some, though funny, just seem to lose steam after a while (such as the guy who breast feeds).
Persuaded to help her look after her fish while she has to inevitably get detained by the authorities, Dabing thought that he had reached seventh heaven when her apartment turned out to be one huge home theatre.
It is its own movie, and while episodic, it never felt disjointed or had portions out of place, but gelled together seamlessly to weave an epic adventure of the story of a young girl Ling Ling, born at an outdoor cinema, and had cinema to be her companion during her formative years.
I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did.
With all due respect to the "CP", while the two films share an early common thread of a young child with a passion for movies (with a requisite "single mom" in a small town), these two films should not really be compared side by side.
Then the girl, who seems unable to speak, asks Dabing to feed her fish while she has to stay with the police.
Dabing enters the story, at first a bully for Ling Ling but after a while they become best friends.
in fact, weÂ´ve decided to buy the video once itÂ´s out,because this will be just one of the feel-good movies one likes to see every once in a while.
On the one hand, it's a boldly intense revenge Western, while on the other, there's so much nonsense going on that with any serious scrutiny one might dismiss it as gross caricature.
Shear's direction is okay, once in a while I would notice the  shadow of a camera in an outdoor scene.
It packs a rather mean punch and while not particularly memorable, it's still pretty good entertainment.
But, after a little while it gets a little tiresome.
The biggest surprise for me while watching was how the picture confronted racism head on in the bunkhouse scene with Crooks (Leigh Whipper), talking about what it means to be a black man.
I really laughed hard when I went to see this in theatres ten years ago, and while I am smart enough to know how crude, silly, and infantile THE MOVIE ITSELF really is, I can't deny that I still laugh a lot.
The weird twist is the CRazy idea of running the pier as a ship, and takes a while to get your head round this idea, But once you do you can appreciate the film even more, If you don't well you will think the films a load of old tosh... Love it or loath it... i personally love it.. Incidentally the pier used was the Old pier at Hunstanton that was there before the eyesore they have there now, Not too far from me some lovely shots of Hunstanton as well in the film real nostalgia.
Lennie is a darn difficult role, and while Chaney at times goes over the top, he does convey the essential childlike innocence.
Aside for the technical merits (it has been rightfully noted this was a lower budget movie), the themes explored here cut to the core of what it means to be human (pursuing beauty and truth while in a POW camp), what it means to practice forgiveness when revenge is exploding within you, and what it means to love without regard to one's allegiances.
We discover that poor Lenny, while being a giant of a physical specimen,being as strong as the proverbial bull, is inflicted with a mental retardation.
The actors would have had to do three years manual labor in the jungle heat for 18 hours a day on 1,000 (or less) calorie meatless slop, while suffering dysentery, beri beri, pellagra, tropical ulcers, regular beatings and other cruelty, all the time unaware of what was happening at home or how the war was going.
5) The other characters, while a bit sugary, were quite believeable.
Jafar does so by capturing Genie, Abu and Rajah and making Iago his (hopefully temporary) master while Al, Sultan and Carpet are away.
"Boondock Saints" is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while.
The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks.
So while he's constantly running out of bullets and, lightning-quick, whipping out a new gun, the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded.
Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt.
You might find yourself asking certain questions while watching this movie.
It's so that Duffy can have ridiculous scenes where Dafoe prances around crime scenes while listening to CDs on his portable disc player as if he were conducting an orchestra instead of gathering evidence.
After a while it just becomes tiresome.
It is a sad attempt to remake the whole "cool and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion while saying cool and tough one-liners" genre.
The story centers around 2 Irish brothers (fraternal twins), who wake up while spending the night in a prison cell, and are "chosen" to take out God's vengeance on bad guys.
For some reason people can't seem to shoot each other from ten feet away, and while dangling upside-down in a room full of gangsters, these jerks kept their bearings and shot up the joint, killing almost 10 mobsters (How can they shoot so well?
I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off.
Ultimately, it does a good job of portraying a seamy side of life, while contrasting that with the kind of high society that wouldn't ordinarily connect with it.
I just finished watching The Visual Bible's "Matthew", and it will be a while until I feel "normal" again.
I loved how Jesus portrays love to all even while he is rebuking them for their wrong attitudes and self-righteousness.
It's been a while that I watched a movie were you are holding the fast forward button.
And, while Steinbeck was not one to let a sentimental moment pass by, e.g, Lennie's Christ-like innocence, inappropriate super-human strength which inadvertently wreaks havoc resulting in his euthanasia with the same instrument as used for Curley's dog, these scenes are never maudlin.
June Haver presents a beautiful life like representation of an idylic world where success occurs while life is the lie and 3rd grade words are not kept from promotion ie white lies go far.
This movie involves sixty minutes of losers from the 1970's riding around in a Winnebago while listening to some skank-hippie chick recite "The Raven" by Poe, then run into the ghosts of Confederate soldiers who lead them to the plastic Halloween candy skull of their captain.
And, while I'm always ready & eager to audition new candidates, "Night of Horror" may be -- IT.
At least while it was on screen it took my attention away from the movie.
The men aren't bad either, as while Robert Mitchum's son Christopher is a little too naive looking for my liking; he still plays his part well.
You'd be a fool to go into a cheapo seventies Italian thriller expecting a thoroughly well thought out plot; but this one veers off course a bit too often, and it can become distracting after a while.
We get get close ups of Bouchet's ass and breasts while she walks, she has a striptease scene on the hood of a car, she's lucky enough to bed Ricco and is her all around cute self.
The plot is very thin and while there's more than enough to keep the audience entertained for the time that it's on for, any longer and the film may have ended up grinding to a halt considering the thin plot line.
She plays a confident sexy woman on her own in Paris while keeping her chic Dior clothes on.
Meanwhile, Ms. Vitti also has experiences that are quite fun, such as pretending to be a reporter and becoming a groupie of a famous rock band, and she has some terribly sobering experiences, such as saving the life of an elderly man who is attempting suicide, only to have him curse her for being a rich lady who has everything while he has nothing.
The few reviews that had surfaced seemed to be polar opposites: one batch praised the film as one of the best unsung films, while the other accused the praisers of being a part of the crew and puffing up the film with false reviews and ratings.
Needless to say, this left the impression in my mind that this might not be the best film I'd seen in a while.
Seems that Yolanda killed a man a couple of years earlier who tried to attack her while she showered.
Philip Carey passes as sort of a poor man's Gary Merrill (that is to say, absolutely penniless), while Harry Townes, an even more faceless actor, makes up the roster.
Anchored by the strong central performance of Jeff Chandler(..who I'm not familiar with, which is a shame really), I really liked the thought-provoking script from Hall Bartlett, and while it does seem a bit one-sided at times, I think the themes of bringing divided groups together after a war left scars never to be fully healed and the attempt to reconcile with those you have hurt by helping the community start over are powerful enough.
This is a continuation of the first film, Legend of the Overfiend while bearing little in actual continuity (wasn't the earth being destroyed at the end of the first one?).
while I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone...I was very angry what the real Michelle had to go through.
Grant tries to hide Dunne's identity from his bride while trying to figure out what to do.
Watch him scuttle across the balcony of the house with his wife's dresses, his legs working like a marionette's while his head advances in a level line without bouncing at all.
Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous, and it remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things.
Grant "wants to go to bed" in her room, while Dunne won't let him as long as he won't forgive her.
And then there's the scene of Grant looking through women's clothing, holding them up to a mirror, while telling a doctor, "I have to go, he's waiting for me in the car!"
That's the situation facing Nick Arden (Grant), and while some men may relish the idea of having two wives, it nearly drives him insane!
Casting is excellent--you can't feel very sorry for the wronged bride or for the cheerful disappointed suitor; the kids are funny, neither sentimentalized nor smart alecky; the judge and hotel manager are gems; and Cary Grant and Irene Dunne manage to generate sparks while seeming as comfortable together as old shoes.
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
I've thought about it for a while and I came to the conclusion that it's Grant's professional training that prevents him from just confessing to one and all what's happened.
But really, one must be indulgent, critically; there is priceless stuff in this film's fibre, and while it fires not on all screwball-comedy cylinders, it is a very pleasant feature with glorious screen presences making (deceptively) light of life.
And Gowcaizer, while low on plot, certainly is enjoyable.
There's basically just a bunch of sex non-stop throughout the whole movie, including a scene where the only really attractive girl in the movie dances while a bunch of men form a circle around her and masturbate (I think they call this a "circle jerk"), but anyway, it's really dumb.
The scene of Rocco and Kennedy going at it in bed while Steele sleeps next to them is a scorcher, and the best of the film.
Half die suddenly while the other half die extremely slowly and sadly.
It offers solid character development and explores the range of human emotion while telling a story with real depth and fidelity.
And they have no trouble making 96 points while the other team still has nothing.
In most Bugs Bunny cartoons, he is pitted against a foe, usually human, while formidable in their own way, are obviously not in his league when it comes to brains.
And while the above line alone wouldn't have been sufficient to criticize, similar references to her "beauty" appeared often enough to insure this wasn't unintentional.
John Ireland seems a natural as the one guy who can and does (in some well done scenes) stand up to Queen Bee Joan, presenting his usual suppressed aversion to injustice while also straddling the fence.
Whether dangerously balancing on a balcony rail as part of his stage act, using his tremendous mouth to great advantage while telling a party story about a 'little mousie,' or engaging in impressive nightclub acrobatic stunts with The Maxellos, Joe is never less than hilarious.
Still, Francis had the last laugh; she turned in great performances even in the drek Warners gave her (while handing the plums to the new Warners queen, Bette Davis).
This also helped the movie move along, as it was nice to take the focus off the main characters every once in a while.
Susana and Carlos have been married for a while.
In apparent retaliation, the FBI director and his entourage are killed in their motorcade while on a visit to Bogota.
Fun part of this movie is how the computer kid solved the password in 5 seconds during the first part of the movie, while he was given all the personal "paper" data on the people involved and then was challenged with a serious job at the end.
Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted.
Jack Ryan discovers the whole operation while at the CIA, confronts Ritter, and then goes to Columbia to save them.
I hadn't seen Dean Jones in a while and he was fantastic!
Further, he acknowledges how ambitious officials up to and including the President can misuse the vast powers of the US military and intelligence agencies for personal and political gain while ignoring vital checks and balances of the US system.
The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.
Along with Patriot Games, this is part of an impressive set of movies which are far more entertaining than the books (perhaps thats because I'm not an avid reader) and shall keep all you viewers out there happy, if only for a short while.
The mayor's granddaughter, Clara(Charlotte Salt)is the one Mordecai has his eyes on, while also infecting the townspeople nearby with a type of mental sickness, and others with a black sludge-like substance derived from the muddy soil of the water covering Marienbad.
Mordecai needs Clara's submission while also awaiting the collapse of the poorly structured dam, built hastily 40 years prior, giving way to a massive crack running down it.Standing in Mordecai's way are Clara's mother, Teresa(Raquel MeroÃ±o), a would-be reporter returning home after a stint in London, and a recently arrived photo-journalist, Dan Quarry(Michael McKell) who is haunted by the death of his son.
Unrestrained, Yuzna doesn't seem obligated to tell a cohesive narrative instead taking Mordecai and allowing him to use his dark powers to torment and destroy through mind control while we see the black sludge turning citizens into creepy blob monsters.
I'm in college, and I listen to this movie while studying.
Forty years later, in the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of Debaria Dam, the teenager Antonio (DamiÃ  Plensa) vanishes in the lake while swimming with his girlfriend Susana (Pilar Soto) and their friend Clara Borgia (Charlotte Salt).
May & Teddy will accept a dangerous mission, entering the spirit world as if dead(..another method in the book is sleeping while dressed in burial clothes)to find Kofei..and April who has become missing as well.
Yuri then pulls the jeep on top of himself, while being gnawed on by alligators.
It seems that some time back, Tobin had stolen HER husband and now using a rather intricate plot, she diverts Tobin and Brent to her home--planning on keeping them there while secretly contacting Tobin's husband so he could come there and find his wife with another man.
I saw this a little while ago in the heyday of the "Hong Kong" craze.
Snap this film up while it's cheap and re-release it.
The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is "Sleepover" - while I like that one too, it's not anywhere near as real as this.
An overweight, fat kid who has dreams to leave his town, while constantly thinking about his Dream Girl.
Every once in a while in a horror franchise, a sequel comes along which arguably surpasses the original, as with Frankenstein/Bride of Frankenstein and Hellraiser I/II.
And when you turn off the lights, and imagine those nail less fingers stretching for your ankles, you know you won't be able to sleep easily for a while.
As the novel, this film was called "Rasen" (the spiral) and while it kept the characters from "Ringu", it followed KÃ´ji Suzuki's novel more closely than the first.
However, this move didn't bring the results the producers were expecting as while "Ringu" became a bigger hit than the novel, "Rasen" soon was destined to oblivion.
Like in the first movie, the film bases a lot of its power in the relationships between characters, and while the bond between Yoichi and Mai may not be as strong as the one with his mother in "Ringu", it is very well-developed thanks to a cleverly written screenplay.
Avoiding the mistakes of "Rasen" (that tried to give a proper scientific explanation to the Ring curse), "Ringu 2" keeps its mystery as the driving force of the film, and delivers a conclusion that, while probably less shocking than the first one, it's no less satisfactory.
The police, who are investigating the death of Reiko's father, are also looking for her, while Okazaki (YÃ»rei Yanagi), a work colleague of Reiko's, is continuing from her research on an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whoever watches it.
Takashi answers a few too many questions lingering from the first 'Ring', and while he counters this by raising almost as many (especially with the "weird science" sections in the final act), one may feel robbed of some of the first film's mystery.
First there is the belated rescue attempt of four men and a woman: the adult men's physical prowess seems suspended as if, as men, their hands are tied, while the woman casts a blinding black veil over Philip's head, halting the action, and condemning the actor.
For much of the film, the Ring curse is more or less abandoned while the focus becomes Yoichi as a surrogate villain, perhaps as "possessed" as Regan was, just by a slightly different force.
However, while the film MOMMY DEAREST was anything but subtle and was also poorly executed, this film was expertly and intricately woven.
Although Harriet bullies all three in both subtle and overt ways, the housekeeper manages to retain her self-respect, while the maid crumbles and the cousin surrenders.
Wouldn't want Walter gambling away the company money while drunk, now, would we?
She had to have been a lot more charming than Harriet and also, unlike Harriet, capable of letting down her hair once in a while and having a good time.
If Rosalind Russell had had this much focus on her in *her* version, *Craig's Wife*, it's hard to imagine if she could have sustained it, since part of Russell's strength was her ability to respond to other characters while seemingly on a course all her own.
And while the girls do spend a bit too much time drooling over the one guy in the film, they're still smart, strong-willed, and(in the case of Beverly Garland's character) vicious, as well.
I mean it is thin, of course - the entire film is about these women wandering around a swamp while getting drunk, cutting their jeans into shorts, cat fighting, etc.
I saw it so many times after that and I was enjoying it each time while I was watching it.
Naturally, over the course of their adventure the male bonding scenario results in the clerk getting in touch with his inner Rambo while the pilot learns that there's more to being a real man than just being overly aggressive and fearless.
As the villains, Kevin McCarthy (a Dante favourite) is brilliantly funny as Scrimshaw, while Fiona Lewis is very good as his man-eating deputy sidekick.
As Mr. Igoe, Vernon Wells, a.k.a, The Campiest Villain Ever (as seen in Commando), manages to be genuinely chilling and scary for the second and last time in his career as a bad guy (the first was Mad Max 2), while Robert Picardo is painfully funny as the Cowboy; on an added note, his method of seducing women in nightclubs using an imaginary lasso does NOT work in real life.
The special effects are marvellous, especially when the film takes us inside Jack's body; these moments are often breathtaking, while's there's even a lovely moment when Pendleton temporarily finds himself inside Lydia and he sees their unborn child.
So while Jack is beside himself with fears of demonic possession (he's hearing the voice of pilot Tuck Pendleton - Dennis Quaid), he is being pursued by government agencies and ruthless criminals.
Dennis Quaid makes a rugged, handsome hero while his real life wife Meg Ryan is a pretty heroine, in one of her better roles.
So the rest of the film is the group that attacked the scientist coming after Short while Quaid tries to figure out a way to get big again.
Now, this actually sounds quite intriguing to me, but there is one huge problem: The movie actually takes itself dead serious, while it on the best is a big joke.
I can also try to ignore the desperate attempts at trying to be new by putting every known western clichÃ© upside down, like the women are the strong ones kicking the guys butt, the black people are the cool dudes from da hood untouched by the slavery common a the time, while the white guys at best are stupid and pathetic cannon fodder, or at best evil and rotten to the bone.
And airing the show after Desperate Housewives was smart; while I am sure that some DH fans will not like Cashmere Mafia, I would imagine that fans of Cashmere Mafia will be viewers of DH.
I was and still am a fan of SATC and while I swear allegiance to it, I am open to something different, something new.
One thing I might say though, is that while the characters are great in their own respective story lines, they lack chemistry between each other.
And while I gave up on BS for lacking sympathetic characters (I only liked Joshua Malina's character), I think Cashmere Mafia somehow finds a way to make their leads sympathetic on top of being strong and vicious.
Basically, while I do like this show, it could be a lot better - and hopefully audiences will give it a chance!
Let's see, there are four close female friends who struggle at their private lives, while they're highly successful in their jobs:  Mia(Lucy Liu) who loses her fiancÃ© who couldn't deal with not being able to keep up with her.
Zoe (Frances O'Connor)who tries not to neglect her children, while balancing her career.
Juliet (Miranda Otto) who has to deal with a rebellious teenage daughter, while her husband has an affair.
Juliet is very similar to Bree since she is the readhead who tried to keep up appearances all the way through the pilot, while Zoe feels like a younger Lynette since she has to struggle with the same issues.
It starts a killing spree while possessing, then, it hides under Samantha Eggar's sheets (dirty hand!
Unlike in "The Bees", ZacarÃ­as really attempts this time to create an interesting horror piece, and while he unashamedly lifts some ideas from Oliver Stone's "The Hand" (released previously that same year), it could be said that he succeeds in making a somewhat original tale of horror.
The local workers start bricking themselves & refuse to enter the mine due to ancient legends about the 'Devil's Hand', soon after while in the mine together on they're own Mark & Jennifer stumble across a room with the glove shaped casket in it & Mark decides to take it.
The acting was OK & you have to consider the fact that it's very hard to convincingly fight your own hand while it's still attached to your arm, isn't it?
William himself handles the atypical seriousness of the plot perfectly and reins in his usual enjoyable hamminess, while Eric Blore provides impeccable comedy relief(his reaction to the mysterious phone caller at the beginning of the picture is hilarious--I feel that way with certain telemarketers).
To sum everything up: the inexplicably popular Hulk Hogan, washed-up can't-believe-it's-not-porno star Shannon Tweed, Apollo Creed, the cop from "Last House" (who was cool before I saw this) and some other guy who is cleaning up vomit at Wal-Mart while you read this shoot for hours and hours and hours from open spaces without getting a scratch.
The Austrian turns out to be majorly wealthy, but a foreigner so he deserves all that he gets, like having about 15 of his life guards shot while Hulk and the team rescue the little girl.
Similarly, the baddies can fire machine gun rounds after rounds at the good guys without a single hit while the good guys need one single shot to dispose of entire armies.
Shannon Tweed, the "femme fatale" jumps over a sand dune on a motorcycle while killing the baddies.
It has a fun cheesy story about fugitive women, some bad acting mixed with some `ok' acting, lots of funny dialogue and of-course, many scenes of attractive women rolling around on the ground trying to kill each other while wearing skimpy clothing.
That fact that Jim Brown, Jim Kelly, Richard Roundtree and Joe Spinell show up while the movie still sucks does.
A wounded Jim Kelly being taken to a hideout while a love song plays in the background.
Being in Europe now, yes there are obese ppl, but nothing like the "interstate buses" you see in the US, especially in the Southeastern states...  And as for consumerism, while he's touched on the subject several times the "spending money we don't have on things we don't need" is just becoming more and more evident in society!
Not one to be particularly impressed by the vast majority of so-called "great" things, it took me a while after my first viewing of Life Is Worth Losing to absorb what I had seen and several repeated viewings shortly thereafter to understand I was witnessing a truly great comedian, a genius, THE master of his craft.
But I found myself riveted to my seat while being raised to a higher level of humanity and basking in the glow of this beautiful, brilliant, dramatic woman overflowing with pride, grace, indefatigability, anger, compassion, and clear-eyed philosophy --and prone to outrageous laughter.

A group of sailors experience all sorts of events while on the SS Glencairn.
This showed how lonely these sailors became while on board for such an extended period of time.
Two sailors, Smitty and Yank died while on board of Glencairn and Drisk died at the end when he was aboard Amindra and it got torpedoed.
Ian Hunter is not a well-known actor today, but he carries the film as long as he's around, especially while confronted with his apparent treachery.
John Ford is pretty much the Shakespeare of cinema, effortlessly moving from comedy to tragedy within a single scene, and "Long Voyage Home," while not perfect, makes a strong case for his visionary mastery.
The script of A STUDY IN SCARLET was extremely polished and well-constructed, developing at just the right pace while carefully building the appropriate mood and environment.
For instance, the killer is kept unseen, while at the same time menace is suggested by having the crimes viewed through the murderer's eyes using a subjective camera.
A while ago I saw new Discovery show "Project Earth" with lamebrain ideas to stop global warming and prognoses that anyone can question.
Nowadays the average Rothrock fight scene looks very conventional, while of course still remaining sexy by the sheer fact she is kicking booty.
Rothrock is superb in the action department and has some great fights, amongst others a great fight with Biao, while Biao is also superb, showcasing some amazing moves and great stunts.
The plot deals with a lawyer becoming a vigilante while running afoul of Cynthia Rothrock.
In general, the sex scenes, while explicit, are very short.
A couple of guys find the girl and decide to help her, by raping her while unconscious.
Personally, I think that while some of his other movies might be more impressive on a purely sexual scale (the now extremely hard to locate FEMMES DE SADE in particular) this one surely stands as his best combination of hardcore sex with a honest to goodness light 'n' breezy bit o'plot.
Racism and the implications of being in charge: those are the two key topics of this suspenseful Trek tale, and both are handled admirably thanks to the writers' focus on the tense relationship between the half-alien Spock and the entirely "human" crew under his command, while William Shatner is elegantly sidelined as far as the drama is concerned.
A shuttle craft crew gets stranded on a hostile planet, and they must find a way to lift off again while dangerous creatures lay siege.
Kirk, meanwhile, fends off an annoying bureaucrat, a 'high commissioner,' on his bridge while attempting to locate his missing crew members without the usual instrumentation (ion storms, you know).
It is something to see that there were no cell phones and no internet information superhighway while the show was on.
I am a European and white and feel that this story / these stories, while Native American in origin and tradition, have something of enormous value to teach all of us.
I was lucky enough to flip past it just at the begining while I was waiting for my friend to get ready for a party we were supposed to go to.
In what could be her best performance for a good while Coleman is spot on as the enigmatic, sexy and streetwise Tiffany who, together with her nine year old son and his gay bosnian babysitter, help Virgil Guppy get his life back.
This movie, while accurate, is the most disturbing piece of cinematography on autism that I've ever seen.
One, our protagonist, is Thomas while the other is his autistic brother Charlie.
Toni Collette is a professional actress like always, while Gemma Wark seem s bit too exotic of a flower for this type of environment.
Written and directed by Elissa Down, who has two autistic brothers in real life, obviously brings her experiences to bear and is innately able to bring pressure to this trouble torn family while bringing out some very emotional love.
How about if someone walks into your house, your bathroom, while your daughter is taking a shower.
It's interesting to note that while Thomas sees Charlie as a burden, his formal introduction to Jackie and the development of their relationship has much to do with his brother.
A pathetic excuse for seeing a lot of naked girls, this Fred Olen Ray apocriph production is a lesbian feast, with several almost always naked female ghosts doing a lot of two-some, three-some and four-some while a team of reporters shoots a documentary on them.
Julie Strain appears only in two erotic scenes (both with the porcelain twins, a couple of blondes resembling - but only for the face, as she as definitely better boobs - Italian pornstar Selen), while in the other five you have a couple each with Aria Giovanni (another goddess of this kind of movies), Mia Zottoli (also known as Ava Lake), Felony and Nicole Specht.
I feel this is where quirky director Wes Anderson excels: being able to march to the beat of his own drummer while getting others on board with him.
on the trip and intent on staying on schedule, all the while it's all a plan for the three of them to reunite with their mother who abandoned them after their father died (not even attending the funeral) to be some nun in a quasi church/ashram/temple/somethingorother.
Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film.
With Wes, I want him to just continue what he's been doing: keep using his same awesome style while taking baby steps of progress.
Three good actors in three-well written roles in an open, exciting and unpredictable environment, while they're also stuck with each other in a cramped an uncomfortable train carriage.
He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.
I was 10, hiding under the dining table, while my parents thought I was asleep, I was watching Oh!
Margaret decides to keep the farce of their social position secretly cooking the dinner, while the clumsy Irwin justifies her absence telling the bishop Soper that she had just traveled to the country to meet some friends.
Now, she's also cast as an understudy (or as they call it here, apprentice) in a play, and somehow the star dies, horribly, while sitting right there in the midst of her fellow actors.
I find myself asking the same questions as I would while watching a reality show.
So we went and saw the movie underaged and followed it with that cult-like devotion, for a while it seemed every afflicted night would end with us trying to or finding the house, etc etc.
From the very beginning I was drawn in, as much as one can be when someone is fornicating with Sarah Michelle Gellar while playing music from multiple boom boxes and smoking a blunt.
The ending, while it may anger some, leaves a bit up to interpretation, unless of course you do about 3 minutes of research on LSD and Thorazine.
It's full of sex, drugs, hip-hop and classical music (Grenier has both playing while he and Gellar get it on in the film's opening scene).
The movie diverges from the derivative plot once in a while just to throw the audience tidbits of gore or sexuality, all of which are pretty lack luster, and will fail to thrill experienced horror watchers.
How could anyone vote for a party that wants to "Spread the wealth around"  If everyone had to wake up at 6 in the morning and put in 8 hours of work, let's go "Spread the wealth around" When I and maybe 30 million people like I go to work on a Friday that has to hold up this economy, while a majority of the rest of the country sits on their butts and does nothing and has more children.
Moore says bring back the troops, kick out bush for a while to a cheering audience, it shows a random musical guest or celebrity then it shows a news caster talking about what the polls show to give a little time effect.
After the first victim is killed while seated at the table the rest of the guests flee for their lives in a spontaneous and morbid game of hide-and-seek.
They scatter in all directions hiding from the blood-thirsty matrons while searching for escape from the locked-down manor they're trapped in.
I've been wanting to watch this film for quite a while now.
One aunt is giving him the opportunity to off himself, while the other is telling him to fight for his life.
I forgot that I was watching a movie for a while & became incredibly angered far more times than once.
The film depicts Victorian society as a benevolent sanctuary for a man, who while given the props to model himself after the normality he aspires to, is never deceived into thinking he can achieve it beyond his imagination.
Bytes spins a tale of a terrifying encounter between woman and elephant while Treeves stares, mouth agape.
The costume and production design authentically breathe life into the Victorian era while Freddie Francis' expressionistic monochrome adds both verisimilitude and a sense of an alternative world.
I think Spaghetti westerns lack believability, you know the good guy is never gonna die, while in this show the good guy takes a beating and loses at the end but wins as well.
The black man, the Native American woman, the Mexicans, the Anglos, and then the rancher's not so faithful mistress, give this movie a lot of great subplots to think about, but the central story of Valdez first asking and then demanding money for the dead man's woman is simple yet effective as it draws out into chases and ambushes while revealing the characters for who they really are.
Burt LancasterÂat that time 57 years oldÂin fact dominates the film by a mystic presence, rather than actually being on screen for any length of timeÂ  The bulk of the film constitutes a battle of wits and guns between Valdez and an extremely stubborn leader of a band of trigger-happy gun-slingersÂ   So when Frank Tanner (John Cypher) provokes a shoot-out which results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez asks $100 compensation from Tanner to provide financial support for his pregnant widowÂ Tanner not only refuses, but humiliates Valdez and orders his hired gunmen to beat him hardly, to tie him to a cross, and to drive him out of his placeÂ   Again Spain locations represented the American frontier for this revenge tale about an aging former cavalry man who dusts off his old uniform, straps on his old guns, takes plenty of ammunition, and erupt a one-man army against a greedy, rotten, evil rancher and his henchmen to enforce justice at any costÂ  As the pursuers forge deeper into the wilderness, the situation shifts around with hunters becoming the huntedÂ  Susan Clark (Gay) sides with Valdez without falling in love with him, while Barton Heyman (playing the chief henchman "El Segundo") provides his character with warmth and quality at a pivotal timeÂ
while watching a guest being eaten.
The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits.
I can safely say that movies like this are much better while you're watching them, but what are movies for?
The ending, while it may seem corny too some, and is, by all means, a bit of a typical Hollywood ending(some might even call it a cop-out), but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have.
It has been such a long time since a movie was made that warmed your heart, while keeping you at the edge of your seat.
That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human?
I haven't seen it in a while.
But while working there they go through some rough times..... but together as a family they get through it!
I thought this would be the worth movie ever but I think it is extraordinary.This is a must see.It is about two spoiled girls who burn the kitchen and they have to take a summer job at there dad"s dairy factory, while he goes on vacation,but the sisters run into a lot of problems and they need to find the solution together.I liked the story,the acting was great and the best part is that I can watch this over and over again,not like a lot of movies.I also like the way the sisters realize that they need to think about other people not just themselves.so this is my conclusion:see this movie,if you like Disney,vote on it,comment.that is what I think of this outstanding movie
In turn, she develops a severe cash of sunburn which forces her to stay inside the hotel room, while a joyous Lenny is free to pursue other things - like courting the beautiful and seductive Kelly (played by Cybill Shepard).
Just look at her face filled with cream to cover that sun-burn that keeps her locked up in the room while Grodin cavorts with his love.
The fact that Lenny may never have seen a WASP like Kelly while growing up in the city is hardly an excuse for his actions, and Berlin's character is hardly a stereotypical (repugnant, overindulged) Jewish American Princess.
Suddenly, anything Lila does (almost nothing Lenny shouldn't have noticed while dating) is distasteful to her groom.
The lead duo I thought were superb, and you can tell while watching the film they were enjoying themselves.
Then I laughed again, while I was crying.
It really made me go through so many emotions while watching, I laughed, I almost cried (which is a hard feat to conquer in and of itself), and I left with that warm and fuzzy feeling, and wanting to see it again right after.
The dialog was fresh and edgy, and it was the first film that I have seen in a while that felt like it was written and directed by real people, and not vetted by a series of industry drones.
After all, we all learned in grade school not to judge a book by its cover, but maybe the simplest lessons need to be revisited every once in a while.
Priestly is a nice change of pace because he is allowed to embrace his comedic talent while portraying his most normal and well-adjusted character yet, despite the character's outward appearance.
Shue, the mother, blames Leo, (Fiennes) the rest of his life which leads him to murder and prison while trying to save his mother's life.
It's a cold picture of child abuse and neglect of a smart intelligent kid longing to be loved while always trying to do the right thing, no matter the consequence.
Powell escaped while being transported to San Quentin to be hung for murder.
Knowing the sergeant can't swim, Hardesty, handcuffed to him, jumps overboard and, while trying to drown Burke, steals the handcuff key and frees himself.
Upper class sophistication, personified by ever-glamorous Kay Francis and gentleman crook William Powell, characterizes the tragic aspect of the story, while ethic warmth and humor, in the classic Warner Bros. style, are perfectly supplied by Aline MacMahon, Warren Hymer, and Frank McHugh.
Sadly, after this and "Jewel Robbery", Powell and Francis were never paired again; Powell went onto MGM where better things awaited him, while Francis remained at Warners for many similar films, none of which could surpass the charm of this film.
Fellini even had a Jungian analyst on the set while shooting.
Now, while these picaresque episodes are indeed exotic, weird and funny, it is Fellini's vision that makes this film unique viewing.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
Moreover, Lowe makes for a refreshingly wimpy and reluctant hero while Swanson registers strongly as a very fair and appealing maiden in distress.
I first learned of the film while studying Latin and therefore was aware of the fractured nature of the original work and was prepared for the same in the movie, and while some of the action is provocative a fair amount of screen time is just, well, rather dull--its hard to follow and has no translation to modern times or sentiments, still through all the meandering there are moments--moments that are visually stunning, inspire awe, and feel like nothing from this world.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
While not strictly faithful to the book and while sort of splicing certain events together and introducing some new scenes, this movie is actually pretty close in spirit to the book and as such, as I said, unique and really able to constitute its own genre.
To appreciate this movie, you just have to suspend your beliefs for a while and watching this gorgeous movie unfold.
Encolpio and Ascilto then wander into the aristocratic home of a husband and wife who've just freed their slaves and committed suicide through bleeding themselves to death (a symbol of the death of aristocracy while the nouveau riche are getting fat?).
Encolpio refuses the deal, while a group of greedy Roman dignitaries are shown chewing on what must obviously be the dead poet's tough old flesh, looking like so many fat cows chewing on their cuds.
Sadako's mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
The film features a young man named Encolpio and his sometime friend Ascilto; both of whom seem to prefer participatory experience as a means to finding meaning in life while primarily disregarding status, power and possessions.
Something to while away the time.
Though the episodic tale of Pitt's Benjamin growing younger while Blanchett's Daisy grows older spans the globe from Manhattan to Russia to Paris, the characters' hearts remain united in New Orleans.
Also, while Brad Pitt is gorgeous to look at, and a very likable movie star, his performance somehow left me a little cold - it doesn't hit any deep emotional chords, and while you could praise him for being subtle, he just doesn't have the everyman quality, that sense of human anguish anyone can relate to, that someone like Will Smith does.
Brad Pitt plays the role in a disarmingly quiet mode, while Cate Blanchett and Tarij P Henson go overboard.
Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it.
Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark.
He gets a job handed to him while sitting on a bench (a job that he loves so much that he would have done it for free, but he's getting paid!).
Neither one has to deal with any sort of conflict for a while.
Spoiler - Benjamin Button had one effect, that was make-up: Take one of the world's most attractive men and make him look unattractive for 75% of the film, while he moans and groans about the deal he's been dealt in life.
That would actually make him a great father... he'd be around for the same number of years as many fathers are for their children.. 30/40 years, and during that time he'd only have gotten stronger and younger, while his mind was still maturing.
But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough).
The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within.
Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely.
Lacey Chabert and Nick Cornish have a good on screen chemistry, while Terry O'Quinn is perfect as the perfectionist coach.
The decide to follow through a secondary road, and while fueling their car in "Sam's Last Chance" gas station, they are advised by the owner and attendant Sam (Richard Farnsworth) to not sleep after the second tree in the road.
You just feel sorry for the actors, technicians and investors while you're miffed at the directors and producers.
You know, I think I'll watch it tonight...haven't seen it in a while.
Oh yeah, this is a great movie to "drink along with", while you laugh out loud.
The superb action sequences are split up by good plot detail and a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, a lot of it completely incongruous to the often violent scenario (the sequence with Yun-Fat dodging bullets while holding a baby for example).
The sheer volume of gunfire does become wallpaper after a while, but fans of hardcore action will not be disappointed.
Fatt is his usual stalwart self, while Anthony Wong and Philip Kwok (who steals the show as Mad Dog) are sublime.
The opening scene with the shoot-out at the teahouse is remembered for when Tequila (Yun Fat Chow) does a bunch of insane stunts like firing while jumping in mid-air and when he slides down the staircase handle and shoots the bad guys without getting hit.
And in that shot Tequila and Tony shoot every bad guy in sight and while talking some emotional lines, I've never seen such a masterful shot like that until "Children of Men".
And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.
However his boss is constantly pushing him over the edge and he has to deal with while disobeying orders to get to the Triads.
But unfortunately the gang leader shows up and decides to kill them all and the eye-patch guy basically dies while standing up for what he believes is right that only the violent people should die.
Chow Yun-Fat's status as an action hero is immortalized here in his performance as super cop Tequila, who dodges bullets and shoot crooks while cooing a baby to sleep and covering his eyes from the ensuing violence.
Slow-motion highlights bullets, explosions, and plaster and sparks flying every which way, even as the actors and stunt men acrobatically move through the air while evading enemy fire.
While most modern action films (Smokin' Aces for one) aspire to some sort of grand intelligence while providing shoot-outs and explosions, this film is a reminder of times when action films suffered no such pretensions.
The puzzles are mostly logic based, and while some require inventory items that can be a little non-logical to come by, it didn't takeaway from the experience, but rather enhanced it for the most part.
Stark portrays the world as we know it perfectly, while in Arcadia is a mystical right out of fairy-tales - so amazing yet believable.
Later, the real "Battling Butler," to do the impostor a favor and save his marriage, lets him be the real thing and fight while he retires.
It definitely takes a while to get up to speed (at the start, I took the father to be a doctor giving his sickly son only three months to live!)
Then an immature Keith throws a television out of the hotel window, while being egged on by his professional entourage.
If nothing else, the film lets the fan into the eye of the storm; the band's onstage performances are repeatedly set in contrast with their travelling constraints, while around them both the media and the public continually orbit in a veritable feeding frenzy.
The kook, nearly suicidal fan, whose baby's been taken away due to mom's acid habit, the primitive and forceful disrobing of women on the plane while the band cooks up a beat to go with it, and the junky sound man all create a subterrainian truthful texture to the Stones experience that was most likely not available to the Maysles brothers.
The film has a typical Italian-American guy named JR (Harvey Keitel, also his first film along with Scorsese's) who falls in love with a nice girl (Zina Bethune), and the film shows they're relationship, while JR hangs with his friends, contemplating his life.
It did seem heavy handed and forced after a while, and I remember how a 1957 TV Western broached the subject much more effectively without getting in your face.
For example, the scene in which J.R. and The Girl first meet on the ferry is nearly done in one take, with only two or three cuts (an effective overheard shot as Keitel changes positions being the best) while the camera pans back and forth as they have their conversation on the films of John Wayne, French magazines and language, and so forth.
But the 70 minutes does amount to an effective little suspenser, as assassins and hostages crowd into a living room perch awaiting the president's sitting-duck arrival, while the tension mounts.
It might be gritty but only because characters say things like " Ah'm thru wid chew you motherf--kin' ho " while the drama elements never come to the fore .
If only cartoon Channel re-ran the REAL old classics...  And while we're at it, I'll throw in a comment about "Hot Wheels."
Jeb never quite assimilates into his foster family: he fights constantly with Adam, who sees him as an interloper, while he and Thorley (Teresa Wright) develop a very un-sibling-like attachment.
Her declaration, and the wedding night itself, are like a soprano's arias, while the scene in which Jeb courts Thorley has a sick, chilling quality, as they act out a polite mockery of their former innocent romance.
I saw this movie while in college in 1975.
I cant remember if I watched 5 or 6 seasons,but I do remember that I thought the series was very funny for a while,but then it became a little more confusing and darker (I liked the first computer best),I don't know if its just me but I felt it was almost depressing watching the later seasons.
they are soon put to war by Rimmer who takes charge of the heroes while a wax Hitler takes charge of the villains, Also Ace Rimmer, a more likable Rimmer, arrives from another Dimension.
It's amazing the original Red Dwarf ever circumvented it while conforming to it.
From then on, they spend their times together, while Holly steers them all home, back to Earth.
It stops being a bunch of geeks and losers romping aimlessly around the universe; Kochanski is smart and gives the show direction, while the writers seem to be trying to fit a storyline to the randomness of the first 5 seasons.
Anyway, as the series progresses he is one of the best walls to bounce jokes with between him and Lister, and while they are always fighting deep down they both don't hate each other and Lister is actually quite understanding of the fact that Rimmer is a complete and utter Smeghead.
It was great while it lasted, but the idea ran its course.
Ironically, Sinatra's character presents himself as a "war hero," while Sinatra was 4-F during World War II and Sterling Hayden served with the United States Marine Corps and received the Silver Star for his gallantry in the European theatre.
This was the first time I saw that movie, but I'll comment while the good impression still there.
The dramatic action theme is way above par, while the physical confrontational scenes and special effects are incredible.
And, while SPIN VFX is no WETA or ILM, their work was great enough that I didn't miss them (although the baby Moorwen wasn't as good as the big one).
I thought the film was great, really cool genre pic that comes across as a nice mixture of Predator/Braveheart/Beowulf, all the while managing to feel quite original on its own.
Along the way, there are quite a few sight gags, including one which kept the short from being seen in its entirety for quite a while.
I have heard about this show for a while and one day, I decided to watch some episodes of My Super Sweet 16.
At least, however, Sinatra could still do dramatic roles while being a hero (like Detective Tony Rome, or "Von" Ryan), but he stymied a section of his acting development.
Although Teddy Roosevelt was wounded in 1912 while campaigning, and FDR shot at (and Mayor Cermak of Chicago killed) in 1933 those events were long past.
Kim Charney, like many child actors who find themselves in major roles, subsides on cuteness and pathos while delivering his lines with a grating sincerity.
This is reality television at it's finest - excess while the looker-ons are judge and jury.
Given a lean 88-minute running-time, it's no surprise the plot is so thin and obvious (virtually recreating all the highlights from the first two Universal shark flicks Â however, while characterization was a strong element, in JAWS at least, the scriptwriters here lazily resort to mere stereotypes).
; some of these were genuinely unsettling, to be sure Â but, while this practice may be forgiven when viewed in excessively dark prints (as some online reviewers have complained), it wasn't in the surprisingly clean edition that I came across only recentlyÂ   James Franciscus has the lead role here; for the record, he had played a villain in another Italian JAWS rip-off Â or, more specifically, PIRANHA (1978) Â i.e.
Mind you, the film is hugely enjoyable while it's on (albeit unintentionally so for the most part) Â right down from the very opening scene, accompanied by the cheesiest song imaginable, of a surfer trying out some impossibly intricate moves until the shark takes a bite out of his board.
)Âwhile the explosive ending was replicated wholesale into the official third JAWS entry (THE LAST SHARK was actually released as part of the series in Spain!).
But while those films only copied certain elements of Jaws, the Italian low-budget horror film Great White ripped-off nearly every single element.
The music, while blown out of proportion at times, is intricate.
The daughter straps him down and administers high electric voltage through his forehead, while the mother rides his convulsing pelvis and then proceeds to cool him down with a golden shower.
I watched the movie with the default 'new' subtitles and while the content was good, they cover up a LOT of the movie.
however, while I like his movies, nothing comes close to the beauty, acting, photography, atmosphere and sheer stomach turning quality of this work of art.
It's been a while since I've seen a good bizarre flick like this, it's right up there with Visitor Q and Penetration Angst.
He is nicknamed "Singapore Sling" by the pair, is tied to a bed, and is humiliated in various ways (one particularly interesting one being when the Mother urinates in his face while administering electroshock.)
After a while, the film just kinda drifts off the deep end, as if it wasn't strange enough already...illustrative of this are the famous "dinner scenes", which have to be the most memorable parts in the movie, and the Daughter furiously ramming a kiwi into her vagina.
Singapore enters the picture when he goes poking around the womens' house looking for a woman named Laura who he encountered a while back and has become obsessed with.
The duo then hold the injured Singapore hostage in their home, while pretty much just trying to make him go nuts.
The movie goes like this for quite a while, just the viewer getting to know these ladies.
"Singapore Sling" is shot in exquisite black-and-white and classical music plays on the soundtrack and this makes it even more unsettling.In one truly demented scene the male lead is tied down to the bed, ETC paddles jammed against his forehead and he is left convulsing in shock while the mother rides him and then moves up to urinate on his face.So if you are a fan of twisted cinema like "Visitor Q","Salo" or "Sweet Movie" give this gross-out masterpiece a look.10 out of 10.
That is the question I asked myself numerous times while watching this mess of an exploit film.
These three hours feature subtle romance, elegant action sequences that showcase the Chinese approach to psychological and strategic warfare, while yet serving as a poignant statement about the horror of war and the possibility of redemption.
He is having a writer's block while writing his second.
Also, I would say that this is a game where you have to expect that you may need to spend time finding yourself more minerals... or making what you get last a while.
Trying to build your base and protect it while building an army for war is a fun challenge.
This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other.
However I must admit the resolution to "Steel Trap" while it's very simple, is still very good, and very sinister, and for me pretty much made up almost any problem I had with it, to where it is no big deal.
Watching Terry Kiser crack horribly lame one liners while murdering a comatose teenage boy is like viewing a Carol Burnett skit from hell.
I wasn't really bored while watching this film, but it is supremely forgettable.
I did not see anything THAT bad about this movie, because while it is cheesy and overrated in some scenes, it's total fun and a complete delight.
I am discovering Kurosawa's pre-Rashomon films on TCM while I am approaching old age.
This film has shown me that Kurosawa has tried and excelled in positively every genre imaginable while preceding others in each field.
"One Wonderful Sunday" has probably taught a few things to Fellini while totally preempting the French New Wave.
Anyway, while they're all trapped in the elevator, Luchino does the usual Japanese school girl violence thing (that is, if you've watched a lot of Japanese movies) and it's not pretty either.
Even the mild mannered people in the elevator have strange background stories that while all we get is a glimpse, its very cool and explains why they act the way they do.
Overall Score (Not an average): 8 - Previews of this movie definitely got me interested and its been a good while since something totally new and different came along.
Dodos argues that ID succeeds in the public arena because it tells a simple story, while the truth is much more complex.
It criticizes the ID side for using catchphrases, while repeating catchphrases of the Darwinist side- such as 'God of the gaps".
This film comes off as arrogantly insulting those who believe in intelligent design ("ID") itself, and it fails to get across the most important point that, even if you are pro-ID, while your views are arguably worthy of respect as a philosophical matter, you can't reasonably believe that your ID philosophy ought to be taught in science class.
I had to wince once in a while as the auteur explained that his father was a graduate of West Point in "the year of heroes" and his mother ("Muffy Moose") was a relative of General George C. Marshall or somebody and they both knew General Douglas MacArthur on Corregidor and -- well, and so forth.
Robin Williams dominates this movie and is brilliant as usual in the endearing, sympathetic role of the kind Jakob who must try to balance getting out lots of hopeful (if fictitious) war reports to keep spirits up while at the same time avoid Nazi suspicion and detection.
Sometimes, he frequents a local nightclub, but most nights, he reads while the sexual moans of his neighbor Lori (Eugenia Yuan) seep into his Silver Lake apartment.
Postcoital, her hunky boyfriend Justin (Matt Westmore) sleeps while Lori tiptoes upstairs to watch a movie with Michael.
A while later in the film, we see that Sadako is actually warring desperately with herself .
To Michael's flat to cuddle with him very platonically while they watch movies on TV into the wee hours.
You recognize her voice more than her face and it takes a while because you are struggling internally with disbelief, like if Emma Thompson had made an appearance in "The New Guy".
In short, this movie manages to be misogynistic and demeaning while supposedly championing feminist impulses.
Pseudo-rapes are eroticized to pander to hormonal audiences, while consensual sex is mostly portrayed as degrading.
You see a quite capable SWAT-team slowly getting decimated all the while hunting a psychotic killer who seems to be constantly hiring new thugs for support too.
All the while the composer is writing his ridiculous score, full of innocent mountain maids and singing crickets.
The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing, while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat.
Whether trying to sell mousetraps to suspicious Swiss, or attempting to move a heavy piano across a most vertiginous swinging bridge (while being hampered by a gorilla), they are never anything less than magnificent - the sweetly innocent visitors from a zany parallel universe all their own.
Greg Proops did news flash once in a while instead of Colin all the time, and I loved the game Helping Hands.
D'Amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film-making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2,000-year-old catacomb.
And while D'Amato's staple was erotica, the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time, late night Cinemax... One problem... Joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica, even mixed in his gore films.
This is really one of the better constructed movies I've seen in a while.
You can thank me later while you pay homage to a comedy legend if there ever was one.
Catch this Legend in action while you still can NO one comes close I guarantee you!
He also covers completely unrelated topics such as dogs, drugs, family life, boxing, and sex... all the while being hysterically funny.
The sets are beautiful, but it's so dark and gloomy, and after a while you start missing daylight.
So while there is stuff I love, like the scene with the grenades, the movie as a whole failed to connect with me on any sort of intellectual or emotional level.
Tok escapes on a stolen motorcycle while a police station explodes in the background.
Now while some call that a blatant bootleg or hijacking of John Woo's style, I call it a pleasant revisit.
This is one of the better Hong-Kong bullet fest to be released in a while.
In one scene, an unarmed man is executed while the narrator discusses abuses committed by UN forces.
This film basically took the same approach as "Animaniacs", making the humor appealing to kids, while at the same time adding an element of satire, to appeal to the older generation.
Also absent was the choice of "light" and "mega" that was present in other games, because playing on lite first for a little while might have been helpful for "getting used" to the game before really going for it.
And it was too bad that Murray, the talking skull, was only present for a little while and didn't have as big a part as in the third one.
This "Tarzan" variation has losing coach John Amos (as Sam Archer) finding "The World's Greatest Athlete" in the form of loin-clothed Jan-Michael Vincent (as Nanu), while on safari in Africa, with sidekick Tim Conway (as Milo Jackson).
I haven't seen the film in a while (that is a good thing) but can remember the basic outline of the plot and story.
It takes a while to get going, and even once it does nothing cool ever happens until the finale, which involves yet another spider, this one bigger than a large sports car, getting loose in Los Angles.
I have only seen it repeated once since then,and that was several years ago while living here (in New York).
Someone asked me at a job interview who my most influential person and I said Jacquelyn Helton because she had the courage to do what she thought was right all the while knowing what the outcome would be.
Katzenberg at the time was suing Eisner (Disney) for money he felt he was owed while working at Disney.
They didn't hire a crew to come in and apply a dozen coats of paint and polish it to a glass-like shine -- while that result is appealing and good, there is also merit in an artwork that is deemed "finished" by the artist but for which the audience knows it could be done differently.
Lloyd Kaufman personally recommended this film to me because I said that my favorite filmmaker was Jodorowsky -- and while this isn't really anything like Jodorowsky, it is still absolutely genius and is essential viewing for anyone interested at all in "avant-garde cinema".
With a lifetime of experience, soulfulness and passion which infused life into your many characters, one would have thought directing a film is something you could even do while you are sleeping!
He is one of the very few actors in Indian cinema who has succeeded in bridging the lamentable divide that exists between 'sensible'(read realistic) and 'glamour'(songs and dances and fight sequences by the dozen peppered with rain dances/bathing beauties played out by the heroine/vamp in skimpy costumes out to titillate the viewers while walking the thin red line between the 'acceptable' and 'obscene', based on the notoriously arbitrary censorship laws in India) cinema during the 80s and early 90s.
That's why it makes me so happy when, once in a long while, i get to see a movie like this one.
The acting is horrid, while the cast is simply reciting lines with little feeling.
So he seeks a master at a Kung Fu gym and is treated ruelly for a while, until he meets another master (a drunken old vagabond in the woods), and suddenly starts to show some promise.
When Nick steals a hundred dollars from Morton while away on a fishing trip, the attorney's response is to 'jackroll' the kid in an alley back in the city, while both are on dates with their gals.
* So-called 'hilarious' buddy talk between The Jerk and his mates that reads like it was written by a 18 year old college dropout while sitting on the toilet (example: after the above stuntman emerges from the lake, The Jerk comments "Well, guess his ass is toast!!"
I never thought that anyone could give a bad performance under Ray's direction, but while Farley Granger was no Montgomery Clift, John Derek is a dime-store version of Granger; at least Granger was able to give a sensitive and genuinely compelling performance under Ray's fatherly direction.
But conflict they do, because the slum scenes bring out the expressive artistry of director Ray, while the high-key lighting and prolonged dialog of the court resemble the boilerplate of the old Perry Mason show.
At least, Bogart and Ray were able to recover the following year with the artistically complete "In a Lonely Place" (1950), while Derek found a comfortable niche adorning a number of forgettable costume dramas.
Humphrey Bogart stars in this rather uneven courtroom, flashback-dominated drama as a good-hearted defense attorney standing up for a young man (John Derek) accused of shooting a police officer dead while making an escape attempt.
How this man accused of murder and facing the death penalty became the man he is, the sort of things he'd gone through, and all the while, trying to prove his innocence.
I watched The Trial of the Incredible Hulk on TV a while ago and I actually liked it, I've seen it three times now.
The film sees David Banner moving from another place again and heads to New York for a place to stay while trying to find a way to stop the transformations, meanwhile a diamond heist is done and two of the thieves go on a train with Banner on, one of them decides to rape the young women on the train and after attacking Daivd he changes and attacks them both then runs off and changes to Banner but the police find him and arrest him thinking he did it.
What really bums me out about this movie is the fact that Banner doesn't even Hulkout for the final showdown while Daredevil takes on Wilson Fisk.
The theme of this episode is living in the moment and while this installment of the series isn't as weird or unpredictable as most, it manages to work well because of the nice leisurely pace that was created by Aherne.
I thought Dillman has a startlingly good scene where he admits to who he really is and the hoax that has put them all in grave danger..I think Dillman realistically displays the emotional weight his character is bearing in both coming clean with his confession while showing that he believed that the experiment was for the betterment of mankind.
Additionally, while he paints blood appears out of nowhere, and does at other times too and isn't just a hallucination it seems.
In the nightmares, he visits people and brutally kills them with some sort of telepathic abilities while his eyes glow.
The members of 1 Giant Leap, while pushing the cutting-edge technology of the 21st century to its limit and utilizing their own fierce intelligence and consummate musicality plus a list of collaborators ranging from Michael Stipe to Kurt Vonnegut, Asha Bhosle to Dennis Hopper, have done just that.
I like surreal humour as much as the next person, but I swear I could feel my brain cells dying off while viewing this waste of time.
", after a while, you'll love it.
Most documentaries that I see look like a 60 Minutes news special or A&E Biography: you see lots of shots of people walking up and away from things while a voice over tells you "the facts."
This film showed how some can be so compassionate, while others respond in a different way, by being so heartless and thinking that by shooting these innocent animals, the problem will go away.
Mundin's acting never seems to flow, while O'Connor is embarrassingly overripe.
From Africa we go to rural China where Jin Ping (Lucy Liu, speaking Mandarin only) is the very pregnant force who runs an underground blood bank which while serving the donors with some cash also contaminates the population with HIV virus (we discover that Jin Ling is HIV positive, carrying a baby at risk, and supporting her HIV husband).
The writer-director Thom Fitzgerald, at the NY screening, said that the reality he encountered while researching it was probably even worse than he could bear to show.
Surprisingly the movie manages to sustain the intensity, asking questions while shining a light on different corners of the world.
One evening, while on his way home, he finds his house surrounded by a chemical defense agency that claims his house is now in the hands of terrorists that plan to make the whole city ground zero.
There was a fifteen minute scene where Gary Daniels and another actor chatted while sitting on bench.
This movie had some "style" in the direction I thought, but all the slo-mo just got boring after a while, and the action sequences were the flattest in the movie.
When almost everything they made turned to solid gold and that's what you get while watching the highly enjoyable The Adventures of Robin Hood.
The plot of a woman wanting to search for the daughter she gave away while the daughter is searching for her could have been very interesting.
Aging college dropout drifts between relationships while having kids she doesn't provide for.
The images are as stunning as any by Vittorio Storraro and the story is ultimately uplifting and hopeful as it details the lives of Argentine exiles trying to survive and move on with their lives while in exile in Paris.
It does have an interesting bit on Lenny Bruce while Carlin is there only in stock footage from one of his shows.
A mess of quick edits for a while.
Some are strongly affected, while others take them in stride.
What we do know is that now the word is held as vile filth by some, while others use it daily.
A brief and sexually explicit scene from a European rock concert shows how open other nations are to sexuality and the F-word's express meaning, while American's can't seem to get over it.
Nixon probably had one of the foulest mouths ever to enter the Whitehouse, while George Bush enjoys sticking his middle finger up at cameras.
It shows how positive energy is released while using the word f*ck.
As for the story itself- it's a fun little jaunt through deep space- in the vein of "Alien" as we watch the crew of the Saldes try and figure out just what happened while they were in cryogenic suspension.
i found this look inside the life of one woman in the adult film business interesting.for whatever reason,she allowed a camera crew to to follow her around,not just while working but also during her personal life.she seemed very candid and opened her self up.and allowed herself to be very vulnerable.or at least it appears that way.but it's clear she's also a tragic figure.regardless,the film is an entertaining piece and somewhat revealing.you see someone as a human being,and not just as a sex object.as interesting as the film is,there are no real revelations.and,when you get right down to it,it's still a sad subject.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 7/10
The concept behind this documentary, while presumably having been extremely difficult to implement, is simple as pie: it follows porn actress Stacy Valentine over a course of roughly two years (a hell of a long period for a documentary, and about several eons by porn standards) through her ups and downs, as she rises from mere talent to a "signed", award-winning star.
My husband said that when it started out, SV "seemed happy and pretty much OK for a while", but from almost the first shot of SV talking about how this is a great job for her because she loves sex and how the porn industry "is the only job where she would get people telling her she's sexy and beautiful", it was obvious that though she is smiling and sounding positive, but really just trying deep down to convince herself that she's happy.
Posted this one about a week ago, but it still has not appeared, so I will try once again...  Pornography is big business: while Amazon.com continues to hemorrhage red ink after four years, the average internet porn site is profitable within six months, and the industry as a whole raked in over a billion dollars last year alone.
A fantasy dream that was great while it lasted.
Warren William used to play ruthless bosses and all out cads, and while his role here is good and he gets to do some sleazy arguing and engineer some tricks on Mae West, GWYM was indeed a big step down for him.
The story may sound simple, and so it is, but no less does Fields manage to perform quite a few of his funniest routines ever, while always remaining conscious of the old-fashioned setting which is essential to the mood of the film.
This may diminish the big laugh somewhat, but it also demonstrates how Fields's frank humor was ahead of its time, forcing him to truly fight for his best ideas to be permitted once in a while, unlike today when comics can pretty much get away with anything.
As a boy, Fields reportedly wanted to become the world's greatest juggler, and while I possess absolutely no talent whatsoever whereas juggling is concerned, this performance should make him at least a worthy candidate in my book.
In desperate need of cash, McGonigle is compelled to woo a local wealthy widow who aspires to the stage, the magnificently named Cleopatra Pepperday (played with appropriate magnificence by Jan Duggan), while in the meantime his daughter is wooed by a college boy who also dreams of performing.
As another reviewer has pointed out, the main comic relief is provided by Billy Gilbert as the repo man and Ned Sparks as Michael's colleague Paul, but as Gilbert's party piece seems to be pretending to sneeze (in which he is joined in a duet by Barbara Stanwyck) and Sparks's speciality is talking out of the side of his mouth while holding a cigar firmly clamped between his jaws, I can only think that audiences of the thirties were more easily pleased than those of today would be.
We lived in India for a while, doing research on IT outsourcing.
He meets Marian, a proud Norman maiden, and, while showing her how the people suffer under the yoke of her fellows, they fall in love.
Excellent pacing, inspiring storyline and a catchy soundtrack mold this film into one of those you'll be sharing with your friends while having a good laugh here and there.
It's funny, smart, romantic and manages to do all of this while teaching Americans valuable lessons about life in a globalized world.
It would have been very easy for the filmmakers to fall back into stereotypes while writing and shooting this movie, but they skillfully steered clear of any pitfalls that plague so many other movies out there, especially in this genre.
He's even more perturbed when his boss makes it clear that Todd will be in charge of training the Indian workers to efficiently handle orders while sounding as American as possible; that's important since the firm markets all-American knickknacks, such as miniature flags, hot dog toasters and Wisconsin cheese hats.
I never realized while this show was running what a homage it was to the original TV series with George Reeves, but it truly is in so many ways.
The show every once in a while tries to relate to the comics what with the occasional characters like Toyman and Prankster and whatnot, but fortunately it tries to stay fresh and original and give us stories to which we don't know what will happen rather than redo some comic stories.
It took a while to adjust to Dean Cain, but the cast was good.
This TV show is amazing - still popular while it's been of the network for quite a long time already!
His mother Martha is the one who sews his uniform for him while she and husband Jonathan are always on hand to give their adoptive son advice on his love life.
In the buildup to this year's Rumble, new WWE World Champion, Kurt Angle, had been feuding with "World's Strongest Man" Mark Henry (a huge bloke who cannot wrestle), Rey Mysterio had been promising to Honor the memory of the late Eddie Guerrero, while John Xena was on the heels of Edge who had cashed in his "money in the bank" at New Year's Revolution to snatch the Heavyweight title from a battered Cena.
Edge is main event caliber now and is great in his heel role, while Cena is not the best wrestler and has received increased animosity from the older male audience, tired of his hip hop white boy image.
Till Rodriguez and Tarantino's homage to the genre, I will await volume 3 while secretly shooting up on volume 1 in the Papaya Dog bathroom.
Duvall has shown he can run a one man show before, with The Apostle, and while this film is entirely different, it's every bit as good.
The female lead is played by newcomer Luciana Pedraza who, while certainly accomplished as a dancer (assuming she did her own dance numbers), is entirely lacking in screen charisma.
Unfortunately, the vehicle for this examination is a familiar "hitman goes native for a while, but gets to go home again" theme.
I love this film so much I bought it in DVD, and in the last three years have shown it to 1) my Argentine wife; 2) her adult children and their friends; 3)several of my Argentine friends, and 4) the cats (who have to watch it while I'm watching it).
The constant is Cartman keep saying that it was all just a nightmare while we all see the visitors abducting Kyle's brother Ike, mutilated cows (we also see cows wanting to ride a train!)
In some ways, he was the Mark Damon of the Eighties (though Mark got more notice for a little while during his heyday.)
It is not entirely surprising that her husband turns to another women after a while.
Not POW's, not foreigners, but Russians (both peasants and city dwellers) who happened to come to the attention of the KGB due to some comment made while talking to friends or, even better, due to some anonymous letter denouncing them as 'traitors to the communist state'.
There is a very good documentary on the subject which airs once in a while on the Canadian History channel.
Aleksei, while the honest bright physician, falls in the clutches of a believable Olga (as Tatiana Doguileva) without much ado.
Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately, she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom, while Alexei does as well, just not quite as quickly.
I had trouble following the timeline, while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events, the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son.
The film focuses on the characters, their silent suffering and yearning for freedom while living in a state of constant paranoia as it tears husband from wife, mother from son, and heroism emerges from the most unlikely places.
Although they are identical in appearance, they have completely opposite personalities: Jane is the conservative, overachieving twin, while Roxy is a messy, truant punk.
Jane is a studious over-achiever while Roxy is a wild trouble making rocker.
While in his first films he simply appeared as a magician doing his show, in this movie there is a set build for the scene (instead of a simple circus stage), and while simple, the movie is clearly set in the middle ages.
It's been a while since I saw this film, but the one thing I remember best is the fact I was so unimpressed by the acting.
One of the guys, Pieter (Pierre Bokma), has a problem, and to solve this problem he needs the help of his friends, in special the help of Tom (Peter Blok) while he is a lawyer.
"C***s-R-us"); the acting, while not brilliant, is funny at least.
It takes a side trip into ghost story that, while unexpected is right on in keeping it from being just a take on M.D.Game.
I won't bore you by trying to tell the plot, quite simply the tale centers on a woman with a mission, seeking revenge on a sordid villain, while meeting all kinds of creepy and/or angelic characters along the way.
And while it may seem to be yet another warning that war will destroy all that we love, its a warning we can not hear often enough.
The hostility between the groups is tangible for a while, and an incident with a hand grenade results in the total destruction of the villagers food store.
There is a phrase said Smith taking back the grandma while the village keeps up with the party that somehow sums up the movie: "Such a good time.
There was a possible reference to this fact when, in the opening scene, Big Shot tells Smallpox while sniveling, "There comes a time when even the best of friends must part."
As for the short itself, it was rather funny, especially the scenes where the other kids run from Buckwheat and Big Shot while a radio announcer's voice warns listeners of the "epidemic," and when the kids hog the phone booth in a drug store while other people wanting to use the phone line up behind them (they hang up a sign that says "Line is bizzy").
"Tale of a Dog," according to Maltin and Bann's revised 1992 "Little Rascals" book, came out on Saturday, April 15 (Tax Day), 1944, while "Dancing Romeo" was released exactly two weeks later, Saturday, April 29, 1944 (April 29, 1962 was my birthday!).
It defies plausibility that the experimentalist actors have operatic voices, but the audience has to simply accept that, while trying to care about any of the characters struggling to survive whimsical arts patronage.
Penn perfectly portrays a mother who is trying to keep her relationship stable, while dealing with a very troubled daughter.
While things could have been better, there are other issues that makes it a challenge to bring them back to pieces, just like how Liv trying to patch up a plate broken by Bea while having a quarrel with Will.
Jude Law delivers another commanding performance, showing himself once again a master of the screen, while Vera Farmiga as a Russian prostitute brings the only other touch of life to this dead production with her hysterically funny and inspired cameo performance.
And while Binoche does a minimally adequate job portraying a Bosnian Muslim woman, giving the role to a South Slavic actress would've improved things substantially, and not just from the external authenticity standpoint.
She has to look after her 10 year old daughter suffering from ADD while struggling to feel appreciated and loved by the vacuous Law.
I was able to relate to the over-the-topness here, as I once had to race half a mile across a shopping mega-mall to retrieve my own son's tattered binkie remnant from the the shadows below the back seat of a new black pick-up truck he'd crawled through while it was on display in the mall's horse-track-sized center aisle.
**  I had a very strange reaction while watching 'Hellbent' last night: I was kind of excited to see a horror movie that was made by an openly gay director, and had played to some fanfare on the festival circuit.
One of them, a would-be cop who lost an eye in an accident (how that tidbit plays in at the end is both perfunctory and a distraction), plays the "straight" role, while the others comprise the obligatory group of slaughter fodder: the stud, who needs to lay everything with two legs and a heartbeat; the shy kid who just wants to get the phone number from that one guy; and the model who's so tired of being judged by his looks that he decides to go out for the night in drag just to prove to everyone that he's not as shallow as he seems.
We follow them (while the killer follows them as well) as Joey searches for his jock crush, Tobey explains to everyone he doesn't usually dress in drag, Chaz parties very hard, and Eddie tries to connect with Jake, the bad boy he wants to get to know better.
while i applaud the effort to make a "mainstream" horror film with a gay "edge", i have to honestly warn others of the absolute horribleness of this movie.
On the flip side there's the scene where Eddie is handcuffed to the bed while the killer is lurking about, undetected, in his apartment.
And while the technical aspects are fine, the editing could have been tighter and the special effects a bit more special.
Don't you guys ever remember..."Lady, my sweet lady.." I saw this movie in mid 70' while living overseas.
The characters, while an eclectic bunch, are all believable and keep the story moving along.
Yeah, forget about the fact we just witnessed what should have been the most horrifying 24 hours a human would have to go through in real life, you better not talk about your ex while I'm eating dinner.
I was at my girl's house and popped this in at 10 p.m., knowing that I had work the next day, I waited for the movie to pick up, while trying to hold myself from busting up from the ridiculous acting, poor script, and CGI that was probably generated by the Director's 6th grader son, hoping that in the next few minutes the movie would offer something interesting.
I fully expected to see the egg hatch while they were lunching on 'gator burgers' in Bangor and escape to bring on a sequel to this thing they called a movie.
There's one idiotic scene, apparently ripped off from the 3 Stooges, where a croc victim is talking while the creature behind him waits patiently for him to shut up, before devouring him.
Vlad possessed over some 22,000 men, while 7,000 were sent to defend Chilia against his cousin, Stephen, who ruled Moldavia.
Radu, it is implied, becomes the Sultan's personal plaything, while Vlad is subjected to torture for refusing to comply with his (the Sultan's) desires.
The girls all each savor a little growing up, unique and personal to themselves while the parents become lost in failed expectation and guilt about the loss of a child years earlier.
And, while all this doesn't seem very original, remember that KING KONG was second--this was the first film of its type and so it deserves a lot of kudos and recognition for its place in film history.
Willis O. Brien's special effects are still surprisingly good and way ahead of the 1960 version even if he was to perfect them further in King Kong (for which this film feels almost like a dress rehearsal at times), giving the film an epic scale in the volcanic eruption and stampede sequences, while Wallace Beery is a perfect choice for Professor Challenger, embodying the gruff, belligerent nature of the character to a tee.
Also features Lewis Stone, perhaps the only old man to actually die of a heart attack while yelling at kids to get off his lawn.
He goes completely berserk while making a presentation at the university when Edward Malone (Lloyd Hughes) reveals his identity as a newspaper reporter.
Nowadays there is not a complete version of the movie, most home video versions are of the 64 minutes version, while one (Image) is of a 93 minutes reconstruction.
And while probably that version is the closest we can be to the original runtime of the film, it sadly has modernized the dialogs, to the point that some lines are rewritten to fit our modern standards.
This version of the Lost World, while perhaps not a true classic like King Kong, nonetheless has its moments.
In this great mafia movie, i was really impressed with the realism of the scenes, is well shown in the movie all the previous research about the lives, behaviors and methods of some gangs in the U.S.; while i was watching the film i felt like watching real crime scenes in New York!
Ennio Morricone is at hand, and while his score here is not his best (certainly not a bad thing), it really adds to the feel of the movie; first played over the opening credits over a St. Patrick's Day parade in slow motion, and reoccurring throughout the film, it is a nostalgic, haunting theme that takes us to times past and reminds us of the contexts of the scenario.
Once in a while a movie comes along that is a gift for an actor.
Frank is one of the only people who seems to understand how important this deal is, while the rest of the gang bristles against the direction of the much more powerful and organized Mafia.
I'll admit it took me a while to realize it, but when I found myself laughing at, especially, Barrymore's "shoot him" and other extreme comments, I finally caught on.
I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!
And while I'll be the first to admit that this fourth installment has it's fair share of problems, I commend the production team for a job well done.
I loved the scene where Carla steals the guys' clothes while they are skinny dipping in a pool.
There are also a few twists and turns that, while well signposted, impress once again by showing how fearless Coscarelli really is when he has such faith in his own material.
A short while later Nanon is treated and cured of her phobia.
And while I like that movie better, this one is definitely worth watching.
As usual, Lon appeals to our best sadistic instincts while also eliciting genuine sympathy for his impossible love.
He's a career criminal on the run who with his cohort Cojo (John George), and continues to commit robberies while touring with the circus.
A very weird film much in the style of Tod Browning, THE UNKNOWN, while not being a horror film, has nevertheless been considered one of Lon Chaney's more distinctive work.
This film was a bit more sophisticated than the previous sequels while not compromising any of the traditional fun, scares, gore or witty one-liners we come to expect from Phantasm.
To me in their own way the siblings are both seeking comfort, Grace surrendering herself to her schizophrenic psychosis, slipping further into her unhinged religious ravings, while Dom does the complete opposite, closing out the disturbing confusion of his thoughts for the comfort of another's touch and the oblivion of sex.
Given the apparent aspirations of the film makers (please festival audiences enough to support eventual DVD sales), it would have been a real surprise if there *hadn't* been a happy ending (or at least a hopeful one), but while writer/director Michael Gallant crafts a nice one, he proves incapable of crafting a believable one.
Both sides feel fully justified in their stand on the issue, and for a long while, the viewer is left to choose the side he/she prefers.
It shows how two friends drift apart as one spirals towards madness brought on by shear hatred while the other finds redemption through forgiveness and tolerance.
"Dev" starts & ends with two close friends who are cops, while having their drinks, shares each others ideologies on backdrop of Hindu-Muslim Rifts.
Here Tej & the Chief Minister works hand in hand, while they remain dormant during Hindu attacks on Muslim.
Cushing is very little in the movie, crashing his car while in his way to defeat the aliens, and dying.
In the depths of winter, while the mainland is freezing in sub zero temperatures, the island of Fara is experiencing a highly localised and inexplicable heat wave.
The Northern island of Fara is experiencing very warm temperatures even though it is the middle of Winter while the rest of the UK is seeing the usual Winter weather.
Locals on the Island of Fera find themselves in the midst of a searing heat wave while the rest of the mainland of the UK is in the middle of a normal cold snap in November.
But I'm not saying this in a negative way ... the movie tries to do its best to tell the story in 90 minutes, and there will be few who don't feel coming up a tear or two while watching.
Young Joshua Harris must have been a talented child actor in his time given his affecting performance as Ben while Linda Hamilton and Richard Thomas were perfect as the parents, depicting their grief, strength and love for their son and his plight.
What I wound up doing, was conducting my own experiment-- by peeing on a bush, while making abusive comments.
Of course the sisters never appear on the film, their names are only referred by their husbands, while they try to make their way to Thasos (a magnificent island at the north of Aegean Sea) to find their wives and children for their summer vacation.
Everyone of the 3 protagonists is unique and different from the others, while the same time they are identical.
Panos (Yannis Zouganelis) plays great the love-in-first-sight victim, while he cannot betray, not his wife nor his family, but PAOK, his really beloved football club, the greatest one in North Greece.
Red's and blue's are emphasized while most of the images remain slightly desaturated.
And while he's dealing with emotions about the death, he founds out that Maja has a lover outside the marriage.
Speaking of which large chunks are made up of deleted scenes from "Phantasm", which, while suggesting money problems during development, actually works very well in bookending the events so far.
It also goes some way to filling in the gaps, giving the Tall Man a proper origin story and answering a few questions while still leaving enough up in the air to justify the 5th film which is apparently in production currently.
7/10  The combat system it fairly good, but it does get a bit repetitive after a while.
This does take a while though, with many weapons and spells at hand.
10/10  Single Player-The game is pretty fun alone, but the bad AI path-finding might get fairly annoying after a while.
Bong Connection failed to connect with me but maybe in some weird ways, there are taxi drivers who happen to have two girlfriends and a relaxed life while driving cabs to make money and maybe there are white American wives whose only job is to deliver drinks to her husband and their guests from morning.
None of the men suffer worse than the women, yet only the men come off as tough, while the women are basically weak and feeble.
Honestly, this is one of the worst horror movies I've seen in quite a while.
Oh, and driving while smoking and listening to your iPod is a winning combination.
It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene.
I don't need to see two fools flirt, while ones girlfriend is havin' a snooze to understand what goes on when they "get wood."
I think this movie is getting unfair treatment.It's not one of the best Afterdark Horrorfest films, but it definitely isn't one of the worst.The acting was actually good and not just horrible like it is in most B-Movies.The script is actually quite new and fresh, for a movie of this standard.It was also very entertaining to watch, and while I did find the ending EXTREMELY stupid, most of the material in this film didn't bother me.It was good, and I enjoyed watching it.The characters don't stick to you like they should, and there were a few flaws with this movie, but no movie's 100% perfect, and you definitely shouldn't sit down to watch this movie expecting to be.I liked it, and it's rating is too low if you ask me.I recommend it if you've liked all the others, because it is a fine edition to the series.
A friend of mine said while the book may have been a parody of Dickens, this film can be seen as a parody of Merchant/Ivory, and I think he's right.
Kate Beckinsale plays a young lady among a decidedly strange group of relatives on an obscure English country farm and, while ostensibly there to write her first novel, brings change to the lives of everyone involved.
As mentioned in the comments of others, Ms. Beckinsale, clad in her natty period togs and radiating a winsome, unflappable aura (while also projecting a strangely prepubescent vibe), hasn't had as good a role since Flora.
Rufus Sewell's Seth smolders hilariously while Stephen Fry's Mybug, "soaked in nature's fecund blessing", blusters uproariously.
It is in the latter that we definitely feel the struggle, violence, growth and pride of Joao Francisco dos Santos as a strongly driven heterosexual man that ultimately yields to his comfort in cross-dressing while maintaining a jagged, devoted relationship with Laurita and her/his child.
For a while the only way you could tell it was a potential thriller was the very moody, rather chilling score.
There's imagination and striking imagery when required Â the film's most tense moment takes place during a fade to black, while a night time drive takes on a disembodied quality Â but he's not out to batter his audience with technique.
The Butcher, however, is not a masterpiece because of its cynicism; it's a masterpiece because it manages to be cynical while having utmost respect for its characters.
Both of them prove that women can fight and that they can look very sexy while doing so.
He goes back to mom, after a while the gangsters shoot into the house and the boy tells his mom everything and says that he is sorry.
Second, while there isn't the incidental music, this is true of just about every film in 1929.
Also, while a few of the actors were dreadful (particularly "the champ"), the film was far less static than most of the early sound era.
while on his boat.
"); Neil Connery imitating one of the aforementioned blind Arabs while Adolfo Celi fights a losing battle to keep a straight face; Dr Connery, on seeing a man with a bloody great dagger sticking out of his heart noting "This man is dead.
The ending is nicely grim and while there might be enough of a "crime doesn't pay" moral to keep the censors happy it doesn't rub it in your face.
While he tries to purify the convent, nuns are masturbating in their cells, one nun using a dildo on another, some are licking and kissing in a state of frenzy, while the Mother Superior is wildly throwing herself around the bed pressing her legs together, nearly out of her mind.
The story is occasionally a bit disjointed, and while some critics harped on that, I found that it more fit the way nostalgia feel like... bits and pieces of memories held together by common threads.
And the U.S. considers gas to be a bug to be a nuke - so while we don't have massive stocks of nerve gas or bio-weapons, we do have plenty of nukes available.
On a side note, it's interesting that with the exception of a short fellatio bit the hetero scenes are strictly soft-core while the lesbian scenes are fully explicit.
And to all those who heard this movie was a throwback to traditional Kung Fu in movies- you will be sorely disappointed; while they do fight in a traditional style they use wires so much, it seemed like it was caught in limbo between a Shaw Bros movie and a Tsui Hark movie.
Mark Dacascos stars as Toby Wong, a genetically altered soldier who escapes from the Chinese corporation that built him and is on the run from thugs looking to return him back, also on board is Kadeem Hardison who becomes Dacascos' hostage and partner while top notch martial arts action ensues.
Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious that you could see it coming 10 minutes in front, so after a while everything that happened started to annoy me.
"Irritating", "annoying", and "aggravating" are the adjectives most often used to describe Mos Def's performance as Eddie in Richard Donner's latest film: a well-paced urban cop thriller which takes ordinary action-film clichÃ©s and raises them to about the pinnacle of their potential (while still remaining clichÃ©s).
Suffice it to say that "Vet Hard" succeeds marvelously at what it attempts to do, and while it lasts its damned fine entertainment.
Director Richard Donner directs the film with strong characterization while keeping the action exciting, but critically incidental to what the characters go through.
The Kerry people let Bush off the hook in defending their candidate's brilliant war record while Bush who did everything to avoid serving in the war ended up getting a free ride.
Instead, it's slow and pretentious, while at the same time directed as if it were Charlies Angels or The Matrix, with clip-and-snip editing and messy camera work.
Director Stephen Kay seems to have been influenced by MTV and this shows up in his directing , a funeral scenes is accompanied by a Moby song , a punch up is accompanied by Rush Holme With Love by Mint Royale ( A track that seems to be to film soundtracks this decade what Voodoo Chile was to film soundtracks the last decade ) while the final sequence closes with a track from Grove Armada .
It goes without saying Sly fails as a violent anti hero while Alan Cumming is very annoying and camp .
Mickey Rourke spends the entire movie posing , John McGinley seems to be on speed while Michael Caine makes little impression .
If you have a choice between shaving every hair on your body with a rusty razor while standing on a beach ball or watching this movie, I would go with the rusty razor.
This film is entertaining while not standing up to the 1971 classic, it does stand up as a good Stallone film and a worthy edition to an action fans DVD collection.
And a person two rows behind me was chunking loudly on their popcorn while talking.
Something that was admirable as well was that the director kept the language to a minimum when he could've gone all out, and, while gritty, the violence is most of the time bloodless.
My own theme music plays in the background while I make that request.
The story centers on the Buntings, a middle class London family who have a room for rent while the city is being terrorized every Tuesday by a mysterious Jack-the-Ripper-like serial killer who calls himself "The Avenger".
It was Hitchcock first major Success and one of two films in the 20's (the other was "Blackmail") that gave him an enormous reputation , It offers a possible explanation for"Jack the Ripper" and shows the beginning of many Hitchcock trademarks such as the Wrong Man on the run, fetishistic sexuality and murder, Death and Pleasure, In the Dark Thick Fog, London is awash with fear and loathing over a serial sex murder known as "The Avenger" who targets Blond Woman in particular and leaves their warm corpse lying in the street ,He always strikes on a Tuesday, his Face is covered, and Leaves his calling card always tucked away in the victims pocket, On a Tuesday night Daisy Bunting(June Tipp) a Model comes home to her little flat she shares with her family, her boyfriend(Malcolm Keen) the local chief of police is there boasting how he's going to catch the"avenger killer while flipping a coin in the air, Suddenly the Gas meter switches off and while Daisys Father (Arthur Chesney) goes to insert another coin in , The house goes dark All of A sudden their is a knock on the Door and Mrs Bunting (Played beautifully by Marie Ault) Opens the Door to a pall faced Tall man with his face Covered (Ivor Novello) inquiring about the room for let upstairs,The Pale Antisocial Asexual Unnamed man begins his association with the family and starts More trouble than they can possibility imagine, especially when we seems to take Interest in Daisy who Just Happens to be Fair Haired.Suspicion Falls upon the odd Introvert and coincidence seems to follow fact as Tuesday Night Comes Around Again and another scream is heard in the Depths of the London Fog.
There's also a scene in which a sexy young girl is happily taking a bath while the lodger tries to sneak into the bathroom.
A lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life; in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films, and while Singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments (which are highly enjoyable), I found it to resemble life more than most genre films.
And while I never believe that he IS Dean Martin, Northam does create a character that is interesting to watch for about 45 minutes.
Hayes, unfortunately, shows that, while a gifted physical comedian, does not have the chops to create a complex dramatic characterization.
He must have had a mental lapse of the skills he had acquired while filming this or he just sold the filmmakers his name to put on the credits but one of the two must have happened.
If you saw this film while you were high it still wouldn't be funny and would probably scare you instead.
It allows these actors to revel in the absurd while pocking fun at a bunch of taboo topics.
The acting is interesting, the direction is adequate, and while Buck Henry's screenplay deviates (?)
Especially while lounging in a bean bag chair on the purple shag carpet.
And in the same scene Dr. Wu is first threatened with a gun, kicks the gun out of the mobster's hands and then starts to fight with the other mobsters, while no one thinks of pulling a gun and simply shoot the good ol' Dr.  Painstaking efforts at acting, especially in the scenes that are meant to be sentimental and/or romantic.
We can't journey back in time to those days of innocence, but we sure can recapture the feeling of them, if even for just a little while, with a vessel like The Water Horse leading the way.
Which makes me appreaciate movies like this one, that for a little while, I can forget the fact that my body is alive, soul wounded, and brain damaged.
The boy leaves it for a while and when he comes back to it, the "stone" is broken and a strange creature has hatched out...
Water Horse holds a 6.8 rating on IMDb, while Beyond Lock Ness has only a 4.0 rating.
It embodies the otherworldly interests that so many youngsters have while providing a realistic backdrop for parents.
Furthermore, while the "drama" at the beginning lagged, I actually find myself kind of into the anti-war drama towards the end.
It's definitely a tear jerker, but one of the better films I've seen in a little while in the theater.
But he takes care of the baby who is water bound, while protecting him from his mom and the soldiers.
I would highly recommend The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep, it's one of the best family films I have seen in a while.
Of course, there is scheming behind his back to seize his throne while he is gone.
And while DeMille clearly loves the massive crowd shot, he has enough sense to shrink the space and simplify the setting when it comes to key dialogue scenes.
Another woman falls for a corpse who whisks her away to hell while on Japanese holiday.
In spite of the subject matter, action takes a back seat to art as the film languishes in the beauty of each scene while telling a thin and only mildly interesting story.
She treats him and everybody else like dirt while she plays the Boss for a fool.
But Zhang Yimou can be forgiven for playing to the powers that be because he does it with subtle irony and for a purpose, the purpose being to give himself the celebrity and an international reputation so that he is able to make films that might in some way criticize the communist state while he maintains a position of loyalty to that state.
Harold loses the love of his life and wants to end it all.His all suicide attempts are failures.But he ends up marrying a pretty girl and ends up with her in a mansion that is spooked by a wicked uncle who wants to scare the young people away so he can have the place for himself.Alfred J. Goulding and Hal Roach are the directors of Haunted Spooks (1920).It's great to watch Harold Lloyd do his comedy.Mildred Davis is beautiful and brilliant as the girl.She would become Harold's real-life wife three years later.The film has lots of fun during its 25 minutes.It's awfully funny to watch Harold and Mildred in a car while those chicken and ducks peck him in the head.And comedy meets tragedy in all those suicide attempts.Lloyd sacrificed two of his fingers when a prop bomb exploded in his hand.What wouldn't Harold have done for comedy?
Another involving the typical self-absorbed nature of people as a man pauses him in another attempt to ask for a light and then the time while failing to notice the circumstances is equally riotous.
Hands down the best dirty cop film I've seen in a while.
With the exception of, for instance, Â´There is something about MaryÂ´ I have yet to laugh once while watching these exercises in psychological torture.
This film is so good that while I'm watching it, I forget that Cloris Leachman was ever Frau Blucher!
However, it's great fun while it lasts and you'll always have a fond, if somewhat faded, memory of the movie.
Robbie Hart is a genuinely likable character; he's a person I would like to have as a friend, and he's a performer I would gladly hire to sing at my OWN wedding (Sandler also seems completely comfortable with his character, while even Drew Barrymore sometimes sounds like she's merely reciting written dialogue).
The show has maintained itself in the 3 seasons it has gone for and while not going for long has shown great potential.
This should go down in the same line as Family Guy and American Dad and while it will not win any Oscars (It has won awards though) it is a worth while show.
The person just keeps on talking, snickering at himself from time to time, and after a while, you just start to think, "it's funny, but who really cares?"
You really never know hat to expect while watching this show.
The show's humour while not topical does not try to be, sure there are a few bush are idiot jokes but it's not preachy nor does it expect you to laugh at its hidden meaning.
Piped into our homes, our creativity sits on the shelf while we down popcorn in front of the bluish glare of the glass boob-tube.
Some of them are only a few seconds while others can be five minutes.
What irks me above all is the show's immense popularity and the fact that it is constantly on adult swim's weekday lineup while worthy, innovative, dynamic and unique shows are forced aside.
They decide to go and while they are in India they come across a strange lady that claims to be a reincarnation of a servant girl that once lived in a paradise garden with royal subjects.
Mason is poorly miscast as a Austrian medical student accused of espionage while on vacation at a resort hotel in the south of France.
But after a while, you kind of start liking it!
Harvey Keitel, as the lead investigator into the case, gives an amazing performance, supplying the audience with the right level of doubt about Cynthia's story to keep the suspense flying until the end - and all while sitting in the same chair for most of the film!
The ending manages to tie all the ends of the mystery up while grabbing at your emotions.
Glenne Headly (Joyce) is also outstanding while Bruce Willis is excellent as Joyce's drug-addled, boozing, wife-beating loser of a husband.
The dialogue is right on, realistically depicting the lives of New Jersey beauty shop people while the plot told in ersatz flashbacks unfolds nicely with a fine tension.
In movies, since anything can be contrived, it is the usual rule to have the camera show the truth while letting the characters do the lying.
Woody Strode and Henry Silva go through the motions with such little effort, while the leading man Harrison Muller provides the personality, but his timing seems off.
Then, out of nowhere, Strode (playing a character named "Polo") sends Muller and Silva on their way, while he stays behind.
The most jawdropping aspect of the film has to be the extended climactic siege, where Muller and a prostitute take refuge in a brothel while Strode's army attacks.
Our girls can stick it to the enemy while still standing by their men!
Goddard flirts with several officers while Colbert carries on a romance with George Reeves (Superman!)
Paulette Goddard,(Lt. Joan O'Doul),"Reap the Wild Wind",'42 gave an outstanding supporting role while under constant bombing from the Japanese Zero planes.
How women can be strong in times of danger and be heroes in times of war, but all the while keep their femininity, compassion, and sensitivity.
Interesting for the fact that it was shot while the war was still raging ~ so there are a lot of decidedly non-PC references to "Japs" ~ but this is a real salute to the unsung women who served in "the big one."
The fact that this movie was released while the war was still going on, is further testament to it's courageous stance in not candy coating the horrors of war.
"Shadowzone" is a typical horror film from Full Moon Entertainment.In the underground laboratory a group of scientists are doing experiments with dreams.They accidentally kill one of the volunteers.David Beecroft is sent to investigate the death.When he arrives there,he finds out that the scientists have released a monster from a dream dimension.All of them are stuck under the ground while the monster kills them.
When Ben Gazzara's character asks her to move to Florida, while it's obvious she's interested, she tells him "I'll have to look up Jacksonville on the internet."
Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed was that, while there are humorous (and absurd) things that happen when we are single, this DOES show that, but not as so much ridiculous fluff.
She shyly volunteers that she gives good head, for instance, and her offer is accepted repeatedly, while between encounters she's got the stink of something best left outside -- and so she is.
However, my friend and I laughed our lungs out while watching.
Tragically flawed with low self-esteem, she covers it up with fantasies of happily ever after, even fooling herself, while the more level-headed, but also flawed Beth tries to do her best to stay happy with her absent-fathered daughter and inject a little reality into Deb's world.
You look at her and you feel love and compassion even admiration for that woman while if it had been badly acted and/or directed she could have looked stupid and slutty so again masterfully crafted.
Maybe I enjoyed it more because I was with my friends, but believe me, it's good to see such a non-stop laugh riot once in a while, however non-sensical!
I almost fell asleep while watching this poor excuse for a movie.
But while I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's "so bad, it's good", I will have to confess that there were times when I laughed because of the overwhelming stupidity.
Unlike Corman, who (at least for awhile) aspired to better work, Milligan was content to line his pockets while expressing contempt for mankind.
I think of this film every once in a while, and wonder why it's not on VHS or DVD.
The highlight of the pilot is Remo involved in a brawl with members of a motorcycle gang, while wearing a pair of woman's roller skates???
And while the show certainly has a contingent of fans who revere it for its space battles and transforming mecha, I have to say that I love it most for starting things off on a footing that allows the viewer to think they know exactly where the story's going to go and then consistently pulling the rug out from under them.
Maybe he just got caught up in a moment of goofy bliss while working with Cameron & Drew.
Some critics have compared the showdown between Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) with the rivalry between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X during the turbulent 1960s, while others have recognized mutants as symbols of any oppressed group forced to identify themselves, whether they be classified as homosexuals, communists, Jewish, or firearms owners.
He destroys the high, iron, barb-wired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him.
This grim scene in Auschwitz hearkens back to "Schindler's List (1193), while the show of paranormal power recalls Brian De Palma's "Carrie."
Concisely, in a model of economy, Singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation!
Based on the comics, the movie X-Men, while there are many important characters, follows Marie a.k.a.
Her husband, Mehdi, is a mass of contradictions as he tries to come to terms with his bisexuality, falling further in love with Manu, even while raiding dens of iniquity in his on-duty hours.
Take Manu's sister Julie, who even at the day of the funeral of her brother seemed to care more for her cherished role in an opera; or Adrien, who loses himself in his role of potential savior of the AIDS-epidemic; or Mehdi, who was more involved with fear for his own health, and who switches shamelessly between Manu, Sarah and in the end even Manu's sister, while in the meantime relentlessly executing a witch-hunt on brothels and prostitutes, even if this means hurting innocent people like Julie.
It was unusual to see folk come down with the disease while it was still classified as a 'mystery' and while docs were desperately searching for cures, reasons, symptoms etc.
They have an open marriage and have just given birth to a baby boy - a factor that disrupts their separate lives while conflicting their married life.
Sarah has a physician friend Adrien (Michel Blanc, so memorable in his role in 'Monsieur Hire') who is gay, and while he is older, he still longs for the company of young men.
Adrien and Manu strike up a friendship and are invited to join Sarah and Mehdi to Sarah's mother's cabin by the sea and while there a relationship between Manu and Mehdi begins, one that will become an affair in secret.
Though Adrien's ties with Manu have become platonic while Manu see Mehdi daily, Adrien is the first to notice lesions on Manu, lesions that are the hallmark of AIDS.
This is a good movie and while I'd more skeletons matching at the humans gunning each other down and then a bit more plot on Conner but what this movie does right is Marcus, not to say Bale did a bad job but Marcus is the show.
It was actually remade Â and considerably improved upon Â by THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO (1945), a Droopy 'vehicle'; while remarkably similar in many respects to the later classic, one of my favorite Averys, it is a minor (if still highly enjoyable) effort Â for one thing, because of an anonymous i.e.
Some of the women were forced to commit suicide to protect the family "honor" while others ended up marrying their abductors out of self protection, a theme dramatized in Silent Waters, a film by U.S.-educated Pakistani director Sabiha Sumar.
Ayesha never goes to the village well to draw water while Saleem gets seduced by Islamic fundamentalists and transforms from a love sick puppy to the man he thinks he wants to be.
Khamosh Pani has exposed me to some of this pain and while it may not be my own I can feel it.
The casting is genius as well, beginning with Clive Owen, who's dead-on here, with his ever-present carrot in hand, rescuing the (adorable) baby, getting the girl, killing the bad guys (who just keep coming like deranged vampire replicants), even solving The Mystery from the most obscure of clues, all while complaining about everything he hates, which ranges from "people who don't use their turn signals" to "a pussy with a gun in his hand."
There's a running bit in the film where his wife keeps calling him on his cell phone, usually while he's in the midst of gunning people down, and this has a really hilarious payoff toward the end - one of the funniest parts of the movie, in my estimation.
The film is shot in stark, sharp tones, making it look like a comic book come to life more than any film I've ever seen, while still using real actors.
In Shoot 'Em Up, they continue the act, which actually culminates while the bullets are flying.
See it on the big screen, while you can.
Not often do you see a guy deliver a baby while shooting people at the same time.
What do you get when the first 5 minutes of a film has a guy kill somebody with a carrot, and proceed to deliver a baby in the middle of a shoot out while constantly dishing out one liners that are nothing short of snappy-as-hell?
As I said, the plot doesn't make much sense, but it basically follows Clive Owen trying to save the baby he rescues after its mother dies giving birth in the middle of a shoot out, while protecting it from the evil Paul Giamatti and his henchmen.
Here, he pulls out his gun and kills all the bad guys, while still having sex with Belluci.
Other than that, one of the best action movies I've seen in a long while.
What follows is a blood-soaked, five minute action sequence that involves Smith delivering her baby while in the middle of a bloody shootout.
Clive Owen has always been one of my favourite actors and while Mr Smith doesn't match up to some of his best performances, Children of Men's Theo, Chancer's Stephen Crane, etc, he still launches into the role with his trademark professionalism.
And if you've ever wanted to see a gunfight while in midair, you can in Shoot em Up!
My advice would be to watch it with some friends, have a few beers and get really sloshed while you're at it.
Davis does an excellent job keeping the tension and suspense high, while keeping the action not too close to the viewer, but not too far away either.
See how Owen kills special ops assassins while having sex with "hooker with a heart of gold" Monica Belluci(..she even climaxes as he blows one of these heavily equipped villains through a window).
When a bullet through the forehead leaves this woman dead, Smith will have to find shelter for the infant while dodging constant gun-fire.
We have gunfight while eating carrot, death by carrot, firing a gun with a carrot, gunfight during sex, gunfight while birthing, gunfight while parachuting and gunfight with no workable fingers with which to fire (that's where the carrot comes in again).
firing two guns while jumping through the air, shooting guns out of speeding cars, etc.)
I'll be sure to see it at least a couple more times while it is still in theaters.
You will find yourself laughing from the moment the movie starts to the ending (which you won't be glancing at your watch while waiting for).
He shoots while having sex, he shoots while in the middle of free-fall, he shoots the umbilical cord off of a baby, he shoots with his fingers broken.
Parts of the show (movie) had me thinking "Oh my God" while other times, I got up to clean out the litter boxes.
Overall, while this film does have some flaws; it's still an excellent thriller and it's very unfair that this is so little known!
T3 had lots of plot holes, but while T3 was letdown from T2, at least T3 attempted to give more attention to the characters.
The basic story has some, but little, promise or value, while the plot development and screenplay are extremely forced, contrived, and, in a word, cretinous.
The film does manage a true seventies exploitation style and while the film obviously shot on a very low budget, it still manages to be fairly good in that respect.
The film also lacks a lot of humour, and while it's clear that the filmmakers were not making a serious horror film to the audience; apparently they themselves were oblivious that fact!
Watching Wonderland is like going to a bad party - the music is bad, the people are boring, pretentious and unattractive, and while it's only a couple of hours until it's over, it seems like much, much, longer.
The main difference between the characters of both movies, is that while Magnolia's characters were unconventional, those in Wonderland are the kind of people you cross on the streets everyday.
But while the story between both movies are in the same vein, the treatment in each movie is totally different.
This is no doubt a casualty of the scarlet letter that is the PG-13 rating, oft denied by the production while they dropped subtle hints along the way such as toy deals, Pizza Hut endorsements and McG noting how the PG-13 The Dark Knight was "made without compromise".
When I first began watching it I loved it and tried to watch every episode, but after a while my interest in Inuyasha began to fade and I found myself tuning out around the time the episode count rounded 80, the problem was that the show began to progress at a snail's pace and we were all left with these story plots repeated over and over again in a slightly altered fashion each turn: 1.
Mainly, Inuyasha is a very good series up until the midway point, don't get me wrong, there are still several episodes that are good after episode 100 but later on in the series most of the characters you have come to love begin to have nothing to do except for stand on the sidelines while Inuyasha fights and they occasionally interfere.
I agree with the people who say to only watch about half of them, they just get a bit annoying after a while.
Those are just what I've noticed in this while...
This series has to be the worst possible anime I've ever seen in a while.
The big bad of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while.
Although it's too long (the only major flaw, since the 160 episodes watered down the story) and has some weak episodes, "Inuyasha" is nothing short of brilliant, and it seems it's characters will never become boring: from Miroku, who is always touching woman's butts and asking them if they will have a baby with him up to Kagome who is trying to maintain her good grades in school while fighting in medieval Japan.
3) When Kagome finds out Inuyasha is alive she runs towards him, passing by Kouga, all the while her tears are falling on his sad face.
But all of the performances stood out, particularly Judd Nelson, who makes us completely forget about The Breakfast Club while reminding us that he can still act.
Where Carandiru, the film, succeeds while Sepultura's song failed, is that the film gives the prisoners a very rational, human face.
It has also been said that the film lacks focus, with many prisoners getting a little detail, while others get none at all.
But all that changes in the last half hour of the film after the riot has begun and we see the prisoners gunned down in cold blood, many of them while cowering in their cells.
This movie fails miserably in both aspects where the new Star Trek film shines: staying true to the original while making the new characterizations and situations compelling on their own merit.
And while this movie needed to have a big-name celebrity like Christian Bale to have a chance at success without Ah-nold in the main role, it couldn't have been any worse if Nick Stahl and Claire Danes had been brought back.
Prisoners like Highness, who is eternally juggling two women at the same time (even while in prison!).
we are all familiar, so let me say this simply with Pros and COns  Pros ----  -Solidly continues the legacy without repeating the same idea (send a terminator back in time to kill one of the Connors) - Characters are likable (although kinda wooden here and there) - Action is fantastic - Score is actually engaging (i love the old school synth soundtrack, but i prefer Danny Elfman's live strings more) - Visually fantastic (direction, cinematography)  Cons ----  - Stated above, while the characters are likable they are wooden-ish - Script is a little rushed (a few moments of cheese :P)  There you have it.
If you are looking for a good movie to have fun while watching, not truncated and complex in its storyline or editing, you will enjoy - as I did - Carandiru.
It is good to sleep while you're watching this movie, because you'll wake up and see that almost nothing has happened, so you can safely eat some popcorn and continue sleeping.
Samira Makhmalbaf comes again with an anguishing tale of a woman that wants to believe in the role of women in a modern society while her own family is disintegrating around her.
We catch a glimpse of her spirit while witnessing her hardships.
The story of Noqreh who dreams of becoming president while hiding her school attendance from her conservative father is very intense.
The 1942 film THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER was possibly the best comedy film that Bette Davis ever appeared in, but while she got starring position in the film's credits, the real star (who went to town as a result) was the great Monty Woolley, recreating his magnificent acid tongued curmudgeon Sheridan Whiteside.
J.R. is now the owner of Weststar Oil, the largest independent oil company in Texas, while Ewing Oil -- now owned by Bobby and Sue Ellen -- is right behind it.
But before you shout "rip off" and discredit Delpy's effort as another Linklater clone, I can safely say there are distinct differences between the movies, and that while Linklater's had a kind of dreamy romanticism to his, Delphy's 2 Days in Parissomehow had a more realistic, grittier, down to earth look and feel (no offense to Linklater, whose movies I mentioned I just adore too), tackling a key issue in relationship, and that's honesty.
Neil gets into sexual play with his baseball trainer and turns a gay hustler while Brian sees UFOs and tries to find out about the moments his mind blacked out.. of course thinking of an alien abduction.
The movie basically deals with Brian trying to unfold the mystery of his blanked out memory and meeting a strange UFO-Girl with similar experiences while Neil is growing up into more and more sexual obsessed gay life.
Neil becomes a prostitute, searching for unrequited love in quick sordid affairs in the back seat of cars and squalid apartments, while Brian believes he was abducted by aliens.
Of course, it is a bit graphic and over the edge, but at least it can do that while still holding the emotional appeal that makes it so great in the first place.
It's a very sobering experience that will leave you quietly while speaking profound words.
After a while I heard a whispering from deep within the speaker.
Ten years later, their lives could not be more different - Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has became a gay hustler, cynical, manipulative but charismatic, while Brian (Brady Corbet), nervous and shy believes that he was abducted by the aliens for some strange experiments.
I don't know how Araki managed to shoot these sequences while retaining the innocence of such young, innocent performers.
Words can only reveal so much, while Araki's images display an almost unbearable amount of visceral material, exploiting vibrant color, alluring texture, dark and light, the brooding and harrowing eyes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the handsome modesty of Brady Corbet.
We discover that Neil has grown up to be both gay and a hustler, while asexual Brian's free time is taken up seeking the source of and resolution to his insoluble physical ailments.
Neil eventually moves to New York, while his pining friend Eric (Jeff Licon) actually befriends Brian and an endearing friendship ensues.
Stander, too, is a lovely fairy while Sara is a hoot as the specs-wearing, didactic teacher.
Simply written and performed, Gentry's song had an aura of mysterious tragedy, for clearly there was some unknown relationship between the singer and Billy Joe--and while Gentry implied a great deal, she did not specify the details, leaving her listeners to wonder and make interpretations of their own.
But while Max Bear is no great shakes as a director, he actually did film the movie in Mississippi, and what's more he filmed it around the old Talliahatchie bridge, so for once they got at least that much right.
Hollywood often confuses the accent issue of films set in foreign lands by casting one or two people who have some type of accent while the rest do not.
The extended scene where he, while hidden, metes out sentences to his friends who were also caught stealing, is pure delight, and very worthy of Sturges.
But once in a while you are rewarded with a bit of an unexpected gem & Slaughter Studios was just such an occasion for me, definitely worth a watch.
Director Brian Katkin and writers Dan Acre & John Huckert crafted a very funny comedy that parodies the cheesy 80's B-slashers while paying homage to the cheesy 50's sci-fi horrors.
Strange things begin to happen and they wonder if the place was cursed after the event that led to it's closure 20 years before: the death of a young star while shooting a scene.
Although there were scenes that look as if they had been shot with a DV while in post-production, most of the film is very well done.
In no time at all, the sheriff finds Bentley locked up in the basement with Weatherby and Andy where Bardoni had put them while he searched for the $50-thousand.
Efficiently directed in a briskly straightforward and economical no-frills manner by Sam Newfield, with an endearingly hokey script by Fred Myton, plenty of sharply sardonic dialogue, stark, gritty black and white photography by Robert Cline, a booming, melodramatic score by Charles Dunworth, and game acting from a solid cast (Glenn Strange in particular contributes an amiable performance as Bradford's clumsy, cowardly, oafish assistant Andy while Charlie Middleton registers strongly as a jerky ramrod sheriff), this wittily enjoyable Grade B mystery thriller potboiler delivers a reasonable amount of cheap thrills.
Urich plays a single dad who while on vacation with his daughter starts to investigate a series of cattle mutilations.
When this show first came out it was considered the Sex and the City for the black folk, and while the premises of the show is smiler (withe the four female friends looking for love career and everything else in between) it's rather different as well.
it's incredibly witty in that Frasier type way and that probably has to do with Kelsy Grammar producing the show, and while they not afraid to talk about sex or in the case of Joan the lack there for every episode is not contaminated with naked torsos all over.
Technically this is a film that could have used some rewrites on the script because while you watch it some things just don't make sense.
The shots of Norway, while picturesque, are just crammed into scenes that are ridiculous.
I'll start with my obvious statement, that I'm not necessarily a big fan of musicals (quite the contrary) and while I will write that I also didn't enjoy "Sound of Music" as much, I am aware that some/many will dislike my comment here.
Like I said, they aren't bad, but it gets to be a bit much after a while.
The only reason I didn't rate this amazing film higher is that after a while it all becomes a tad tedious, as this is NOT a film with a lot of commercial appeal.
Sybylla is cast from all three levels of societal income; from living in middle class, to visiting her wealthy aunt (all the while pampered like a baby) and even forced to becoming a servant to a poor family.
Its genius, shooting from outside in, peering in through windows and doors while we see Â literally Â the story beginning to be written.
Another one of the funniest parts is when Tom is trying to locate the ball far off into the distance and Jerry whistles to him after a while only to reveal he had the ball the whole time.
I thought this a better than average legal drama, and while a previous review called this something like "clichÃ© city," I thought there were some fresh twists on familiar themes.
One of the best scenes is when Charlie (Meyers) is watching "A Current Affair" while using a theighmaster!
The movie also has a number of cameo's of gifted character actors who while only on the screen no more two minutes, deliver some classic comedic bits.
Granny (Stella Stevens) gets a visit from a strange man who gives her this potion that he claims will give her eternal life, while this is going on Granny's Granddaughter Kelly (Shannon Whirry) is preparing dinner for all Granny's nasty, greedy, money seeking relatives.
It takes a little while to grasp the point of why the the old man keeps insulting the boy for his over-sized head as well as to develop the mental image of Dad telling his wife to show Travis the family photo album..."show her the one where he **** his pants in Niagara Falls!"
But while they are dating he has suspicions about her.
Misunderstandings pile up on top of each like a 10-car highway accident and push the town closer and closer to a dreaded race riot while the actual victim's plight seems all but forgotten.
The uplifting rescue will be the talk of the town for three days, while the ugliness that flared up will linger on.
In Dolls he showed his indifference by underplaying the murders, while in Bay of Blood he took the opposite approach by amplifying the violent homicides almost to parody level, in the process relegating the story and characters to even less importance than was customary for the genre.
Some characters are prepared to fight violently for this bit of real estate, while others are opposed to the potential environmental nightmare that could ensue if either of the warring parties have their way.
A German girl is chased by the killer while her clothes are literally falling off and her subsequent death throws are presented with an undeniable erotic charge.
While this combination of eroticism and violence is common in gialli, the subsequent double-murder of the teenagers impaled by a spear while having sex is very much slasher territory.
The killer's hatchet plants itself in victim's heads and throats vulgarly while the camera seems to zoom in on the corpses endlessly.
The bay itself looks great and excellently lends itself as a location for savagery, while the decors of the character's homes are elaborately Gothic.
Each killing is seemingly detached from the story itself and the film takes an all new unique approach, as the deaths come to the fore while the rest fades in the background.
The flick follows in the path of Kevin Smith while at the same time blazing it's own unique path by putting a spin on the classic romantic comedy rules, i.e.
But beneath the shtick and slapstick, beneath the flashy pomp and circumstance, there's a really sweet story of longing, love, lust, friendship, hope, and learning to appreciate what you have while you have it.
You see, I was pointed in the direction of this movie a couple years ago, while the filming was still going on.
The flip side is that while it made me laugh, it was also exploring some real issues about relationships and commitment and man's difficulties doing either!
A hilarious cameo from Ginger Lynn Allen just tops this film off for me, and is one of the funniest films I've seen for it's while.
hilarity ensues as Zack handles all the activity at the billiards shop while trying to figure out what happened and what to do.
been watching the progress of this movie since i first found out about it on the view askew web board and knew i needed to see it.... after watching the trailer i knew it was going to be one of the greatest movies id be allowed to see by the evil gnomes who choose my movies very carefully.. the type of movie this is really isn't done enough and the quality of the writing will amaze you... its tough writing a review for something while not saying too much about it but i really hate to spoil movies for other people, as i hate having them spoiled for me... let me just say to you.... awesome frickin' awesome   check out Kisses and Caroms, you surely will not be disappointed...
Kisses And Caroms is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.
Cheryl talks about how she lost her virginity while babysitting with Bill (Greg Rome).
In one shot Sanders reads a Popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie).
There are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene).
I thought the director did a superb job giving enough location shots to make you swoon while allowing the actors do what they do so well.
The story of a lost tribe of native Americans that are discovered by a "cowboy" and a professor while looking for clues to missing persons.
Last of the Dogmen takes you into the past while remaining in the present.
It is a story about an itinerate cowboy and a secret that he stumbles across while tracking some runaway convicts.
I also had a reminiscent thoughts of "Last of the Mohican's (Daniel Day Lewis) while watching this film, up until the point when I realize that this lost Indian tribe was more civilized than the law enforcement agency of the local town.
That's when I get the itch to feel my horse moving under me while riding through the thick forest.
My theory is that Thadd Turner woke up from a drunken stupor and simply wrote down what he'd dreamed while under the influence of alcohol poisoning.
Tom Berringer discovers them with the help of Barbera Hershey while the sheriff played by Kurtwood Smith is looking for him.
From his mumbling complaints at the front desk, just trying to be heard, to his desperate search for his pocketbook, while the thief wrestles with his conscience, to his confrontation with Beery, he was note-perfect.
The Baron concocts a plan to rob the Great Grusinskaya of her pearl necklace while she's at the Berlin Theater doing her thing: Dancing her heart out for the audience there.
Baron Felix who's only friend on earth up to that time is his cute and faithful Dachshund Adolphus, or Adolph for short, will later "make it" with that cold fish of a woman Grusinskaya while in the process of burglarizing her hotel suite!
While Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone are quite good, and while Lionel Barrymore is unexpectedly effective (and much less mannered than his brother John), it is really Joan Crawford that points the way toward the new acting style.
Indeed, the stars in Grand Hotel are true stars, the foremost being Garbo: while often cited as one of the great actresses, few seem to recall how mesmerizing Garbo truly was.
One can also add Senf (Jean Hersholt) who has to stay at his hotel job, while his wife is facing a dangerous childbirth which is worrying him to death.
John charms both the men and women on screen with natural ease, while Lionel whimpers and whines like no other ever could.
Joan Crawford's Flammchen doesn't actively use her charms as sort of glide by while positively glowing and stealing all of the light from Garbo, and one can sense that were she of a much different nature, all of the men in GRAND HOTEL would have a dangerous young woman to deal with, and Barrymore's end would be similar to J. Howard Marshall's demise in the hands of (a much smarter, less coked-up) Anna Nicole Smith.
Its values were the thing back in the Depression era, showing glossy characters who were all looking for some form of security while surrounded by the exuberance of the hotel and who were not given much depth in their characterizations.
From the beginning scene where we see the Smokey of the title drinking from a baby bottle with booze in it while waiting for speeders in Backwater, USA, I knew I was in for a slow downhill ride to nowhere.
However, the hero of the film manages to do well for a while thanks to the help of another participant--a very pretty and sweet young lady.
They decide to take a detour to get this gold while Trejo laughs... for minutes on end.
This flick while never something even approaching what someone might deem good, was enjoyable enough...up to a point.
Unless you have a penchant for murders and brutality then this movie isn't just worth your while.
And so Jason is in his same body again and while fighting Steve Jessica impales the dagger into Jason sending him into hell.
then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing.
Director Adam Marcus, working from a clever script by Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely, relates the compelling story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a mean, brutal tone throughout, delivers plenty of nasty gore (a young lady getting impaled on a tent spike while doing just what you think with her boyfriend rates as the definite splatter highlight), further tarts things up with a welcome sense of self-mocking black humor, offers a generous sprinkling of tasty female nudity, stages the murder set pieces with rip-roaring brio (the delightfully outrageous diner massacre sequence in particular seriously smokes), and really goes for broke with a gloriously wild ending which comes complete with one doozy of a sequel set-up punchline.
Maybe if I had then I'd be privy to lots of nuances and depth lost on me while watching Goes To Hell.
The Doc does so in a full-gore depiction, while energy lights from Jason's remains fly out and possess him.
This one is the brightly-light product of a studio, while a series of gore-riddled set pieces vie for attention.
In fact that's pretty typical for Lo Wei - probably half the films he made were directed by the actors while he was off gambling, drinking, or sleeping it off.
Once after that, I asked my father if that was the, 'pirate from the silent movie', while we were watching something with Gilbert Roland.
It's sad that while Calhern was given an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Ann Harding was not similarly honored.
The dialog is blessed with more expletives than Eddy Murphy Raw, while maintaining a fresh 'I've never heard actual conversations' kind of pace.
The conversation Holmes has with his wife while she lies dying in her bed is a masterpiece of really mature human communication, it's not sappy or sentimental, it's just heartbreaking in its honesty.
Men who could speak while they gnawed at the scenery.......
Alas, Dead Heist, while at least struggling to patch some back-story onto the main characters in the first half, totally abandons anything but pointless dialog in the second and forgets more or less what the heck is the point of a storyline anyway.
The cast of course is not exactly 1st class material: Big Daddy Kane is okay, Brandon Hardin manages to pull off quite an okay performance while D. J. Naylor seems way too nice to be the battle-hardened veteran and Traci Dinwiddie Â dunno, she mouths the gun-blasts in the final battle, as if to dub them ... meh.
The first thing that is somewhat dolorous in Dead Heist is that the zombies are nicely introduced while rolling the front credits, but then forgotten for about an hour Â and when they are brought back you'd wish the wait would have been worth it.
Surely, zombies usually need a good 12-gauge to the head to keel over Â but while it has been of course done a hundred times it is a far more "believable" than killing them with a shot through the heart.
Amusingly, while Bone Crusher and E-40 are advertised as staring in it, yet they aren't in the movie for very long-Bone Crusher appears in the beginning as a patron in a strip club so tame it could have passed for MTV's "The Grind", then disappears.
The dialogue is foul and quite hilarious for it, and while the plot is meager at best, there is something infectious (truly no pun intended) about the way everyone involved gives it their all.
The actors were really good and the writers were brilliant.I can't count the number of times I almost fell of my chair while watching Two Guys And A Girl.It's very sad that they canceled it :'( .By the way the last episode was kind a silly.They could have made another were everybody chooses a different path like in Friends.
So while I am glad I saw it, its far beneath her ability and talent, and ditto Jean Reno.
You know you're in trouble when a song starts in the middle of a movie and the story stops developing for a while: They do so here because they want to stay faithful to the romcom genre and DÃ©calage horaire / Jet Lag is a French take on a distinct American genre.
Rose is having terrible make-up on but seems to be excellent in make-up; FÃ©lix has set up a company of deep-frozen food he sells to supermarkets while his unfulfilled dream is it to become a star-studded chef.
I caught this movie quite by accident one night while watching someone else's satellite TV.
As Rose she is funny and touching, while Reno as Felix provides all the right ingredients for her to bounce off, and their> chemistry is extremely successful.
Anyway, while Gaynor as Esther Blodgett-turned-Vicki Lester is quite winning, she has a full-time job overcoming the triteness of this obvious rags-to-riches story and narrowly succeeds by the skin of her teeth.
Adolphe Menjou who created the Charles Bickford studio executive part and, especially, Lionel Stander as the publicity agent later played by Jack Carson, shine in their subordinate but finely tuned roles, helping to counter-balance the banal tendencies of the script, while May Robson's spiky but wise, benevolent granny, Clara (Auntie Em) Blandick's acidulous aunt, Elizabeth Jenns' actress paramour, Andy Devine's true-blue friend, and Edgar Kennedy's pop get caught up soundly in the film's cliches.
I think that Jean Reno is doing a pretty witty Dustin Hoffman, while Juliette Binoche is Julia Roberts as Midnight Cowgirl.
This movie says yes to both, and grab it while you can.
Thompson's assured directon shows signs of maturity since "La buche", while her writing is as astute as ever.
He has reached his peak, and while still near the top, he has become a headache and problem to his studio because of his drinking the past several years.
However, while on their way, aside from a group of men wanting to kill the witness, they attempt a supposed shortcut just off of Route 66, which inevitably spells death.
The undead are four prisoners/murderers that were slaughtered while working on a road crew several years earlier.
This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while.
Horst Frank is a lot of fun to watch as the deranged, yet urbane bad guy, while George Eastman is good and nasty too.
Then, Gaynor becomes Hollywood's newest star sensation (as "Vicki Lester") while March (as "Mr. Lester")'s star sets...  David O. Selznick's version of "What Price Hollywood?"
It's a straightforward attempt to cobble together a cheap movie, while putting no time or effort into it, and drawing in enough patrons to make a profit.
The other scientists look over John Agar's shoulder while he reads a particularly puzzling plaque and rattles off allusions to The Gilgamesh Epic.
Competently directed by Virgil Vogel, with a fanciful and intriguing script by Lazslo Gorog, handsome photography by Ellis Carter, admirably sincere acting from a solid cast (Agar is his usual reliably stalwart self while the lovely Cynthia Patrick makes for a charming heroine and Alan Napier has a grand time as an evil high priest), a steady, if less than stirring pace, nifty and impressive special effects (the matte paintings are beautiful), a properly eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere, funky monster make-up by Bud Westmore (the Mole People are truly gnarly-looking subhuman beasts), a rousing last reel revolt by the Mole People against their mean oppressors, and a surprisingly downbeat ending, this baby sizes up as a hugely enjoyable golden oldie fantasy horror picture.
Nice supporting work from Adolphe Menjou as a Hollywood producer, and Lionel Stander is just poisonous as the vile Libby, who, while justifiably fed up with March and his chronic drinking and star tantrums, has not a sympathetic bone in his body.
May Robson as the Grandma is good also, but a little tiresome after a while (I think it's more how her character was written than her acting abilities).
A group of Archaeologists discover a strange world while exploring in a part of India.
And, while Ritai's goals were laudable, his methods for achieving them were questionable.
It took me quite a while to get out of it.
Meanwhile, the team members of the mountain patrol were fighting for their own life while hunting the poachers.
Written and directed by Chuan Lu from China and sponsored in part by National Geographic the film was distributed as 'travel/foreign places/environmental issues' product, and while it satisfies those designations, it resonates as a story that is not only based on fact, but one that opens our eyes to another way of life in a very remote area.
If you like thought-provoking, eerie, movies involving alien abduction then this may be well worth your while.
He fights a constant psychological battle, on the one hand coming up with evidence that he really was abducted by aliens, while otherwise trying to refute the experience with other explanations.
Makes up for an interesting read, but the downside is, that the book becomes very repetitive after a while.
Strieber keeps on going over the same events that happened on two nights in such a way that after a while he really isn't adding anything new.
Sometimes Strieber devoted a whole chapter in the book to a certain anecdote, while in the movie it gets reduced to nothing more than one line of dialogue (obviously carrying a lot more weight than you'd at first imagine).
Norman's decline is very fast, while Vicki's ascent into glory is even faster.
He just recently got his girlfriend pregnant and she wants an abortion while Flip sees things differently.
The man who helped Flip gets shot by a cop and soon dies while Flip weeps for his fallen comrade who he's known for all of ten minutes.
She is a great comic actress, doing impressions of Hepburn, Garbo, and West while serving snacks at a party and trying to get noticed.
I don't think I have ever rolled my eyes more while watching a movie.
I was actually angered while watching this movie, not at society (like with Do The Right Thing) but with the filmmakers themselves.
Eisenman is and always will be my favourite actor, as I practically grew up with up, while watching him on screen.
Regardless, it still gave me one of the best laughs I've had in a while.
The whole film is full of ridiculous moments like survivors sliding across from one building to another on a telephone wire (one guy shoots a gun at an Ant while on the wire & guess what?
The Ants themselves look poor, the CGI work is terrible while the actual on-set models are so stiff & lifeless the poor actors have to jump around & roll around on the floor while holding a plastic Ant to try & create the illusion that it's attacking them, they don't & it doesn't.
C. Thomas Howell & Martin Kove are better then this while Stella Stevens seems to be having fun & puts in a reasonable performance.
The first has a clever climax; while the second deals with complex issues in a sombre way, leaving the third to close this dynamic in its own unique fashion.
Basically, a witty script and superb actors' play make me watch the 1978 "La Cage Aux Folles" original over and over, while bland adaptation with weak acting of "The Birdcage" spoils the brilliant script.
Jayston managed to bring the character to life as none before of after him has managed; the viewer never has the feeling that he "plays", that he is artificial; he really becomes Rochester while on screen and looks like he feels any line and any movement he is acting.
According to him, they believe that her ex was tied and bleeding to death, while he laid there and witnessed his soon to be new wife's rape and murder.
It occurred the first time in 1945's "Conflict", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title.
As bizarre and strange as it may sound, it's very entertaining and most definitely held my attention while I was watching.
Alexis Smith is elegant while Barbara Stanwyck exudes just the right combination of believability to carry off a difficult role brilliantly.
She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey's precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called "The Angel of Death",was done while she was sick.
After she becomes a lesbian, she visits a bar where lesbians hang out called "LesBos".But it is being bought by Persians and as a spoof of the movie "300", the lesbians fight the persians while Garrison finds a secret of her own about the persian leader.It's alright but not the best South Park episode.
However, I felt that D-Yikes was, while nothing special in the South Park spectrum, a well done episode.
By talking to these scientist the only thing she does is raise her own anxiety while making her movie a Green Peace Platform thats message will most likely be ignored.
Finally, while I can understand that there may be some repercussions from vinyl use, I am not sure if I totally buy every lurid detail I was fed.
This inability to rank risk is why we spend soooo much time and money focusing on small issues while completely ignoring the big picture.
We need to recognize the progress that's been made and continue to partner with industry to drive further improvements in safety while acknowledging that the products of chemistry have had a vast influence on making our everyday lives better.
This is a great film and i would urge everyone who is not afraid to stray from blockbusters once in a while to see it.
but in this movie, chapelle's reduced to playing the silly black sidekick, danny devito is given NOTHING to work with, and macdonald is so unfunny i found myself thinking about cleaning house while the video was on.
I literally fell out of my chair while watching it in the theater.
Now who can really argue with a movie that manages to work in Ed Wood without totally Screwing itself and while still being good?
I managed to rent this movie from a local Blockbuster and watch it at home a few days ago, and, while this movie wasn't a comedic masterpiece, it wasn't a bad movie either, in fact, it was actually a quite funny movie at some points.
Overall, if you happen to watch this movie, while you won't get a laugh a minute experience, you won't be disappointed with the movie either, as it's one of those good, funny movies that you could watch to waste away a boring day.
As Rusty and Willard find out, they decide to up the ransom and try to make Crock pay for her bad deeds while the two friends are being pursued by the police, having to pay a crazy mortician Grover to help them in the plan, and make fake notes and videos with the kidnapper saying he'll kill Willard if he doesn't get his five million!
But things get complicated when the dog gets away and returns home Toto-style, all the while signs of a scuffle and a ransom note ("Pay us one million dollars or he's a dead dog") are left behind, leaving Miss Crock and the police to believe that Willard was kidnapped.
Stritch is a stitch - she plays a vain old woman but does it in a hilariously bombastic way while managing to create sympathy for her mean character.
Screwed does not take itself seriously, and as a result is able to work around a script that, while witty and clever, is not exceedingly original.
Talk shows swing from one extreme to the other, some saying their glad that the Mexicans are gone while others struggle to stay on the air with a skeleton crew (many camera operators were Mexicans).
Part documentary, part comedy, part social commentary, "A Day Without A Mexican" successfully entertains the audience with seemingly blundering Americans ignorant of the extent to which Latinos contribute to the economy and society of California, while simultaneously calling attention to the alienation and discrimination hurled at this ethnic group on a daily basis.
Indeed, the film is filled with unique takes on staple ideas of the revenge/slasher film, all the while finding the human truth to the actions of those involved and delivered with a combination of hand-held realism and wistful detachment.
Yet, it is at times extremely harrowing, uncomfortable and unsettling - not because of excessive amounts of gore (while the film contains violence, it is the weight of the violence and not flashy blood and guts that carry impact), but because of the way the events unfold.
While I'm not sure how much impact this film has on people who aren't from, or at least very familiar with, life in California, I think it speaks massive volumes all while maintaining a very witty and fun sense of humor about itself.
I've always said that I'm amazed at how the migrant workers are forced to work brutal, manual labor for wages that barely allow them to survive, while people like lawyers and actors are paid millions and millions of dollars.
Shot very effectively in a style somewhere between Italian neo-realism, early Scorsese and even Cassavettes improv but with a flavor all its own, it doesn't matter that one of the plot twists is very obvious (so obvious, in fact, I'm not even sure that it's even meant to be a twist) because co-writer Paddy Considine is such a riveting yet natural presence in the lead: he's able to be genuinely threatening while keeping it absolutely real, creating a very believable monster.
Mario Landi's PATRICK STILL LIVES is a weird little film that is weak on pretty much every level - but still manages to be entertaining and pretty fun to watch...  Patrick is the victim of an unfortunate (and kinda hilarious...)accident: while standing by the side of the road, he's randomly hit in the face with a bottle that a passing motorist chucks out of his window, leaving poor Patrick in a coma, but with telekinetic powers (!!??!!)
Why, for once, couldn't it be East, the story of the West boys' privileged counterparts - rich kids in sharp suits exchanging sharp talk while getting into trouble in sleek, expensive Sydney?
The extent of his good intentions can be seen by his willingness to wear a cap decorated with chicken wings while making clucking jokes at his own expense.
While you may think that this is a silly concept; Aliens crash land on earth, adapt to the culture, and eventually succeed and prosper, all the while averting capture and deportation by diligent and determined civil serpents of the renowned INS, only to be suddenly rescued by their own kind and returned to their home planet where Beldar is tried and convicted for losing his space ship.
I admit I have not seen the movie in a while but I was just thinking about Laraine Newman from doing some reading about the group Devo (its a long story) and I just realized that she really got screwed not getting the role that she played on the TV show.
When they go back to there planet, Beldar used his talents from Earth to stop a monster, while singing Soft Cell's "Tained Love".
The simple oft-trod tale of revenge for a right undone - in this case an English ex-soldier's return to his northern country hamlet for some bloody justice for the crimes committed against his slow-minded younger brother by a local drug- dealing hooligan and his cronies, while away on duty - is a cinematic chestnut offering many devices for the filmmaker to employ, namely the flashback narrative (here done in grainy B&W 8mm home-movie style adding to the gritty verisimilitude permeating the pulp noir at hand) and the anti-hero protagonist (Considine giving an implosively blistering performance of furious retribution), Richard, "Anthony's brother" - as he is constantly referred to in trembly depositions by each member of the doomed thugs as if whispering a ghost's name - begins his five day (attributed by the title cards employed) spree of justice.
After a good twenty minutes, half of the redneck population is already dead, while the local doctor and dumb sheriff are still cleaning up the blood of the first victim.
There's a scene of a couple making out in a car, while the radio plays a song (sung by the director?)
Dead Man's Shoes has been compared to Get Carter by critics, which while a good comparison, Dead Man's Shoes is a different breed of revenge film.
The locations chosen capture the actual places represented so that the whole has the verisimilitude of a documentary film, even while the spectator is drawn into the lives of the characters whose stories are being told.
The time just flew by while we watched the movie, which makes me feel like I didn't waste my time.
I have waited for this film to come out for quite a while now, I missed it at cinema as the mainstream cinemas didn't show it and I had to wait for the DVD to come out which it did on Monday.
The Image version features jaunty period music well selected for individual sequences, while the Kino release features music by a group called the Alloy Orchestra that I find mostly jarring and inappropriate, to put it politely.
(The version I saw also had a fantastic 'new' score by Carl Davis that added considerably to the atmosphere while supporting the action.)
try connecting the dots to david lynch while passing through alex de la iglesia territory and you'll be on the right track.
You get the feeling while watching this thing that all of the characters are moving in slow motion with no sense of time.
I saw this film while in Iceland this summer.
We begin to sense the escape's ultimate futility on the pre-dawn Wilshire roof top while an odd collection of passengers line up two-by-two for the first leg of their voyage to sanctuary in a water rich hidden valley of Antarctica.
Fortunatly there was an EMT and firefighter on a boat that pulled me while helpless to safety.
Ok,I'll have to admit that it's dated now (look at the clothes...)but that same sad feeling that creeps slowly into your head while watching this movie is still there!
The angle is that, while Long Tack Sam traveled in the same circuit at other vaudeville artists who are globally known, he is unknown - totally forgotten.
Comprehending Long Tack Sam's background, his narrow escape from a life of obscurity and poverty, his entrenched optimism, and his ability to bridge cultures while astutely producing a popular stage act, may be difficult for those addicted to special effects and the emotional manipulation of fictional contrivance.
We must learn to love our freedom while we still have it.
McQueen was the typical "good looking" lead while Hoffman was part of the new wave of "serious" actors.
Franklin J. Schaffner's direction is inspiring, as is most of the work he did while at the top of his game.
I still remember this movie through the eyes of a 12 year old girl and while I may not be a good critic of quality acting & scripts, I do know that this movie has haunted me since I was 12.
The premise was horrible and while the idea of spoofing all the different personas (frat boy, virgin, introvert, sensitive guy, the artist) was initially an inspired one, that was blown by the awful actors portraying these people.
That is if the sting of "Daisy Does America" hasn't worn off....  "10 Items or Less" establishes all the same clichÃ©s of being a grocery clerk that any common customer could see while wrangling this menagerie of failed auditions for Mad TV under the frayed control of manager Leslie, who assumes ownership of the family store after his father dies in a supposedly comedic fashion (a heart attack that knocks over a display stand, with the nearby employee fixing the stand first before helping the fallen owner).
Even though this show probably wont come back i enjoyed it while it lasted and think that it had a lot of potential.
Matthew Perry's character is supposed to represent bureaucratical society, while Chris Farley embodies the lower class American "pioneer."
Even the fact that the Aly character could be mean to her mother while trying to be sensitive to Ramona seemed real to me because kids and parents do lock horns at times in ways that are truly baffling.
In the film To Be Fat like Me, directed by Douglas Barr, high school student Alyson Schimdt (Kaley Cuoco) is injured while competing for a college scholarship in a girls' softball game.
During the game in which a college scout comes to see her, Ali's leg is injured, while sliding to a base.
An opportunity to make a documentary to win a scholarship is presented to her, and while watching her brother get bullied because of his weight, she decides that she will go undercover as a fat girl to prove that weight has nothing to do with popularity.
She befriends another fat girl, and her friend a "geek", and a friendship blossoms, all the while, she hides that she is doing the documentary and that she is really a thin, popular, pretty girl.
All the while the author, who himself has the personality of a stone and wallows in his own self pity, tries to sleep with them.
I saw that film when i studied films in england, i liked the director's techniques with his subjects.First of all he provokes them in order to get more informations from them, second he manages to become intimate to the viewer with his monologues that take the form of a confession.Many commented that his life is pathetic, maybe so, but it takes courage to expose to the public some very 'personal' moments.Many people might comment about the ethics of documentary, because sometimes he seems to abuse some of his subjects, or even mock them,i have a specific scene in my mind:When he interviews one of the so called patriots,inside a snack bar he pans his camera and while we listen to the 'patriotic credo' we watch another man dressed like a clown.I think this is a film that deserves to be seen because it is a prerequisite for people who enjoy BIG BROTHER and other similar assortments, that victimize their subjects sometimes to the extreme.Compared to those SHERMAN'S MARCH is very innocent much more entertaining though.8/10
It took a while to think about this documentary, and it opens up thoughts of life and love.
It seems that I've hit an awkward patch, in that my last several choices for a family movie (The 40 Year Old Virgin, The Weather Man and, most recently, The Squid and the Whale), while great films all, were not exactly family appropriate.
It becomes more obvious, especially near the end, that the mother cares all about the children, and little for their father, while the father cares all about the marriage, and little for the children.
He attatches himself to the older son because he tries to emulate his father, and thus reads what books he's told are good, and passes those he's told are not; watches what movies his father likes while avoiding those his father doesn't; thinks and speaks how his father would, when it's obvious he knows almost nothing about what he's talking about.
The New York in this film, while a little older, feels similar to that of The Royal Tenenmbaums.
The film may based on real experiences of writer/director Noah Baumbach, but it could be about any family alienated by a society that is at once trying to lead them in a direction while neglecting them on the process of coping with the journey.
Made for less than two million dollars according to estimates, The Squid And The Whale, while certainly not the best film I have invested my time in, is exactly the kind of production the American studio system needs to invest more in, not less.
Unfortunately, while keeping the length of the film to a minimum and editing out all but the most important details keeps the film from being excruciating, it is still terribly slow.
A little while into the movie we find out that the wife has been having an affair for four years, along with a few short string of guys.
It seems a miserable household to be in, and while it doesn't mention if he was having an affair, it seems very plausible this must have occurred.
The youngest child, while not uncommon, swears far too much even in front of his parents who don't do much to stop him.
"It's an ambiguous ending," Walt Berkman (Jesse Eisenberg) tells his slow-witted girlfriend Sophie, and while he's talking about Kafka's "Metamorphosis," he could easily be referencing "The Squid and the Whale."
And while the emphasis here--as in Anderson's "Royal Tenenbaums"--is a dysfunctional family, Baumbach wisely keeps us intimately invested in the small cast, thus tightening both the dramatic and comedic effect.
And so it occurs with all the characters: Laura Linney is marvelous in the difficult role she gets to play, but rage gets into her twice; Jesse Eisenberg (from the underrated "Roger Dodger") has one very strong scene of shouting, while he sadly looks lost for the rest of the movie, accurately portraying the complex Walt.
The Squid and the Whale looks as if it was written in two weeks, while high on coke or something turned in by a college sophomore, who pulled an all-nighter on the last day to write an assignment.
Bernard is a selfish, cheap and jealous decadent writer that rationalizes every attitude in his family and life and does not accept "philistines" - people that do not read books or watch movies, while the unfaithful Joan is growing as a writer and has no problems with "philistines".
Joan, while a little unsympathetic here and there, is a real human and one who maintains her composure when its clear her writing career is on the rise even if her family is about to implode.
Bernard, a very sardonic critical yet loving man, is taking it very internally despite his sarcastic remarks about everything to his sons as a sounding board in his attempt to keep his boys together by a joint custody agreement with Joan by taking a fixer-upper brownstone across the park while he deals with the likelihood that his new book will never be published.
Added to the mix is Lili (Paquin), a female writing student of Bernard's, who has a hidden agenda when Bernard invites her to share his new home as a roommate while the boys visit every other day with mixed results.
Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Frank's tennis instructor Ivan (a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is "Brother").
Bernard genuinely cares for his family but does things in such an ass-backward (and frugal) way that it is borderline heartbreaking especially his confounded loss of his status (both professionally and familially) that at one point I welled up with tears as he caressed a shelve of books while dropping Frank off with his mom.
Her new found success as a writer sets her off on a trail of confidence and joy, all the while understanding that her family still needs her very much.
Director Hough doesn't distinguish himself, the film feels like it was made-for-TV & while Howling IV: The Original Nightmare doesn't suffer from that indignity it has the dubious honour of going straight-to-video & you can see why.
It's not long before Marie and the ex-nun hide in the bell tower where Marie must wait outside while she summons the Werewolves with the bell.
On the lam, Frank will try to keep Maggie from harm as Reisner has his goons out searching for them while they also try to stay one step ahead of an invisible pursuer who has the upper hand.
The far inferior "Hollow Man 2" begins with the brutal slaying of a molecular biologist by a new Hollow Man who is desperately searching of a serum that will keep him alive while invisible.
Another biologist, previously working on a secret government project, is being protected by a detective who is forced to battle the transparent assassin while the government tries to track him down.
This makes about as much sense as making a re-make of "the Wizard of Oz" and focusing on what Uncle Henry and Aunty Em are doing while Dorothy is asleep.
Debra Winger (Dawn Anna) delivers a performance so amazing you feel as if you were right there with her while she was going through all these trying and horrible times.
Varla hopes to become the actress that her mother couldn't while dealing with the advances of Evie's gorgeous but microscopically-endowed son Stevie (Ron Mathews).
Well the film is a murder mystery and actually looks like an Indian film though it's a Hollywood film  It has Indian actors like Naseeruddin Shah, Amjad Khan, Dalip Tahil, Ratna Patak Shah  The film is a thriller and how a cop goes an investigates it  It touches on lots of topics on the problems cops face in India while solving cases albeit in a light manner  The film is serious and lighthearted at the right places and there is a nice balance  Direction is good Naseer essays his part with brilliance like always, One of India's finest actors Ratna Patak suits her role as his wife(in real life too she is his wife) Amjad Khan looks overweight and he is okay Dalip too is okay
Mediterranean playboys woo the affections of sexy tourists, and treat them to fun and frivolity aboard their yacht, while a ferocious tiger shark cleans up after them.
Overall, while the all-too-few shark attack scenes look convincing, and the multitude of semi-nude babes are distracting, it's a labour that will leave you feeling betrayed: this isn't a shark movie.
I've had a copy of this film for a long while but I've continually put off watching it, and the reason for that is simply down to the running time; 127 minutes is far, far too long for a silly and trashy Jaws rip off.
A good Saturday night pop corn flick if you have no plans to go out or if you just want to have a good time while cuddling in the couch.
However, while out swimming in the sea one morning, Patricia is devoured by a tintorera (tiger shark).
There is this great scene where the two agents are viewing a film of a KKK member, unhooded giving a speech while you see little kids walking around dressed like the clan.
Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book.
Taking a more scientific approach to homicide, these serial executioners test methods, techniques, poisons concentrations, and demographics all the while documenting their episodes on filmÂthe source for this filmmaker's canvas.
What made Head Case so appealing to me is that not only is it realistic, but the premise of it is entirely possible and I admit, while sitting in the theater enjoying this independent thriller, I ran through a mental list of my own neighbors.
However, while this film initially appears to be geared towards horror fans, it has the quite unique and mature characteristics of a dark comedy.
His pregnant wife is kidnapped, tortured and eventually held captive while the mob demand one last hit from Abraham which involves him taking out a host of people.
However, while TSS remains somber throughout, something strange happens in this low-budget little movie: half-way through the film, the characters get quite smart-ass-like, things get decidedly tongue-in-cheek, so for a moment there I thought this might become a sitcom.
The film is about two persons who become connected through death and how it in the end fulfills both of their wants and dreams that they couldn't have while they were still alive.
Her job during the heist is to divert the attention of the crowd from the treasure while it is taken away and she really has some wonderful scenes.
The film's ending is short but fitting, and while I felt it may have been lacking a bit, it's also forgivable when you take into consideration the rest of the film's quality.
The very ending offers one doozy of a marvelously ironic surprise plot twist while the arid desert setting adds to the overall creepy tone.
And while I'm sure I could go on and on praising the film, it's the acting that sets it apart from similar movies.
Katzin tells the story mostly from the POV of Page's character so that after a while the audience is actually identifying with her.
So while she's sticking her neck out, he's got her covered.
The movie was fairly easy to follow and was obviously about a frustrated writer of serial novels, called Sarah Morton, who took the advice of her publisher, John Bosload, to come up with a fresh idea for a new book while vacationing at the publishers villa in France.
Swimming Pool is about the author Sarah Morton played by Charlotte Rampling, and her run in with the daughter of her publisher named Julie played by Ludivine Sagnier, while Sarah stays are her publishers house to get settled into to writing a new book.
You can see at the end that it is actually the one person who is seeing herself in two roles while she is in France - one as a nymphomaniac, fun-loving, rebellious girl that she has lost and the other, stronger personality of a frustrated, rejected, bitter woman.
Swimming Pool follows Sarah Morton, a British author that travels to her publisher's dream home in France in order to have a rest while she works on her new book.
I think it was while watching "Dark Command," the John Wayne movie (though Claire Trevor gets first billing, for some reason), that I first realized Roy Rogers was really an excellent actor.
The first two episodes are hurt by a weak narrative (the protagonists appear to recall information they should not be privy to), while the last chapter is hurt by miscasting (neither Douglas nor Angeli looks quite comfortable doing these gymnastic moves).
Douglas is so mercurial in his angst that he's amusing unintentionally, while sullen Angeli is made up to look like a corpse in a silent movie.
but what this movie is about is basically a serial killer chases around scantly clad women who have the weird urge to take showers while they are running from the killer.
It carries its ludicrous premise with a conspicuous joie de vivre and at a boisterous pace, all while avoiding the doldrums of self-parody.
I really wonder if the actors knew the movie was as bad as it was while they were making it.
There are a number of flaws in the movies: day turns to night and night to day in the middle of scenes; characters' appearances change between cut away scenes, only two vampires combusted when exposed to daylight while many others walked around during the day without problems.
It definitely looks very artistic at times, for example, the scene where the killer strangles the girl in a hotel while the neon lights lighten the scene.
while most aspects of the film are just average and add to the b grade aesthetic, the cinematography is noteworthy.
I've complained about his work before with "Rush of Fear" (there's that word again), and while this isn't quite as awful, it does rank just as high on the idiocy scale.
While in the right hands the scenario of an innocent woman at the mercy of psychos with neither knowing where the other is can be (and has been) done effectively, here Klenhard's sloppy directing and slack writing wipe out any suspense and rack up the unsubtle hints ("You could scream for days and nobody could hear you") while the implausibilities steadily get in the way of any effectiveness - one of the few decent moments comes when Josie is trying to get out of the locked-up condo where most of the action takes place and finds she's trying to force the gate open with the plank the villains used to beat her friend to death, but then you're wondering why they dragged her corpse out of her apartment in the first place.
(when saleem is praying, the sikh friend is talking to him while sitting in front of him- IMPOSSIBLE!)
Deep Katdare's character falls in love simultaneously while another Muslim character does as well.
So while yes this show has sad scenes that a researcher could prevent, it is the hard facts of life in the Kalahari and it is an amazing show.
As an aside, while APu from the SImpsons is not the best (as in accurate) representation, his character is developed enough to be funny and is fairly well researched.
This was a hilarious portrayal of a Indian-American guy trying to come to terms with his heritage, all while his hormones were raging.
One, pretending to be lame asks to see the doctor, while the other does the thieving - but the doctor soon discovers the ruse and sends the "cripple" about his business.
This is one of the remarkable short comedies that Arbuckle turned out at the end of his contract at Keystone while he was in New Jersey, far from Sennett's grasp: quite possibly the best.
And while things get pretty crazy in the end, by then you're really enjoying the ride too much to mind.
The title track is sung with gusto while 'Let Yourself Go' and 'Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby' are other stand-out tracks.
All of the cars seemed to look the same after a while.
Also, while some would argue that it was unconscionable to let some of the animals die, I am inclined to disagree.
Freddy is stoic and a thoughtful, some-time thief, while Albert is talkative and an unremorseful kleptomaniac.
Maxwell had a great song with What Does It Take, while Jimmy Dorsey and his Orch.
Each meerkat has become a star in the series but some more than other such as loyal Shakespeare who may have died battling the Lazuli raiders while babysitting the infant pups.
Laurence Olivier, the prince of the made-up country of Carpathia in the Balkans, tells the following to Marilyn Monroe, the showgirl, at 95 minutes of the movie, in Magyar (Hungarian), while outside the door Magyar musicians play the violin:  (IMDB, in a very strange way, only allows sentences in English appear here.)
You can't take her eyes off of herÂa bit like watching the Indy 500 and secretly dreading yet anticipating a fatal crash, all the while captivated by the sheer beauty of the event.
It centers upon Grand Duke Charles, the Prince Regent of the Balkan state of Carpathia, who, while in London for the coronation of King George V, meets, and has a brief romance with, Elsie Marina, an American-born showgirl working in a London music-hall.
Worth the while.
Being less generous, it's easy to imagine instead that writer Peter Jones and writer/director Don Nardo continually didn't know where to go with their script, so every once in a while they used a variant of the old, "No, that was just a dream" tactic and basically started over.
This is made more amusing by the fact that while she's attractive enough, her facial structure makes her something like an attractive Neanderthal (I don't really mean that as insulting, but I'm sure it will be difficult to not take that way).
One of the best scenes shows a jet-black jaguar chasing our hero through the jungle while a group of homicidal headhunters hell-bent to kill our hero are in hot pursuit, too.
Update of 12/27/09: I was just reading through my reviews and have to update the fact that it took me a few days after posting the original for it to strike me that the film, while not racist, was sexist as heck.
Nathan Lane has the plum part as the flamboyant petulant drag queen (Albert) while Robin Williams as his partner Armand manages to maintain some credulity in otherwise outrageous and complicated situations.
Losing one eye and temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, Richard vows his vengeance and vents his frustration while searching for his wife by killing strippers in inventive ways.
The closeups give me the shivers because I can see the fleas flitting around their little bodies and there for a while one of them had ticks, which are normally group groomed off.
The sun's glare beats down and doesn't let up--right up to the courtroom scene where one watches a dazed Mastroianni in the foreground while the fans of the jury members move in constant motion in a soft-focus background.
Both share the same facility for 'false grip' that keeps the viewer attending to the action while at the same time mentally numbing one into a false sense that there is any meaning to the whole thing.
Ironically, while Saarsgard may have the most interesting character on paper, he's actually rather flat compared to Clarkson and Scott.
Elaine's motives are, while understandable, more unclear.
(And that title, while totally appropriate once you see the film, is a little too "high-brow" to do the movie any good.
And while the color cinematography is mostly conventional, sometimes it is beautifully stylistic.
And while I think it works well for the film, I certainly hope no ninth grader deems it a substitute for reading the actual epic.
His most recent screenplay 'The Dying Gaul' about a gay couple - one with AIDS - is a tribute to his lover, and while it is a brilliant script and is taken on by a top film producer Jeffrey Tishop (Campbell Scott), Jeffrey offers to buy the script for a million dollars IF Robert re-writes the script to make the couple a heterosexual one (see above for his reason).
But, when his defense attorney (Bai Ling) unearths puzzling contradictions in the case, she acts against the court and her country, joining him in a pulse-pounding race to find the true killerÂ while both of their lives hang in the balance!"
him.he must fight to free his name,all the while battling the corrupt Chinese government and justice system.this movie,like "Primal Fear,will have you on the edge of your seat,right to the end.Gere is brilliant in this here.i highly recommend it.for me,"Red Corner is mesmerizing.as a result,i give it 9/10
Additionally, it's a mostly believable project from start to finish, accurately sampling many of China's social staples through concepts such as "guanxi" (connections) and "da ge" (basically a nickname for somebody more respected than oneself), yet doesn't make any claims of exotica, while steering clear of clichÃ©s (save for Yuelin living with her kindly old grandmother).
Plus, eventually the truth does come out, and while it's pretty obvious who dunnit from the get go, this isn't the main point here.
& I didn't even know there was a inside joke about Cindy Sheehan in "Landslide"; guess the writers managed to read a newspaper while preparing this crap.
The acting, it was so bad, I laughed at half the comments the actors made to each other while they were buried under the landslide.
-pregnant woman to her friend while she gave birth under a pile of rubble after attending her own baby shower.
And when everyone's standing around running their yaps while a character they supposedly all care about lies suffering from snakebite--EVEN WHEN AN AMBULANCE IS WAITING TO TAKE HIM AWAY FOR TREATMENT--well...shoot.
Best of all: our heroes are sent to prison while attempting to flee the country at a heavily manned border.
But after a while you get used to it.
Oh, no: they're going to use a saw to open her womb and take out the baby while killing her.
Christopher Lambert does his naughty-schoolboy impression (he is one of the most wooden actors around), while his fellow inmates are a lot more believable, with Jeffery Combs playing a jittery-nutbag to perfection & Kurtwood Smith trying to be a sympathetic villain, but narrowly missing out on that role by Tom Towles.
But while trying to deal with a very real scenario, albeit in the 'global' future, the film crew and management had their own brush with Australian authorities regarding the use of 'local' talent preferentially on the Aussie set.
The ending is a little bland, with one version showing the Brennicks and baby, while the other shows Nino being terminated by the truck.
A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.
We are introduced to this penitentiary and its various pitfalls right from the start and while it's not hard to see where the film is going to go, it does at least make you wonder how it's going to get there.
It all boils down to a suitably over the top climax and while this might not be the best film ever made - its one hell of a lot of fun and I certainly recommend it!
In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.
As for the acting, it's typical of the silent era school of acting which means exaggerated facial expressions and dramatic body language and while it appears laughable and corny today, it was standard acting in its day.
Music fans should be happy someone bothered to capture the CBGBs scene while it still was a scene.
I picked it up in DVD to fill up an evening while my wife was away and what a pleasure it was to get engrossed in this brilliantly told tale of courage and adventure.
The only thing is most divorced moms in real life were bitter while Lucy was funny.
First off, I have to tell you I haven't read the poem and so wasn't aware of the gross changes made to the substance of the story that I found about while reading comments here.
And it ended with the people walking away, and the girl of the whole thing was all happy and stuff that she got away from the vamps, then she showed the guy an "upper" part of her leg and she ended up being bitten and she didn't know it and she bit the guy while kissing him and then it ended.
The definite sidesplitting sick highlight occurs when Lilith's vampire harem gets slaughtered while "Ballroom Blitz" blares away on the soundtrack.
VHS today while trying to find my 'Rat Race' VHS.
From what I understand, Diana didn't actually exist (although some think she may have been a composite of several girls in Rocky's life) and, while touching, the closing scene, where Rusty, Gar and Dozer visit the cemetery and Dozer puts flowers on the grave, is also a creation - Rocky's body was donated for medical research.
Cher as his mother, and Estelle Getty and Richard Dysart as her long-suffering parents; she is a rebel/Hell's Angel (apparently this was also true) and fights an uphill battle to give Rocky some kind of life while he still has the chance.
That same night, in Rome, Benigni's cabbie talks his holy passenger to death while making his confession, and, in Helsinki, a laid-off industrial worker and his colleagues (VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, Kuosmanen and Salmela) meet a taxi driver (PellonpÃ¤Ã¤) with rather more to be depressed about.
The confession theme in Italy had me rolling , while the story of the Helsinki cab driver was really tragic.
Night on Earth isn't quite as trippy as Jarmusch's later film; but it still oozes that odd sense of cool and while you're watching it you're constantly reminded that what you are seeing isn't just any film.
Part of the reason why this film is so odd is that all of the stories take place at the same time, which creates a very strange feeling while you're watching it.
I have never had the experience of seeing a 3-D movie before on the cinema, the only experience I have had with a 3-d film, only courtesy of some 3-d glasses coming free with a DVD, was Spy Kids 3-D, a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3-d.
The actors surprised me big time, Ray Winstone delivering actually one of his best performances in a long while, Angelina Jolie playing the slinky seductress to perfection and Anthony Hopkins being a joy to watch on screen.
Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character, but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie.
I myself had a taxicab experience like this while riding a cab in Berlin, so there's a personal connection for me.
He goes for cultural miscommunication in the New York story (which is the film's most tender and brotherly), the warring cultures within a city, where a black man (Giancarlo Esposito) who can't land a cab fights with his Puerto Rican girlfriend while being badly driven around by former circus clown (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in a goofy, charming performance).
What's so great about this movie is that it tells such different stories with such different characters who all have different pasts and intentions, each accommodating the place of action (even visually - in L.A. even the buildings appear to be candy-flavored, while in Helsinki the city is cold, drab, yet hopeful) and it all comes together to this huge picture, which reminds us that we are all different but all live on the same planet and know similar things about life, death and everything in-between.
Together, he and his uncle decide to settle the score with him and his mongrels,by taking something really important to them.The two dogs are humiliated and made fun of by the other neighborhood dogs.This is a great family movie with both sad and funny moments,especially with what happens to the dogs.Watch what becomes of two geese,who are drunk on wine.They're so busy laughing up a storm,slurring their speech and being clumsy,they don't know what will hit them.They had stolen the wine from the farmer,while he wasn't looking.All around great movie,I give it 91/2 * out of 10.Was this Hungary's version of a sequel for The Glacier Fox?Just asking,so please don't flame.
I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it.
The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly.
Overall, not my favorite D'Amato film - I'll still stick with BUIO OMEGA or EMANNUELLE IN America - but ANTHROPOPHAGOUS is worth a look too, if you go into it knowing that you'll have to wait a while for the "pay-off"... 8/10
A group of friends make a new acquaintance in Julie (Tisa Farrow) while vacationing in Greece; as they travel by boat, she convinces them to make a stopover on an island where she's supposed to meet some friends.
Later, when Carol finds Julie and Daniel kissing, she runs off and locks Julie in a cemetery, while all but Rita and Daniel go to find her.
The ideas and atmosphere of this film come from great, universal horror themes: a secluded and creepy Greek island, lost tourists, the tragic-horror story of a man who had to eat his wife and child in order to survive while lost at sea, a scary old mansion ...all wonderful horror (and with a genuinely tragic monster, the backbone of all great horror).
I got a possible explanation of this peculiar storyline, which is that they all were experiencing a 'paradigm shift' of reality itself, in which the forces of life and death, order and chaos, good and evil, arranged catastrophic events around them, because like the calm eye of a hurricane, it was required that they all survive in a central zone of safety while the whole world shifted around them, apparently because they were all 'prime movers' in the future history of humanity,(this belongs on the SciFi Channel) which the forces of darkness were trying to eliminate, while the forces of good shielded them, noticeably with 'Pre-Javu', the opposite of 'De Javu' where you flash backwards in time, they 'flashed forward' to get a heads up of their immediate future to avoid it subtily.
The theme is mature(sex/drugs), while still being light hearted and funny.
They couldn't even spring for some fancy flashing lights or decent music; tapping military-style drumbeats punctuate some of the scenes, while someone practicing a bass fiddle provides the rest of the music.
Is it wise to fire a gun onboard a spaceship while you're surrounded by all kinds of machinery that is keeping you alive?
Most of the film consists of close-ups of people standing around talking or arguing while sepia-colored walls float in the background.
The incredible talented of Sandra Bernhard and Laura San Giacomo (left with the incredible task of free-associating Shakespeare with a mentally deranged space woman) are wasted in this film that's so bad you might just enjoy it if you're in the mood to mock it while you're watching.
The idea of immortal vampire soldiers is fascinating, and the mystery is quite well-kept for a while ; but once the idea is exposed, there's nothing left.
The conflict - Primo the purist won't sell out to commercialism, while Secundo is seriously considering it, in the interest of staying in business.
Primo (Tony Shalhoub) Rather live for his art for fine food than be successful, while Secondo (Stanley Tucci) tries to keep Primo and himself above water while being tempted by the extravagances of owning a successful Restaurant.
The first time was during a benefit at a local independent movie house where several of the chefs from local italian restaurants cooked for the audience while Big Night was shown on the screen.
Consequently, while I watched this film for the second time it seemed like a new experience to me.
Secondo is definitely the business minded one in the family, while Primo is artistic and passionate about his cooking.
While we discover this mainly through their interaction, it is also subtlely exemplified in scenes such as the first sign of Secondo's pure delight while test driving a Cadillac, and Primo's abject happiness while discussing art and his passion for food with a woman with whom he is clearly smitten.
I liked the editing as well as the cast, Ian Holm was amazing, while Tony Shalhoub casted well here and not over-the-top, Stanley Tucci shows why he is underrated, with a good performance here.
Marc Anthony, Liev Schreiber and Isabella Rossellini were all good in supporting roles while i didn't like Minnie Driver here (she was much better in good will hunting).
Secondo is having problems committing to Phyllis and while its an important part of the film, its not the main focus.
It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, at least while you're watching the whole movie.
The mixture of experienced and young actors do a good job with believable performances, they look and act real, even when things seem to go absurd for a while.
But, like Billy Budd, he chose the victim path, and, while maintaining his love and devotion to the army, made himself a scapegoat.
Pershing actually appreciated aviation's potential to a real degree but he faced a budget-cutting congress while leading an army with too many senior officers who dimly recalled fighting Indians from the saddle.
Cooper is strongly expressive while exuding a powerful sense of personal morality and duty as Mitchell defined that quality.
Mr. McKenzie died tragically during the Spanish Civil War, shot while trying to rescue a wounded soldier.
Holding a magnifying glass in front of his camera lens while photographing a chimpanzee and pretending it was a giant ape was too advanced a leap for most movie ticket buyers.
I was lucky to just stumble upon it while zapping through the channels some 8-9 years ago.
But once that passes, and the idea that the hoax ends up working in showing what is great about the whole evolution and history of careers with directors in movies, as well as the kind of precision in restoring film, while at the same time putting some good touches to lampoon it.
Peter Jackson and co narrate the story in a completely straight, documentary style, while the inclusion of interviews with real life industry figures such as Harvey Weinstein, Leonard Maltin and Sam Neil lends the film an air of absolute authenticity (so much so that, as the DVD making-of reveals, for 24 hours after the initial showing of the film on TV, New Zealand thought it had discovered a lost national hero).
To say any more would be to spoil it, but needless to say much of the fun in Forgotten Silver comes from the fact that Peter Jackson and Costa Botes were so successful in pulling the wool over everyone's eyes while at the same time including absolutely outrageous details in McKenzie's life.
For, while McKenzie and his films may be bogus, the plight of old movies is not.
Mikael Piersbrandt is terrific as the policeman who believes he knows what's going on, but can't make his superiors listen, while Michael Kitchen as the hired British hitman, provides a splendid contrast as he sets about his task in a cool, professional and frighteningly unemotional way.
She could be a latter-day Mildred Rogers, leeching away at the man she despises while manipulating him into a frenzy.
Did someone in Australia put it in a bottle and throw it in the ocean toward the United States, drifting toward North America while we were plagued with "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "Mission Impossible 2"?
"Praise" is a slice-of-misery Aussie flick which looks into the waxing and waning of a relationship between a sexually obsessed woman and her taciturn and less experienced boyfriend while both languish in a life of self indulgence, sex, indolence, sex, drugs, sex and more sex.
"Praise" is one of those films which slip between the cracks of public consciousness for want of broad market appeal and entertainment value while garnering critical and industry acclaim for its ability to faithfully portray difficult human issues.
She's an animal, basically, an primal being totally devoid of any domestication, a wildebeast in perpetual heat, and our 'hero' Gordon is both repulsed and attracted (as we are) by Cynthia's blatancy - she's everything he's not, and eventually he submits to her warped energy, her whirlwind of over-indulgence (and of course her sexuality), and for a short while his life has meaning.
The ending may suggest that in some way he has won, or more likely that they are still at a standoff, even while the terrorists escalate the bombings.
The unknown Helen Wood, while not very convincing in her acting scenes, is one hell of a dancer.
It gets to become pretty obvious after a while, but at first it is wonderfully surreal, the sort of subtle gesture that Bunuel is an expert at doing.
More than anything... the movie is about old fashioned thrills, suspense, clever ideas and making the audience think while laughing.
Let me just say - I've been waiting for a bizarre independent film with horror and science fiction elements to come my way for a good while...
We put the movie in and saw one of most ridiculous, unreal and somehow touching movies I'd seen in a while.
This is a b&w and very low budget film made by one of the actors, Rusty Nails, and while it has its moments, it's merely OK.
"Wax" enhances life while critiquing it.
Watch it while you wrap the presents, and for a truly quixotic effect, watch it backwards when you unwrap them.
You see the enemy, you kill while spilling blood all over the place, get killed while spilling blood all over the place, and then you make people cry.
Interesting how horrible news is recited while the torn, bloody nightgowns are being exhibited, but just as the women begins to mend the holes, the radio switches to pleasant music.
This has to be a slur on psychology professors, because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points, and acting smug while doing so.
It takes a while before you begin to care about anyone, hell before you even really know who anyone is.
Then it takes a while to warm up to them.
Flags examines the lives of those in the photo who survived the battle, their reluctance to be called heroes, the demons that they faced while on the battlefield, the constant reminder to kill or be killed, the lies they have to tell to sell, and their sense of morality sacrificed for the lesser of two evils.
The acting is admirable all around: Ryan Phillipe creates a honourable figure persevering throughout war time while his friends fall away.
People are willing to accept heroes but only under fanfare and while they are still the flavour of the month.
If he continues to make films like this, with a flair for the ridiculous and an eye for action, then I think he will be around for a while.
My advice is to rent it while doing chores and stop and watch it during the good parts.
Today Hale and Kirstin are still soap actors, as was Roscoe Born until recently, while Hindman, Mulgrew, Bersen, Daniel Hugh Kelly and Helgenberger went on to TV series fame (Hindman was the neighbor in "Home Improvement").
His name and the prestige he bears draws a great many big named stars, while he touches on all the current issues of our world.
Drew and Libby have their hands full, raising Corky and their 2 other children, twenty-something Paige (Monique Lanier in Season 1, Tracey Needham in Season 2-4) who is Drew's child from a previous marriage, and 14 or 15 year old Rebecca "Becca" while trying to make ends meet on Drew's construction worker salary, and Libby's income as a secretary/clerical worker in an advertising agency.
It's a nice little piece of late night entertainment and while some episodes are obviously going to be better than others depending on the guests - you know you're always going to have a bit chuckle.
Anyway - after they finished painting them & went inside the camera remained outside, for several minutes - while the viewer did indeed "watch paint dry".
Andre Braugher, while consistently earnest, seemed to be portraying the last six characters I've seen him play.
It's a movie that is worth the watch while.
The film captures the same other-worldly quality of the short story (the scene with Treat Williams plays out almost like a feverish dream), while ably adapting it to the very different needs of a feature length film.
Carey while doing surveillance on Novak's apartment gets to peeping in on Malone next door.
Soon they're enjoying cocktails in a cozy bar and later at his place ("Suprise me," she tells him) while waiting for her auto to be delivered from an all-night shop.
Wearing it's Italian-American heart on it's blood-soaked sleeve, this derivative horror film has a group of unlikable, stupid jocks and their girlfriends getting killed by a masked killer while a retired police detective pairs up with a female one to try to find out who the murderer is.
Just make sure you leave the lights on while you're watching.
I feel so funky trying to explain this... it's like trying to explain a dream that really made deep sense to you while it was happening, but no one is really going to know what you are talking about in the morning: "And so, this snail gave me a hug, right, and said I was from the Land of the Lollipop People!
Weller,Goldblum, and Lithgow were all in magnificent form, while the script is a hilarious, surreal masterpiece of heroic absurdity.
Arnold is a creepy individual who, being older, and more experienced man in matters of sex, shows up one Sunday, while her family is away, to entice the young girl with his "smooth talk".
It's a rare style of movie in that while the characters take themselves seriously, the movie does not.
They had to start at ground zero and explain everything in as little time as possible while giving you the film's own story: a very formidibal task.
A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible!
"Laugh while you can, Monkey Boy!"
He's larger than life, wildly animated and extroverted, while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.
Peter Weller lends a perfect, dead-pan seriousness to the very 'out there' proceedings, while John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the fiendish Dr. Lizardo.
Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own.
The plot is about a group of scientists that have created a dimensional gateway to another universe called the Nexus, three people go through the gateway while the scientists watch through a camera on their suits.
Then the marines go around searching the base for the Alien while it slowly kills them off.
He enjoyed a rather large following while he was alive, and many still love him and his works.
I swear that I saw it on TV while I was working
The woman, can't remember her name, been a while since I've watched it.
People look like they are reading boards while speaking their lines.
The worst fights I have ever seen in any movie EVER (even jeff trent's suckerpunch in plan 9 looked more believable) Worst lighting I have ever seen (every shot featured 10-meter shadows even while people were talking ?)
stumbled on this one while watching amc one day.
Unfortunately, Withers and Toomey's wife, played by Mary Astor, fall in love when Withers stays with the couple for a while.
All three of those actors you already know are very strong, while Withers and Toomey are just decent (it doesn't help that the two resemble each other, so it can be easy to mix them up).
I can believe that many people who saw this pillaged it for their own work, while others were confused and bored.
Well, while both movies have no relation directly to each other, 100 Women is practically the same story... but with 'Women' that are only a couple of years older than the 'Girls'!
They actually make the conservatism the movie pokes at believable while not becoming too mocking or too caricaturistic.
He's about to be relieved because of erratic behavior, all the while he's flashing back on his wife's death in a London air-raid.
Having now seen all three of the collections released by the Directors Label series (including Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham) Gondry's work is the perfect addition to the series because he brings an element of bright imagination, and while all three directors are creative, his work is laced with a fancifulness that works as a thin patina, under which obvious intelligence lies.
I always saw him as a child in an adult body, and that's a compliment because only children can come up with such vivid imagination while exploring their world.
It does get a bit repetitive after a while.
Phillips might be channelling Disney's Wicked Queen as Livia, while Hurt is not too far off Kenneth Williams in Carry On Cleo in his portrayal of Caligua.
Ten minutes and I was screaming, "no no no" while reaching for a bottle of rat poison... for the cartoon rat on screen, not me.
Regarded as an idiot and of no threat to anyone, he alone remains standing while the poison flows and the daggers flash.
Thus while not entirely streamlined or satisfying, RTLS is a film with several points of interest and IMO one that deserves a better appreciation than it has thus far received.
The script is almost as junky as Larry Cohen's direction, while the actors are so wooden they could be used as stakes with just a quick sharpening of the head.
As usual, Van Damme makes a meal out of his role, while the two kids should have been taught a serious lesson on not to talk to strangers.
Also an interesting note from the commentary: Ray McKinnon, who plays Mad Wayne, won an Oscar for a short film he wrote and directed while filming this episode.
That first time I was a little bit disappointed and bored, but wasn't really 100% paying attention because I was tired and using the computer while watching.
It's just paradoxical that while this movie tried to make clichÃ©s laughable, it falls into every one of them at least once without noticing.
How the doors slam shut at just the right moment, how the perfect weapons are always available to the killer while the victim can't seem to find anything to protect himself or herself, and how the killer manages to let all the other promiscuous teenagers in the vicinity know that there is a killer on the loose and yet still manage to pick them off one by one.
Wes Craven's "Scream" was a strikingly dead-on persiflage of the Slasher genre while at the same time including enough scares to become more than just a parody, but an important part of that genre itself.
Although it apparently never quite caught on, they had applied for a patent while releasing their astoundingly beautiful and hysterically surreal and laugh-laden Boop masterpiece in 1934, the only Betty Boop color cartoon.
There's Albert and Armand's "maid" Agador Spartacus (Hank Azaria) who's almost as funny as Lane, and (while I don't want to give too much away) when you catch a glimpse of Hackman in drag near the end of the movie you'll be in stitches.
Unfortunately these ingredients are mixed so badly with stupid and clichÃ¨ lines and unopportune shots that I wonder what was the screenwriter thinking about while he wrote this cheese.I.e.
: what about the long and senseless scene of the soldier with the snake into his pants while the main character of the movie watch it and takes fun of him instead of helping?
Every once in a while a movie comes along that takes hold and never lets go.
Scenes with Molly Parker and Mary Louise Parker are tightly edited and executed nicely, while some other scenes just seem to be drawn out a bit too much, the pace is a slow one, with numerous subplots that attempt to liven the drama.
It's also the story of the church trying to tie down God (Gulliver) and He loves us enough to let us for a little while, but He knows our nature is to war and He has to stop it.
Bad production strategy and tactics show forth in a certain blandness to the background of the animations (among the least interesting background art in the Fleisher catalog) as well as a curious lack of unity to the story - for instance, the three spies, while providing excellent comic relief, seem to come from some other film entirely, and the plot twist they provide could have been constructed along other, more innovative lines.
I seem to remember one episode where they were responding to a house fire, and while they were working that fire, a house across the street also caught fire.
Gulliver is voiced by Sam Parker, while Jessica Dragonette & Lanny Ross sing for Princess Glory and Prince David.
The Living Dead Girl hinges somewhere between a love story (between two women, no less) and a very gory zombie flick and while it could easily have gone wrong, Rollin has created a film that will both shock, amuse and even touch you, and that's not something that can be said of many zombie movies!
after HÃ©lÃ¨ne discovered the bodies of the dead couple, she walks in on a naked Catherine playing the piano Â just look at the shot where she's sitting naked behind the piano, her back facing HÃ©lÃ¨ne), while in any given Franco movie you can't do anything but pass it off as cheap sleaze.
And while the blood-splattering, eye-popping, gut-munching, skull-splitting (by axe), throat-ripping (etc.)
And then the end-credits scroll the screen while a darkly ominous drone colours the soundtrack.
Friendship and love seem to be very powerful emotional drives within this plot while Rollin often cuts into this with a furious rage when he shows Catherine's eating habits.
You want to THROTTLE Lucy and the rest of the girls, save for Peppermint Patty, who at least tries to be nice to Charlie Brown, and give the rest of the gang a whop upside the head while imitating Cher in 'Moonstruck': "Snap out of it!"
Patty has the paints ready while Marcie fries the eggs!
However, I couldn't bear seeing Marcie (voice of Peter Robbins) having to boil all those Easter eggs herself while Peppermint Patty yelled at her so she would do it right.
I'm not a huge fan of her style of singing, but the behind the scenes look at life on the road was interesting enough, at least for a while.
Admittedly, the story became a bit monotonous after a while and there were extended scenes that really didn't seem necessary to the development of the story, but director Mark Rydell does manage to pull the viewer into Rose's life, and make her a sympathetic character.
She looked fantastic and while some of the 'concert' scenes were a bit long, overall the movie was very well done.
Better Midler gives a smashing, touching, tear-the-house-down dynamic and exhilarating Oscar-nominated performance as the Rose, a fabulously wealthy and successful popular rock superstar sensation who's been burnt-out and worn down by too much long hard time on the road, too much booze and drugs (Rose likes to swig Southern Comfort straight from the bottle while performing live on stage), too many cameras in her face and too much time spent recording songs in the studio at the expense of having a meaningful and fulfilling personal life, all of which leaves Rose feeling terribly lonely, unhappy and unloved.
Her manager scoffs at this notion more than once throughout the film as there is just too much at stake financially if she stops performing for a while.
Other than expensive rehab facilities which seldom work, a celeb usually has nobody else to turn to that can deal with them as a real person while they attempt to overcome their demons.
So later,while casually browsing the web, it occurred to me that very title of Tennessee William's play probably had much to do with adding that item to our general vocabulary.
And while Wyman seems a tad old for the part, Lawrence was an even odder choice.
What makes it uncanny is that this was written by Peter Manning Robinson while that was written by J. Peter Robinson.
This said, the Essanay shorts, while more inventive, better plotted and better realised than the Keystone work, initially aren't all that better.
High-energy physical slap-stick is what Chaplin did best at that time, and smacking around a huge mountain of a man while he dances carelessly around as only he can is certainly a treat to watch.
Still I decided to stick with it for a while and I am glad that I did.
7) while Dale and Flash argue outside his fathers old lab, which is now Zarkov's Lab, the door suddenly explodes outward... why?
John Ralston portrays Ming the "Benevolent Father" as a more modern dictator, using the planet's limited water supply to control the population and insisting all the while that he loves the people.
Anyway the evil princess gets fooled into thinking the I-mex is destroyed, although your average street magician could have been more convincing, and we find out daddy is alive (DUH) and is hooked up to some computer... maybe the one that maps your brain and would have told the bad guys not only where to locate it but also which pizza places would have delivered to the house while you were there...  You know some shows have plot holes, some have major ones (Professor stop making radios out of coconuts and fix the 2 foot hole in the boat) and some just say "We didn't actually care enough to hire writers, we just strung together a series of scenes and called it a pilot, we figure sci-fi viewer are dumb enough to watch anything"  Sigh.
If the comics could be "re-imagined" into the Buster Crabbe serials, and the serials into the animated series, and all of that into the 1980 movie while still keeping the whole Flash Gordon spirit, how hard would it be to make a TV series that can do the same?
Absolutely no effort whatsoever has been made: it's in focus and the microphone never creeps into shot as uninteresting things happen in the most uninteresting way possible while the cast are given uninteresting things to say to bulk out the running time to the contractually agreed length, but that's about it for exertion.
She's a primary school play version of a reporter while somehow Mick Dundee seems to have suddenly become a complete simpleton with no memory of all the things he encountered in the first two films in the hope that the audience will find his newfound ignorance funny rather than simply bewildering - it's not even as if his character took a whack to the head in a contrived plot point, it's just plain lazy writing.
while it's pitch black outside and you hear some explosions.
So it's off to Los Angeles for Mick, Sue and Mikey, where Sue quickly finds herself involved with the investigation of a shady new movie studio, while Mick gets work there as an extra on their latest production.
It's good work by Hogan, who has created a character who is so likable and real, while Hogan the actor, in retrospect, is destined to be under appreciated for it.
Now, while Pryor doesn't need someone to be funny, he's a riot on his own, Wilder and his style seemed to bring out an appreciate of Pryor's approach.
The plot is actually quite simple, they both flee New York to find a small peaceful town, then while finding work they are framed for a bank robbery and placed behind bars, then in the thick of it all they plan an escape while Wilder's character participates in the Prison Rodeo.
There's always something so sweet about Wilder and nervous about Pryor, one walking into obvious danger while the other one desperately tries to pull him out, that just worked in all their films.
The movie while obviously low-budget (no different than we'll say "My Beautiful Laundrette" or "Mona Lisa" at this particular time in UK productions), yet its concentration on the inherent drama of a confused and conflicted ex-Para in a non-empathetic society totally over-rode its budgetary limitations.
Tom as a cowboy is quite smooth, as demonstrated by his cigarette-rolling ability and flawless lip sync, while trying to impress cowgirl kitty.
For example, it's hilarious to see Tom pretending to sing "If you're ever down in Texas, look me up" and playing a guitar at the same time (while he hears the record), to seduce the cowgirl (the well known Toodles, Tom's passion), but Jerry makes the whole thing even funnier when he decides to give wings to his own sense of fun: he ruins Tom's plan by changing the speed on the record player, which causes Tom to sing very quickly and then extremely slowly (with a typical cowboy voice).
And much less fun to see them naked and frustrated while doing so.
I was forced to watch this movie in my English class after reading the play Antigone, and while the story itself is a classic, the movie is by far the most horrifying thing in the world.
The costuming is atrocious as well, because there was black leather and a Rolex on one character while the others wore colorful tunics and togas.
I watched some of the "original" first then switched over to the Troma version & while the original was pretty funny (unintentionally) anyway, the Troma version was probably much more funny.
Personally i think it is better to watch this in two parts because it gets tiresome after a while, much like i thought MST3K did.
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
It almost crosses that line between satire and blatant pandering at times (and actually may some could successfully argue), but the cruelty is not real and is obviously staged in Lost Reality, while in the examples it satirizes it is less staged and often presented as something else.
I might not want to go to a party with Peter Berlin but I really enjoyed hanging out with him for a while.
I recall how the music in Keoma drove some people crazy while others (like me) liked it.
In this fiasco, however, I get the feeling that the actors were blackmailed into doing this film, judging by the pained, or sometimes completely numb, expressions on their faces while they get themselves into moronic situations or deliver stilted, unrealistic lines.
Ultimately, however, I had to shut the damn thing off; I mean, I could feel brain cells committing suicide while I watched this travesty.
There is the crippled patriarch with a tendency to hold impromptu parties on the lawn, while listening to 78s of marching bands.
Sam Elliott, portraying a freelance photographer, takes pictures of animals at Ray Milland's island while also stopping to take photos of all the debris in the water.
Sam Elliott gives the best acting job as Pickett Smith while Joan Van Ark compliments him well as Grandpa's proper grandchild Karen.
Lynn Borden does a good job as a neglected housewife although that scene where she gets killed by the turtle - while having a conglomerate of crabs crawling up her legs - was the ultimate in low-budget cheese).
And when what's-his-name gets strangled by killer moss while hairy spiders eat him alive...well, that's just pure class.
I'm sure everyone had a good time while making it and it's a good time watching it.
The film involves a stupid family of rich, white, republican racists who do nothing but drink huge quantities of hard liquor while complaining about all the 'swamp noise'.
The pace is slow but intentionally so, as the froggies move in while a group of rich people (and Sam Elliot as the token environmentalist) are about to have a outdoor picnic.
For a while.
The only negative, and it is a small one, is that the score by Oscar winning composer Gabriel Yared (The English Patient, Betty Blue), while a lovely Woody-Allenesque jazz style, seems a little out of place with this film which often seems to be creating emotions that are in conflict to those the music suggests.
Daniels is exasperating while trying to shrink Moore's head, while Dzundza's fire is lighted by local spinster Mary Steenburgen, a closet chanteuse.
I was once only able to see Poirot if PBS's "Mystery" broadcast a series and they haven't for quite a while, several years in fact so I mistakenly thought that the Poirot series had ceased production about 10 years ago.
Owing more to the British thrillers such as the Quatermass films and the stark black and white horror films of Hammer (X The Unknown) or things like the Day the Earth Caught Fire (which while released 2 years later has similar feel) or Corridors of Blood, this is for a good chunk of the film a dark detective story of sorts as the monster remains hidden and the scientists try to figure out whats going on.
Giant radioactive monsters, while apparently preferring Tokyo, do occasionally attack other major cities, whether they be San Francisco in It Came from Beneath the Sea, or London, as in this movie.
The skin of the model is finely detailed, with hundreds of minute scales, while the back has a single row of serrated plates, a very realistic model in spite of the movie's low-budget pedigree.
The animation, mostly created by Peterson while in a wheelchair due to his advanced multiple sclerosis, is superb; Peterson had learned well from master craftsman O'Brien, and ensured the dinosaur's movements would seem natural, even giving it something of a personality.
The musical score, by Edwin Ashley, while not as bold as David Buttloph's for Beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage.
Once they buy the luggage store, one of them must man the store while the others work on the tunnel.
After a while, they realize that despite their larcenous plan, they would become much richer if they just continued running the business.
It takes a while to hit its stride, but it is an enjoyable comedy.
Williams learns from his son that his fiancÃ©e's parents (Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest) are straight-laced and ultra-conservative and will not be comfortable meeting his gay father or his even more flamboyant lover (Nathan Lane) and suggests Williams send Lane out of town while Hackman and Wiest are in town.
If you can find it in the video store on on TV watch it, it's worth your while.
(The thieves break open a water pipe while digging the tunnel; the original plan fizzles out when the phony business upstairs becomes an economic bonanza.)
So if you feel like putting your brain cells to rest for a while, and enjoy bleak futuristic pictures, urban violence, and indestructable tough guy anti-heroes, heres a movie you don't wanna sleep on.
Although not as fast-paced or well-lit as its sequel, Escape from LA, this movie works on the level that it is futuristic, without being TOO futuristic, and the main character is likeable, while being tough at the same time.
It suddenly occurred to me while watching this film that, whether by accident or design, I've seen a whole lot of films that star Rhys Ifans.
It is often said that you have to be from Swansea to truly enjoy this film, and while this is probably the case, friends of mine from all parts of the UK seem to enjoy it for the fun film that it is.
I would disagree - while it has some similarities such as prolific drug use and a bleak portrayal of a city in the United Kingdom (in this case Swansea, with bits of Port Talbot), the two films are quite different.
Their father, Fatty (Huw Ceredig) does work for local businessman and small-time gangster Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), and falls from a ladder and breaks his leg while working on a roof.
As a Swansea resident, I have to say that while the drug use in the film is exaggerated, it does capture the seedier side of Swansea quite well.
Netherless the plot is very predictable while the gags are highly unpretending.
My initial thoughts were that it would be a bit like another Danish romantic comedy, "Italian for Beginners", which, while I thought was a great film, was a bit bleak for me.
The chemistry between characters is electric and, while it is arguable that the film is a little contrived with an oh-so predictable ending, it's very much a "feel good" film.
Around the cinema people was laughing at all times, when they once in a while got hit by something they recognised.
And then once in a while there was a one liner, that made the whole cinema laugh.
yes but isn't lovely once in a while to believe, that somethings in the world, can make all the wrongs to rights?
And while I enjoy his recent crop of movies, many do not, which I think is a shame.
This has a lot of jokes, and while most are funny, some don't come off with good effect.
It's a great movie to watch with friends for the first time, especially for the fact that you will be quoting lines with them randomly for quite a while.
RGV must be praised those days for trying something new  One such adventure which was latter tried by others is DARNA MANA HAI(03) of having multiple stories in 1 film  The film however falls short of expectations though it's novel  The different stories are:  Sohail- Antra Bad and boring Acting- Sohail has nothing to do, Antra is okay  Sanjay- Shilpa This story lacks logic which can be ignored but the treatment could be better, especially the portions showing characters making weird faces while eating apples is too much Yet a decent story Shilpa acts very well while Sanjay is okay Rajpal leaves a mark  Vivek- Nana this is the best story and handled very well though it doesn't make much sense and they are flaws but that is forgiven The story makes for an edge of a seat story Acting wise Nana is brilliant as usual while Vivek too does a great job  Aftab- Isha This story which was latter made as GAYAB(03) has it's moments and the scenes involving Aftab and his power is well handled The culmination too is good but some people may not agree with the story Acting- Aftab is very good and Isha is okay  Saif- Boman This story is implausible but entertaining and well handled though flimsy Acting Boman and Saif are superb   Raghuvir Yadav This story is well handled too Acting- Raghuvir Yadav excels  The worst part of the film is the main story which appears too bad and the scenes involving the college friends are badly handled and the culmination of the film too is horrible  Amongst rest Sameera is okay, Gaurav leaves a mark Sushant is okay
This enlightening story magically and expertly relays an underlying theme that we all have the ability to see with the eyes of Divinity while intuitively being led to make conscious decisions for the highest good based on good character and values -such as dignity integrity, and unconditional love.
The acting, while amateurish, actually works for the story that the movie presents.
My girlfriend rented this movie because our friends hosted official screenings while we were out of the country, and we were somewhat curious.
I'd never heard of indigo children until a month ago, and just happened to see this movie while browsing at the video store.
While she is sitting, Don Ru (Ernesto GÃ³mez Cruz) is yelling at his son (Juan Manuel Bernal) for acting like "a queer" while he himself pursues Jimmy (Esteban Soberanes); and Susanita (Margarita Sanz) is getting her fortune told by Almita's (Hayek) mother, Catalina (MarÃ­a Rojo).
As the film progresses, Don Ru becomes intimate with a young sales boy while his machismo shifts to envelope his anger and resentment towards his wife and disapproving poet friend.
The movie Midaq Alley follows different characters to show everyday life for a small community in Mexico while the viewer sees the same story from a different perspective.
VERY MINOR SPOILERS GOING FORWARD:  The characters in both movie stick closely to the story, the Mexican version benefits from freedom of expression in many shots while the Egyptian version had to hint behaviours (homosexuality for example) to avoid censors scissors.
I've already mentioned the one with Rutilio, but others include the ones in which Guicho kisses Susana's feet while she sobs, Alma crumples Abel's letter and holds it near to her face, and of course Alma's despair in the final scene.
Each deals with what happened to that particular character while all have points in which they connect with the others.
I mean i cant remember much of this film because i saw it a while ago and its totally unmemorable but i think he meets a girl and decides to put off killing himself for a bit.
It communicates, in concert with another, the confusion, the narcissism, the energetic component, the mechanical component, all while "listening" to another tell a similar story.
Ah, I think, at last a film with the courage to laugh at death while looking it straight in the eye, to derive its humor from a wellspring of suffering, which, after all, is the best, truest form of humor.
"WILBUR wants to kill himself" deservedly worth your while.
Yes, it's very, very wrong for Wilbur and Alice to sleep together--but the film _asks_ us to consider what sorts of desires drive people, desires both for love and death, and to suggest that they might actually love one another (as Wilbur and Alice love Harbour) while still betraying them.
it lets the mix of guilt and understanding linger while still bowing to and honoring to a desire for life and intimate human contact.
In any case, I would think that the scene where Alice reacts to the news of Harbour's cancer (when they get back into the bookshop) would have been more than the price of admission/rental--one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a while.
She authentically expresses an irresistible yet forbidden attraction to Wilbur, while simultaneously displaying deep affection for Harbour, Wilbur's brother.
After a while I entirely forgot I was watching a film and just got totally absorbed by the screenplay while developing a deep sympathy for each and everyone of the characters.
What can I say... well first off this is John Fallon and Christian Veil's new film which has been in the making for a little while now.
Fans of those particular movies will find themselves at home with Deaden while others will be surprised that such a movie could be made.
Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown.
Heads are cracked, teeth are lost, limbs are broken, and there is the most inventive use of a pool cue that I've seen for a good while, and that will make your eyes water.
It took quite a while before I could figure out all of the pieces of this scheme and the people involved which I enjoy.
Like a previous poster, I availed of this film in Woolworths in Blackpool while on a trip and pretty flush for cash.
Amazingly the botched robbery is never reported to the police, so they just go on not believing him throughout the film while he's cruelly bullied by the vicious, er, school choirboys, one of who is nearly four foot tall.
OK so I think its good fun,  On the TECH level  I dug the look in some areas more then others such as some ext stuff looked Well videoish (Being that it was shot on video) while the some of the INT especially when Rane fights one of the main bad dudes (who was giving a blowie to other dude) hand to hand had a cool gritty look, Girlie Club also...I wish the latter look was kept throughout more, that's just my personal taste..There's a lot of gun action going on in this flick!
It's ultimately more fatal and destructive for a married man to be addicted to sex while he is supporting a family.
His selfishness, and it is selfish to be a sex addict while being married with kids, is consuming him and further tearing down the ties of family bond.
However the other actors aren't so lucky, with Randi Brooks, Raymond J. Barry and Steven Lambert merely passable in their roles, while Lesley Ann Warren's performance borders on schitzophrenic, with neither her radical mood swings nor motivations ringing true.
Scripters and director James B. Harris have done their very best to destroy what was probably a good plot, based upon the novel "Blood on the Moon" by James Ellroy, about an obsessive serial killer whose love for a prudish, feminist poet type drives him to commit horrid crimes while an uptight detective hunts him in the name of all the disillusioned young women...................................well, maybe the plot wasn't so good to begin with, but certainly Harris and company have done a great job in smothering what value there may have been.
And while not reaching the heights of L.A.
Watch for a plot that while have some serious issues, is still passable and forgivably based on the movies final line.
Plus, while I like the star, Lionel Atwill, he had a habit of making films for crap studios.
  I started watching the movie while flipping through the channels procastinating from doing something actually worth time when I found this interesting.
The elders retain their culture and roots firmly, while the teenagers flirt with the modern dress and music from France and the United States.
In the movie we see that the youth in the village of Popenguine dress in a European style of clothing while there parents stay true to there culture and dress in the traditional clothing.
At times like an Afterschool Special (Nami inherited a mansion, she and her boyfriend check it out while the two computer nerds offer advice via computer download), at times purposely made to resemble a video game (Nami and her boyfriend enter each room of the mansion, get a key or other object, exit room via secret door, etc.
Claire introduces the boy as her sister: he is very clearly male (even while wearing a Communion dress), yet all the nuns and at least one priest automatically accept him as a girl.
Her presence incites the matriarch of the household; who takes it upon herself to use her sons (along with some other neighbourhood children) to torture and abuse Meg, while the case goes unreported.
The best he can think of doing is pretending to be in her game, while trying to find a way to help the tortured girls.
This movie is great in sense of a sad story, but believe me I spent my 1 hour in hell while watching it really in hell and I just want to say that some stories should remain untold, My body was shaking and sometimes I cried like a girl but I will not forgive my self that why I have seen it.

One day they're fighting in a bedroom, the next they've got a girl bound in the basement, tearing her clothes off, the next they're engaged in kiddie rape, while the Cruella DeVille mom urges things on.
However, sitting in judgment while watching the torture scenes I find myself drawn into their world because I too want to find the offspring of everyone involved and break every bone in their body and burn their skin and dismember their sexual organs.
We wonder how societies can turn and things like the Holocaust can happen, how the torture of terror suspects by our own current administration can take place while we all sit idly by.
Not committed by some entertaining movie-maniac like Freddy or Pinhead that cracks jokes while slaughtering folks, but by something that is a lot more frightening, more haunting and terrifying: an entirely normal human being.
Charles M. Schulz's typically warm and witty script milks the nifty premise for several very strong and sidesplitting belly laughs: Among the hilarious comic highlights are Linus fainting when Snoopy cuts up his beloved blanket, Snoopy smearing mud on Charlie Brown, Snoopy putting a white sheet, a belt, and shoes on Charlie Brown which makes him look like a ghost, Charlie Brown finally getting to kick the football while invisible, and Snoopy levitating the ever-snarky Lucy and leaving her up in the air.
But it's the older Sister that gets taken to the basement and strung up by her wrists as other kids begin to torment her, stripping her, torturing her, even raping her later, while the foster Mother encourages them on.
The events could actually happen to the victim, it's not just a psycho with an ax (which, while possible, is more fantasy than anything).
Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever).
I paused while writing my review to consider people who aren't fans of the show and what they will think, and I have kept those in mind.
The boys end up seeing the movie again, and Kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review.
Caution: while this film is animated, it is certainly not for the kiddies.
the jokes while repetitive (based on swearing or insulting someone) never get old and the genius of ideas such as "operation get behind the darkies" while being offensive are undeniably funny.
From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque "Up There," to the Les Miserables spoof, "La Resistance," South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.
Carey has a thankless part which he plays in a workmanlike way while Ansara tries to inject some flavor into his standard issue part.
Kitsch fans will enjoy checking out Muldaur's 70's clothing and home furnishings while scenery aficionados will appreciate the desert location filming.
Diana Muldaur, while lacking Rhonda Fleming's glamor, is actually more convincing in her role as the faithless wife.
Even though the characters are stereotypical, the script has obviously been written by someone who doesn't intend to contribute to the stereotypical view of the gay drag community, but who rather wanted to create characters that are lovable while at the same time shouting "don't take us seriously".
The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn't distract from the overall picture.
I saw it on broadcast television while in Portland.
I laughed so hard while watching this movie, I thought I was going to wet myself.
It is criminal that this bona fide classic never really made it past the main gates, while lesser films took the glory.
While in Monty Python, it's surrealistic landscapes, while funny and inventive, never really touches the views on offer here, What was essentially a quarry, is now landmarks of Britain, with bits of it sticking out all over the place.
Arthur Lowe is slowly turning into a parrot (which is then eaten by Spike Milligan), while his wife, the owner of her own death certificate, turns into a wardrobe.
Tweedy lord Ralph Richardson post-atomically mutates into a bed sitting room while sixtyish, uncombed Michael Hordern uses the state of general unrest to get into bed with Rita Tushingham.
The concept was kind of funny, but after a while the single joke got kind of thin.
When his son has just arrived home, Fields remarks, while standing besides the boy and crying wife, "But I don't suppose we'll have him with us long..." Then he walks out of frame, stands with one foot on a chair, looks directly into the camera, and exclaims: "O-h-once the c-ihity ge-hets i-hinto a bo-hoy's system ... he lo-hoses his a-hankerin' fo-hor the co-hountry."
I can honestly tell you that no line has made me laugh so uncontrollably hard in quite a while.
Fields exclaims while witnessing the snow-storm from his door.
I think it is unusual that while the other great film of this kind of style, The Silence of the Lambs, won the main 5 Oscars, Se7en received only 1 nomination and no wins.
There is another company that puts out a DVD which is better quality but apparently while the overall quality is better, the version of "The Dentist" is censored & has cheezy music added in.
The blue one provides a peaceful, benevolent strength, while the red one turns you into a ferocious killing machine.
A movie all the kids can see while the parents won't be bored.
The beginning to this movie was captivating, but after a while it starts to lose it's flair.
But it's just generic, which is fine but the outcome in every scene felt a bit flat because of it, like if you seen the trailer you will probably get the whole story down, but some of the sequences while being predictable was cool to watch, so it's sort of forgivable.
The animation seemed a bit weak even if it's based on a science fiction anime, but the musical score was awesome to listen to while Astro Boy does his thing.
Freeman is Detective Somerset, ready to take his retirement, while Pitt is Detective Mills, who has been hired to take on Somerset's job after the latter leaves the homicide section.
As such, it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non-mathematicians.
Reading the book beforehand is not necessary, but will definitely help you catch on to the story faster, as you will not sit there wondering what's up with these wacky Flatlanders while an important part of the plot is revealed.
What we get from the media is selective snippets of information and outright lies, while none of this bunch of mercenary hacks would even dream of questioning the soundness of the oligarchic plutocratic system we call democracy!
The story is essentially told from the corporations point of view through Angie and shows logic in their cost cutting measures, while at the same time presenting them as inexcusable.
In the film, Tchaikovsky occupies his time composing and teaching music to his pupils while studying music at the Conservatory, where he makes most of his friends.
The victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than Jesus in The Passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly.
After watching this short, I thought it was made sometime during the 1940's, but was completely shocked to see (while on IMDb) a release date of 1933.
Some of the scares are effectively frightening (there is one scene that should get to anyone who allows themselves to be scared), while others are silly, mostly due to poor make-up effects.
Some of the nitpicks (spoilers abound):  1) The main character video tapes someone in her bedroom holding a knife to her throat while she is sleeping (the intruder is the one holding her camera).
The plot was completely unbelievable (the hero remembered turns and potholes while blindfolded in the back of a van, allowing the other hero to find the house she was taken to by the bad guy).
`Se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance Â while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years.
Manhattan is viewed as the center of the universe while the Bronx (and they themselves) feel alienated from Manhattan and "making it."
However, these nocturnal wanderers also have to deal with some of the more sublime facets of race relation as Nestor Serrano as Fernando, aka Vinnie, a Puerto Rican gigolo tries to convince everyone, including himself, he's Italian, or Doug E. Doug as Willie blames every one of his problems on the fact he is black and moreover accuses other black people he meets of "selling out" or "ignoring {their} African roots" while he has never participated in one rally or learned a single fact about African Nationalism.
While this wonderful film rarely lets up on the laugh, it's also intelligent and inspiring, while at times heartbreaking.
Who knows what that genius might have led to, but while this film will never balance off what might have been, at least he was able to leave his mark with one great film.
This movie is so good because it manages to be funny while having some real good points.
Willie is a decent man who hasn't yet learned to get off his ass and work, while Fernando, who tries to pass for Italian is a straight up prick.
From Rance's nutty first entrance to the hilarious concluding plot twist, Serling managed to crank out his best comedy while buried under the stress of his third full season of production.
You know who you are, hang your heads in shame while you watch.
Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing.
But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.
I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.
At a mere 77 minutes, this delicious serving of pure hilarious cynicism still seems a bit long while you're watching it -- maybe because the writers at times invest too much in milking all they can from certain scenes.
March is Wally Cook, a reporter in hot water for writing about the Sultan of Brunai who in reality is a regular Joe working in New York with a wife who identifies him while he's making pronouncements.
Plays as well today as more than sixty years later which proves that while the people may have changed the media stays the same.
I say "high jinks ensue" deliberately, as my triteness has a purpose: ENJOY the dialogue and the comedic posturing and timing of some real pros, and I don't see how you won't burst three guts while watching this one.
Hecht takes it a step further and while the Morning Post reports the news faster and better than its rivals, it doesn't create the news.
Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow.
Dr. St. Luc & Nurse Forsythe discover the truth but while it may already be too late for Starline Tower & it's unfortunate residents they must stop the parasites from escaping the island & into the city where they will be all but impossible to stop...
He undresses while sticking out his tongue.
Writer/director David Cronenberg concocts an unsparingly bleak meditation on the horrors of mankind being reduced to sheer psychotic libido impulses (check out the scene with a homely fat middle-aged woman jumping a younger man while exclaiming "I'm hungry for love!")
Moreover, this picture comes through with several effectively nasty moments: the jolting opening with a deranged old scientist murdering his teenage mistress, cutting opening her abdomen, and pouring acid in her stomach prior to slitting his own throat; Betts being violated by a parasite while taking a bath, a parasite attacking Linsky by attaching itself to his face, and a brief, yet startling shot of two little kids on leashes walking on all fours and barking like dogs.
Robert Saad's plain cinematography presents a credible evocation of everyday pedestrian reality while the spare, chilling score does the shuddery trick.
and while that doesnt shed a whole lot of light on the film, it sure is a hell of a qoute :) the plot of Shivers, aka The Parasite Murders, revolves around a parasite which has been bred to heighten sexual desire and other primal instincts while dampening our mental awareness.
while it is obviously partly inspired by that film, and brilliantly reinterprets it for a new age and a new social strata, the tiresome zombies that stagger about like slugs are a little out of place, but fortunately it does not let the film down.
I'm reminded while watching Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill on the sci-fi channel something George A. Romero said recently about certain new horror directors: "They shot Faith Hill's last music video, and they think they're hot s***.
One guy runs around and around trying to escape the zombies but all the while keeps one hand on his Kenny Chesney looking cowboy hat to keep from losing it.No one in this film could act their way out of a wet paper bag.The plot and script were terrible and the special effects were as crappy as any I've seen.
Shame propels the young detective on to a journey through the Japanese society, in search of the gun all the while the gun is being used to commit crimes.
After the rain comes a warm summer day where the murder is caught while birds are chripping, flowers are growing and things feel more lively then when the heat wave was in effect.
In the scene where Murakami and Sato visit the scene of the second robbery, the sense of tragedy is brilliantly conveyed with a series of shots showing the house and garden empty, while we overhear neighbours whispering to each other about what has gone on.
As with most of Kurosawas movies, there are no simple conclusions - while there may be superficial 'morals' to his tales, look beneath and there are layers upon layers of complexity and ambiguity, but always within a context of his sympathetic humanism.
A police procedural in the classic film-noir tradition, the film stars Kurosawa-regular ToshirÃ´ Mifune as a young homicide detective whose firearm is pick-pocketed while on a bus.
Both individuals fell on hard times when their knapsacks were stolen: while the former took the crucial step towards law enforcement, the latter chose the opposite path, eventually becoming a thief and a wanted murderer.
Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc.
There's a certain sense of time and structure that sets apart Stray Dog from the numerous 'film-noirs' of American cinema of the period- while it contains the kind of determined edge and wit of those films, it also relies on portraying the people in this world as honestly as possible, however downtrodden things are (like Kurosawa's later film High & Low, location adds to the mood greatly).
The robber is eventually overpowered and handcuffed and Kurosawa composes a wonderful shot showing the two, unrecognisable and exhausted men arranged at either side of the frame in the foreground, like a mirror image, while a group of singing schoolchildren walk past in the background.
Kurosawa touched upon international influences to an unprecedented degree in Japanese film (the internationalist impulses of Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi or Mikio Naruse are just as deep and varied, but far more discreetly deployed), Kurosawa also skillfully highlights Japanese specifics (the rookie cop expecting to be fired, even accepting the possibility in an apologetic fashion, only to be assured that he will not be fired - this would not occur in a similar American setting), while always linking the same details to universals: honor, nobility, responsibility.
It tells the story of a policeman who, after experiencing the theft of his gun while travelling on a bus, embarks on an odyssey to retrieve it.
Script is based on actual event in San Jose, CA, in 1933, while vivid depiction of college boys from local parochial college leading the charge is also based on fact.
Also when the guy was shot between his legs while on the roof--Cool.
Every step of the way, it seems, Fosse is keeping up with Hoffman's vitality in this character of Bruce, and while the film provides some laughs, it also works as a serious treatise on what it means to try and have free speech in this country.
In 1976, while in a drama academy in Los Angeles, I had the misfortune to be chosen by Mr. Zarindast to act in the film (and I use the term loosely) Kill Alex, Kill.
All this substitution took place while I was in South America and was recalled to film additional scenes, after shooting had ended.
Hardcase and Fist are two crimefighters with very different styles - Hardcase is a gun-toting, maverick-yet-somehow-by-the-book white cop, while Fist is an enigmatic, inscrutable Chinese martial arts expert who eschews the use of firearms in line with the best traditions of movie cliche.
This short film occurs in January 13, 2001, where a Times war photographer -Harvey Jacobs (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd)- is wounded while witnessing a massacre at Nuevo Colon by terrorists.
These guys are literally dirtier while being less gritty.
the only gripe is sometimes the action is a little repetitive after a while but its only a small gripe.
You will see an awful lot of German soldiers hurling their weapons in the air as if they were made of plastic and jumping as high as possible while waving their arms.
A small group of soldiers to be court-marshaled for bad behavior while serving in WWII escape a German attack while being transfered by their superiors to be tried for their crimes.
Much of this film doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but you won't realize it doesn't make sense until after the movie's over, because while you're watching it it's easy to be distracted by the energy of the storytelling and film-making.
I was raised in the era of Clint Eastwood's Italian westerns and while this was a low budget Italian made film, it contains some of the elements that makes those movies so great.
I don't really know why they shot it in black and white but after a while it didn't bother me anymore.
Not only is it a great example of the kind of movie I go for, but I've been wanting to write something about it for a while now.
I imagine that's what Tarantino saw in it, its own sense of paying tribute to so many other war pictures while holding its own for a bunch of dudes watching a bunch of dudes go to extreme in Nazi-occupied France.
Fontanne (who was 44) coos and smiles as the Actress, while Lunt (39) plays the dolt who never knows if his wife his faithful.
Lunt lost the Oscar to a tie between Wallace Beery and Fredric March, while Fontanne lost to Helen Hayes (Marie Dressler was also nominated).
Field is terrific as the devoted wife who tirelessly works the field alongside her husband, while Bondi is amusing as the eccentric granny.
Apparently the critics are divided on this one, many calling it one of Jean Renior's greatest achievements, while others feel it only slightly above average.
The opening shot amounts to a wonderfully compelling hymnal to the land and those who toil there, while the rest of the movie attempts to follow through with that noble theme.
His name is Isadore J. Blanco and is the 17 year old that is featured while working out in the field.
When you take into consideration that this man hid his homosexuality for over thirty years, giving no clues of such to his fans while taking on very macho, leading male, and romantic roles in Hollywood, it proves what a truly remarkable, gifted, and wonderful performer Richard Chamberlain is and what a true inspiration he is to the acting community.
This film is often overlooked but if you can find it, it is well worth your while.
Having lived there for a while, this movie is a very accurate portrayal of the typical Austrian (yes, I know it's a generalization - there are always exceptions).
I really missed John Houseman in his role as Aaron Jastrow and while I consider the late Sir John Gielgud to have been a superb actor, I kept looking for Houseman.
As above, this is in a category all of it's own: while it has flaws they cannot take away from the overall impact of the story.
Mr. Bochner, while talented, simply could not fill the inspired, natural reading of the role by Jan-Michael Vincent.
One other minor quibble was that some of the Nazis had ridiculous Colonel-Klinkish accents while others spoke like Oxford-educated Americans, depending on how "evil" they were.
I own the tape sets and re-watch them every one in a while!
Jane Seymour is excellent as Natalie and John Gielgud perfect as Aaron as they play cat and mouse as American Jews stuck in Europe while Aaron's "good friend" Beck keeps tracking them.
I'm not a great "war movie" fan, but War and Remembrance succeeds in capturing the enormous scope of the Second World War while also telling the stories of personal sacrifice and heartbreaking tragedy.
Told from the points of view of the wife Helen, the husband Paul and the Czech immigrant Tasha, the story of the disintegration of a working-class British family from Margate while encountering newly-arrived refugee immigrants, makes for some gritty, gripping entertainment.
When his next door neighbor, Simon, gets robbed and beaten brutally, his friend Frank assigns Melvin to take care of his dog while he recovers.
Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example).
This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real.
My problem with this character (and the "problem" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly "changes" at the end, we're left to think, "Change?
One scene has the scarecrow planting a seed within the lusty daughter of Priest Uncle Thaddeus(Bruce Glover, appropriately hammy as a corrupt priest who reads lingerie magazines while alone in his church)as it explodes wooden branches from her skin.
There are some great killing scenes throughout the movie which make this a worth while watch.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
I watched the movie again the other day and, while I can see what I didn't like the first time, I think I was a little harsh in my initial opinion of the movie.
The story involves a group of young children sent off to live in the country while World War II raged outside their home, and they find themselves stuck living in an environment very unfriendly to children.
This is Narnia, and it is under control of the White Witch Jadis who is aware of a prophecy that four humans will put an end to her wintry empire, and sets out her minions against the children who have entered her world while bribing one of them -- the rebellious Edmund -- to join her as she holds him prisoner much like the witch in Hansel and Gretel did.
With much less gravitas than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA arrives much faster to its goal than the former does and the reason is that the books C. S. Lewis wrote are fairly slim volumes while J. R. R. Tolkien's book is a massive tome.
The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.
Four young children enter the timeless world of Narnia through the door of a wardrobe piece of furniture while playing hide-and-seek.
There's much to reflect on and much to simply enjoy - there's certainly enough to keep you thinking for a while, and that's always a good thing.
And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced.
Barney finds himself falling for pretty student reporter Bernadette (Felice Schachter) while Peyton spends the movie lusting after sexy but snooty Jane (Heather Thomas).
Those cheesy and sentimental ballads got to be a little much for me after a while, but they don't really erase the charm of this fun flick.
Everything today is Blood Gore and Violence, I liked the simpler films, the feel good movies once in a while.
Another "actress" takes the patented horror film shower scene while she talks with an "artist."
I watched this while having a few beers and i'm sorry but Screaming Dead is in a word 'dead' and no way could you ever say that this film is so bad it's good!
It's cool to see interesting movies once in a while and this one is certainly the one you can't miss.
Fosse uses a documentary-like approach, complete with black and white photography and a narrative device in which we see Bruce's long-suffering love (played heartbreakingly by Valerie Perrine, Lex Luthor's bikini-clad girlfriend in "Superman" [1978]) telling Bruce's story to a filmmaker while the actual events themselves are played out as flashbacks.
The film focuses on The Floorwalker, The Count, The Cure, and The Immigrant, while including clips of The Pawnbroker and The Adventurer.
FYI--Fortunately, while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin, there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd ("American Masters", Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius) and Buster Keaton (Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow)--both written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film.
The result is merriment that takes many forms, including physical contests at a picnic where Nugent finds himself the rival of Margaret's boyfriend while trying to lose for Susan's sake; a basketball game where he must champion her erstwhile beau from the bleachers; and family occasions where the dialogue turns frequently hilarious.
What ensues is a delightful comedy of errors as Richard squires Susan around town, while struggling to deal with an assistant district attorney (the suitably uptight Rudy Vallee) and Susan's own ex-boyfriend Jerry (Johnny Sands) as he falls in love with Margaret (and vice versa).
She says hello to him while he looks totally confused - and then there is pounding at his door.
Three women review their past lives while they wait for news that will change the future totally for one of them.
A second movie that came to mind while watching "Three Secrets" was "The Big Carnival" with its media circus of cynical reporters covering and exploiting a disaster.
Perhaps the most telling scene has Thomas, hands still bruised from "business" dealings, tapping out classical piano chords on a bar, while electronic music blares out in the background and his thuggish partners discuss how they are going to drive their next deal home.
It's based on James' Toback's 27-year-old American film "Fingers" which starred Harvey Keitel and which is much admired; I haven't seen the original but its hard to believe that Keitel was any better in the central role than Romain Duris (a look-alike for a young Daniel Day-Lewis for all you Brit-fanciers out there), who offers brutality, insensitivity and arrogance in most of his daily life, but with an undercurrent of melancholy and self-doubt that makes him one of the most real characters I've seen on screen in a while.
Tom's more cultured late mother, we can surmise, kept these two guys from descending into the gutter, while she was alive (we never meet her Â there are no flashbacks in this film).
With a renewed sense of purpose, Thomas begins taking lessons from a beautiful Chinese virtuoso while, at the same time, attempting to pull away from some of the more unsavory elements of his life (including his own derelict father who he keeps having to defend against recalcitrant debtors).
Set in Paris, this is a subtle, low-keyed study of a man fighting the demons of his own personality while trying to turn around a life that has veered perilously off its original course.
Besides it's a movie and I guess mistakes have to come once in a while, that's life.
The conspirators leaded by Hunter decide to eliminate President Hayes while in Seattle to inaugurate the cable wire transportation Skytran, and they hire the professional and seductive killer Nina Stahl (Ona Grauer) and her brother and hacker Evan Stahl (Aaron Grain).
The two stars work well off each other: Cooper is laconic but experienced and essentially honest, while Widmark is cynical and opportunistic yet effortlessly charming; interestingly, Cooper was often paired with younger but equally tough men around this time â such as Anthony Quinn in BLOWING WILD (1953), Widmark here, Burt Lancaster in VERA CRUZ (1954) and Charlton Heston in THE WRECK OF THE MARY DEARE (1959).
and while this film was fairly typical of the westerns he made during that period, with the exception of "High Noon" which won him an Oscar, it had a darker cast and a sinister undertone that perfectly fit the locations in Mexico where it was filmed.
My favorite scene is near the end of the film where Coop and his friends are fleeing from a hoard of Indians along a narrow trail that skirts the side of a mountain (perhaps special effects, perhaps a real place, I've often wondered), and someone has to stay behind to stand them off while the rest make it to safety.
Each character offers some sense of presence to the film; Cooper is able to portray the silent, strength of character person, while Widmark adds a philosophical, yet cynical, view of life in his role as Fiske, a gambler.
Three men (Gary Cooper as "Hooker"; Richard Widmark as "Fiske"; and Cameron Mitchell as "Daly) are stuck in a Mexican sea town while their ship is being repaired.
Fact is, he was a fine actor, and while never an "Oscar" winner or nominee won several equivalent Mexican awards in his career (see his thread on this board).
Coop and two other Americans heading around the cape to California, find themselves stranded in a hole in the wall village on the Mexican coast for several weeks while the ship they are sailing dropped anker for repairs.
There, while they have to wait, they are hired by Susan Hayward to free her husband stuck on a gold mine on a territory full of Apaches.
The scene that hits this point home is the one in which Cary Grant is confronting a Judge while his young daughter is in the room.
This intractable loss becomes the impetus for the rest of the story, as they come back to California and attempt to adopt while running a local newspaper.
The film winds you though these flashbacks while you wait to fall deeper into their despair, knowing it will happen.
The plot is revealed through flashbacks which happen while the Irene Dunne character is playing phonographs: the record spins and dissolves into the scene from the past.
Mind you, Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on, tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding, while Cary Grant is off to sleep, but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office.
Cary is an aspiring newspaperman who meets Irene while she's working in a record shop.
I have to say a few things got to me while watching it.
i think it was the longest match, Benoit tried a suicide dive but got whacked with a chair from Y2J, Jericho put him in the walls of Jericho while they were both on top of the ladder.
the two have a catfight and Vince comes down to separate them and has to carry Trish over his shoulder while Stephanie chases after them.
However, for a short while after viewing the movie the fist time around, I did keep an eye out for large snakes hanging out in trees whenever I went hiking or cannoning.
Lazaro, after loosing his father--look out for big snakes--and later his mother, lives alone in the jungle for a short while.
And if a movie can make me share a character's despondency and weep for a while, then that it is a GREAT movie.
By taking it slowing and showing the mundane aspects of their lives the viewer grows to care about the characters, especially the delightful Setsuko to such an extent that that I was smiling during flash backs showing her playing while simultaneously sobbing at her loss.
And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child.
It's really great to see an animated film deal with a very serious and tragic subject matter, once in a while.
I was warned about it being tragic but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotion that hit me while watching it.
It's kind of endearing to watch these guys so earnestly vie for first place while chasing imaginary bad guys and saving planted characters around the city.
Then while being stuck and bored in my hotel I decided to give it a try.
That is exactly what I did while watching this movie.
The Toy Man was eliminated for his shallow vanity and greed, while Nitro G was eliminated for his callous dis-concern for the little girl he was supposed to save.
(So, until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriend/wife/sister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head.)
And Zeffirelli here is still at the stage designing grand opera productions around the world, while still in his creative prime as a film maker.
He tries to convince the audience of his point while doing some impressions and showing a clip from Haiwatha's Rabbit Hunt.
Many scenes were actually just as I had imagined them while reading the books.
Director Kurt Neumann, while no stylist in the James Whale vein, effectively utilizes the setting's atmospheric potential.
Some episodes are childish and make you double up laughing while some are bleakly dark and adult, only the characters tell you it must be the same show.
And while the melodies are wonderful, the singing is awful.
In conclusion: Cowboy Bebop is just about as entertaining as staring a sack of (insert curse word which begins with "s" and ends with "t" here) while paint dries in the background.
I've been watching anime now for a while, but I come to Cowboy Bebop late.
The film is called "The runner" as Amiro's running ability is underlined three times in the filmÂfirst he runs behind the train and wins a psychological race over his peers, then he runs after a cyclist who tries to avoid paying him for the cool water and catches up with him, and finally running with a block of ice that he has bought while others try to rob him of it, against a backdrop of oil fires.
By the end of the film Amiro is reciting the alphabets he has learned in school while looking at the symbols of his quest to reach the unknown distant world, beyond his physical vision.
Davandeh revolves around an individual, while Aaab, Baad, Khaak is critical of society as seen through the eyes of a boy.
Davandeh leans towards veiled political criticism, while Aaab, Baad, Khaak is a pure social and psychological essay without obvious political undertones  Why is Naderi avoiding female characters?
The old Iran is crumbling, while Amiro, the child hero, rejects all of it as he "runs" metaphorically to survive.
I'm glad I ventured forth on a wind-swept night (while the trains weren't running no less) to see this movie.
It has to be one of the most under estimated films for a long while.
This film delivers enough shocks to keep you on the edge of your seat for a while.
On the positive side it tells it's story well enough I suppose & while it's not exceptional Long Time Dead is a well made film generally speaking.
Long time dead, A film in which a group of friends decide to have a night out, making out, getting high and dancing in the process, release a djinn (arabian Fire demon) accidentally while using a Ouija board.
The plot is pretty good and the way the students get killed is impressive, while many parts of the film can be quite scary.
The other bad part of the film is that we quite often see the characters running away from the evil demon which does get a bit annoying after a while.
Hav Plenty lacks a coherent story; the actors, while hype about their screen debut, are uninspired and apathetic; the characters make gross judgments despite being undeveloped; the main character, while apathetic in a curiously nihlistic way, is both passive and unemotional.
)Further, while the movie is deemed 'positive'--I guess because nobody gets killed--the dialogue actually reveals the writer's disturbing assumptions about Black women and their view of self.
Lastly, while props go out to Christopher Scott Cherot, for accomplishing the Van Peebles-ian task of writing, directing, editing and starring in his own film; Hav Plenty also suffered from the Van Peebles-ian lack of focus, direction and story development in a film that they write, direct and star in.
The line is said while she is talking on the phone to someone.
Blessed with a coloratura soprano from an early age, she was discovered by MGM chief Louis B. Mayer while a teenager, and was signed to a contract without the benefit of a screen test or drama lessons.
The acting is bad, the fighting is unconvincing while the bad guys stand waiting to be kicked or blasted.
You actually start feeling sorry for the bad guys after a while, which could have made for an interesting turn-around, but this movie unfortunately has nothing new to add.
Duck Tales frequently had very dynamic and imaginative stories while Darkwing Duck is sort of hit-and-miss.
Luis BuÃ±uel has precisely constructed a work that preys on our society's monotony, while at the same time pointing out the insanity that lies within all of us.
Perhaps in the end, it was the humor that let Bunuel alive, while its absence killed Pasolini.
The bourgeoisie family sat on toilets in the dining room and producing crap while having a conversation is fantastic, reflecting his opinion about the dominating class.
The film contains absurd, surreal incidents, like priests playing cards while smoking and drinking, parents reacting to postcards of famous buildings given their daughter by a stranger as they were obscene and a writer killing tens of people from his sniping-position at the roof of a building.
If you like 1930's Hollywood romantic comedy then this is a sweet, unassuming film, which, while not as memorable as many other films of Hollywood's golden age, is still worth a look.
Frank Albertson (an actor who deserved major stardom, but never achieved it) is a college buddy, while Kane Richmond is Novarro's nemesis.
The thing I liked the BEST, the song playing while the credits were rolling.
But every once in a while, you just have to have fun and break away from the formula.
It allows both the writers and the actors some freedom from having to continue to answer questions from previous episodes, while still allowing consistent character development.
The Genji and Heike gangs show down in a settlement named Utah, while a clichÃ© stoic gunman comes to the support of what's left of the community, inspired by Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western Django.
A very good first half hour gives way to long exposition in the middle hour, and while there are some genuinely nice moments its a little too plodding as it tries to cover one clichÃ© too many.
Best movie I've seen in a long while.
But while I do not believe in a "Miike Universe" that cross-references between different movies, there is most certainly a "Miike mood" which is the ability to range from pure hysterics to morbid fascination to disturbing reveals to good ol' fashioned fireworks.
For those of us who have seen Django, this movie will support your prejudices while allowing you to enjoy the fabulous cinematography, costumes, acting and scenery.
Miike pulled out the stops for this one giving us enough blood and guts to wonder what was coming next while allowing for his own unique style to peek through.
SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO, while it boasts some incredible production values (from the town itself to the pyrotechnics to some absolutely beautiful cinematography), suffers badly when it comes to story (YOJIMBO has been emulated so many times over the years that it must be tied with MOST DANGEROUS GAME by now) and character (it's impossible to pull for the hero because he's rarely little more than a bit player; we never get to know him to the degree that we do, say, Toshiro Mifune in YOJIMBO and SANJURO).
It feels kind of like the old west, except some characters are in cowboy garb while others are in what appears to be feudal Japanese American Indian gang war duds.
The creative script is intelligent enough to keep the attention of adults while still entertaining children.
The plot of "Heaven's Soldiers" revolves around a group of South and North Korean soldiers who make an unexpected trip through time to the past, while their countries are in feud with the United States over their joint development of a nuclear warhead.
Also, while this makes no sense, what makes even less sense is why such a small group goes there--and they have no backup plan!
I have heard that Tower of Evil is one of the films responsible for the decline of the British film industry in the 1970's; and while I don't know if this is true or not - having seen it, I can say that there's a good chance it is true.
(All of this while doctors attempt to break through the survivors' catatonia).
The story is great, and while its got some serious moments, its easy to follow and anyone can enjoy it.
Someone murders three of the hot and horny kids (while they're all naked).
They even have the obligatory young couple who disappear while making out in their car at the beginning.
And to make the whole thing more entertaining, they have the regular people in the town going about their lives while everything else is going on.
The song is the whole premise of the movie "The Bodyguard," while the movie itself is 2 hours of aimless garbage.
Even with a weak acting performance by singer Whitney Houston, this is a fabulous film as it gives up everything: a wonderful plot, fine chemistry between Kevin Costner and Ms. Houston, the reality of finding love while on the job, and an Academy Award show never to be forgotten!
They meet three men and it's kind of cozy for a while.
It's quite a different approach and frankly it becomes annoying after a while, though some of his lines are funny.
Accordingly, I have been watching episodes for some weeks, all the while entertaining high hopes that the humor would commence.
This programme is one of the best about and it certainly has been about for quite a while.
After a while, you don't really care if Banderas' character is going to die or not because his character has lost all the respect you had of it; and you don't care about Jolie's character anymore either because of what she's tried to do in the film.
Which it does, when Angelina turns into a prostitute again at the end - not a least bit worried by the love she says she carries for "Luis" - and offers herself to 4 or 5 men, while she already has a relationship with Luis and one with her pimp.
One can regret that she was chosen for the part, and while some may enjoy the view of her naked body, true film lovers will regret the choice of her for this role.
This is evidenced in the opening scene where Chuck, the video store guy, talks over the phone with a customer about zombie films (while "Plan Nine" plays on the TV, no less).
However, the plot and characters are underdeveloped while the sex scenes take center stage.
I have seen this film many times but each time i enjoy watching it, it's the best film I have ever seen, Antonio Banderas did his best , he's a Cuban man loving an American girl but there's a problem : She was such a lier girl and a thief as well .Simultaneously she was in love with another man so after a while she took all Banderas money and ran away, Banderas started to find her in order to kill her .He Employs a detective to do so but guess who the detective is : It's her lover missing her too and is searching for her.What would happen next?
how come they rent huge houses all over Cuba while being looked for by the police as the biggest public enemies?
Jolie succeeds in revealing every aspect of Bonnie's internal struggle to achieve personal authenticity while accepting a once-in-a-lifetime chance at true intimacy.
Well, while the film seems at first aggravatingly conventional, there are enough subversive digressions from the genre (beast-mollified-by-virtuous-beauty) that makes you rethink the point of the entire film.
Pedro will become a not so obscure object of desire of two women, passionate and strong-willed Paloma, the young wife of Don Andres and the kind and gentle Meche, whose father Pedro accidentally kills while doing the job for Don Andres.
Also, while showing the time lapse the director has neither taken enough care to show the discoloration of or changes in the sets used on the location, nor has he changed the make-ups of different actors who have aged by at least 10 years.
Enough attention has not been given while writing the screenplay which has made it a very slow-moving storyline.
Martin Scorsese directed and, though a few of his trademark touches are in evidence, his ultra-restrained atmosphere (while appropriate for the period) proves disenchanting as entertainment, turning his three star leads (Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder) into suffering, swooning waxworks.
then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass.
Matt Macoy then shows off his ability to shoot guns while blinking like a mad man.
The greatest movie adaptations are usually made from novels of the second or third rank, the adaptations of the greatest novels-The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, Ullysses, are not very good, while Dodsworth,and The Magnificent Ambersons are ranked among the classics.
However, while the story is upper-crust WASP, the visual imprints are his, and the violence is completely internal, emotional, equally if not more devastating.
I saw "The Aviator" a couple of days ago and while I still have Howard Hughes flying through my brain I felt the need to see again another Scorsese.
Best part of the movie - Shannon Lawson as the picture-perfect neighbor from hell - fake self-effacing humor, constant quotes, big smiles, while her daughter skulks silently in the background.
We all could sense the opening ticks of a time bomb, but when Janis's ex-husband drops their daughter off at home, Janis pulls up in - WHAT ELSE - an SUV, charges at the two of them at the gate and just goes off on her poor ex, while yanking the kid and practically throwing her back in the van.
While I have of course heard the name Mizoguchi Kenji, the only films of his that I have watched are Ugetsu (1953) and The New Tale of the Heike (1955) and while I did enjoy both of them, mainly the former, for the most part I did not have a particularly strong interest in watching Mizoguchi's films because at the time I was embroiled within the filmic worlds of Kitano Takeshi, Iwai Shunji, Miike Takashi, etc.
He is often criticized by later film viewers and critics because his women, while strong, only could find true security in the world of men by adaptation to the males around them.
Both Umekichi and Omocha, while being of complete different personalities, are both victims of their positions in society.
Umekichi (Yoko Umemura) is traditional and loyal to her patrons while her sister Omocha (Isuzu Yamada) is a pragmatist who uses men to her advantage even if it means deception and lies.
This could have allowed me time to refresh my drink, have a shot of jaegermeister, and do the lucky me dance while thinking there maybe is justice in this world.
Now while this is all super silly and bizarre, the film is even worse than you'd expect because the actors playing the morons are, in fact, real morons--in the form of the "comedy" team of Mitchell and Petrillo.
This film does go a long way toward proving that the French are actually RIGHT about Jerry Lewis, whilst offering up some of the silliest goof-ball antics and dialog I've seen in a while!
The logo at the beginning of 1952's "Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla" reveals that this is a "Realart Picture," and while I would certainly hesitate to call this film an instance of "real art," I can now attest that it IS real fun.
The chief's daughter, Nona (played by a pretty actress called only Charlita), falls for the charms of good-looking crooner Duke, while her 200-lb.
Only the characters in this movie aren't just spouting smug self conscious dialogue; they're getting off zombie head shots while they deliver the laughs.
Some side trivia: Martin and Lewis took Mitchell and Petrillo to court for stealing their act, but in court Mitchell stated that while Petrillo looking like Lewis was an act of God, Martin got a nose job to look more like Mitchell!
Mitchell had a some talent while, judging from this film, Petrillo had less then none.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  Flemming use to sell LSD while at school but this drug is called Blue Sunshine and everyone who took it then is now ten years later feeling the effects by having their hair fall out and becoming a homicidal maniac that kills anyone in their path.
But the best part of the movie are the scares- in major and minor keys... a man losing every hair on his head in one shot... a psychotic murderer forcing a woman's body BACK into a roaring fire as she tries to crawl out... a babysitter going insane while the children she's watching chant "We want Doctah Peppah!
The movie ends rather quickly, and while some people complain about this, I prefer a clean break over a drawn-out exposition-filled "wrap-up."
Beyond the acting, "Blue Sunshine" also contains some very creepy imagery, a nifty score that serves to heighten the overall mood of the movie and a tightly written script that manages to do what few movies have been able to do, create an effective and memorable anti-drug message while avoiding being overly preachy.
Lieberman's direction is allows the movie to move along at a good pace, allowing the movie to build slowly and the audience to get to know the characters while at the same time not being overly slow and boring.
BLUE SUNSHINE is one of those films that I've been meaning to get to for a while and just never got around to.
I wish I could have "been there" myself at this point in time, and after seeing this film I was able to "live in their painting" for just a little while.
And while we are at it - check out Chart Toppers - forty five songs - four hours of Indian MTV with no commercials.
After a while though he decides things are not going very well he decides to leaves.UUNTILL he saves a young girl from DEATH!
One night while coming back to his home he witnesses an accident.
Playwright Norman Krasna, who wrote, produced and directed this understated comedic drama, keeps matters moving briskly, while allowing scenes to develop properly by emphasizing the sharp dialogue, some of which is startling with its insight.
Written by the English novelist Frederick Raphael from his book, it was more than a little autobiographic, and carried the flavour of the 50s and 60s, while avoiding many of the clichÃ©s this period evokes.
Today, Cagney is still a household name, while William has unfortunately been forgotten, the victim of an A-picture career that peaked during the forbidden pre-Code era that never turned up on popular TV.
Best is the woodsman/survivalist guy leaving his young daughters at home and telling the oldest one what to do if anyone comes by the house while he's gone, and walking her through the steps to deal with strangers if they try to get into the house.
This has a rather ambiguous ending though, but other than that it's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that, that's because it's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate.
Viewers just have to give it a chance and get that 70's show off their minds while watching it.
I was at a Sex Pistols concert while you were listening to the Bay city Rollers in your Barbie jammies!"
And while we're on the topic of Tuesday, I'm sorry, but I remember the 80s fairly well, and while mohawks were in, whatever the hell she's attempting to do with it was not (to be honest, I think that actress refused to shave the sides of her head in the name of her part so they had to think of something else).
The funniest portrayal of the racial difference was the music playing while the father and the fiancÃ©e were riding together in a car.
Like when the sister takes a drink out of the refrigerator, shakes it up and drinks it while her mother makes a face.
There are a lot of laughs together with a subtext about colour not mattering, while at the same time trading on those differences, thus enabling the film to have its cake and eat it.
Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality.
But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious.
I think the director and writers found a happy medium that allowed issues to be raised while at the same time keeping the movie light-hearted, funny and entertaining.
Of course, while this is consistently amusing and funny, what we're mostly left with toward the end are the platitudes of mawkish sentimentality, of "rekindling the love we lost" that seem to always hobble the comedy of even the most outrageous of premises, as if the premise has been exhausted enough and becomes more of an "endearing love story" than a convivial comedy... Why is that?
It just sounds like your typical family drama, where someone wants to go their way, while others are trying to pull the whole family together.
I sat in the theater for a while after the credits rolled and then remained in a quiet space for some time in the car.
Probably more than the above, though, Rice Rhapsody comes in handy for watching with your mom or sisters during one of those family afternoons we get once in a while.
You'll feel immersed in the characters and situations in "The Education of Charlie Banks" and while it's ending doesn't exactly resolve anything, ultimately resembles reality a bit closer than the average coming-of-age story.
After a while, they tend to blend a bit together in my head and I am sure that the average viewer would get tired of the genre pretty quickly.
It caused a major uproar in 1974 and was actually considered a serious art film (for a while).
I found this tape while cleaning out my garage(must have been my dad's or something, I respect him much less now knowing he would watch some weak garbage like this).
If you are willing to forget that it seems unrealistic that a young lady sleeps with other women and men, while her husband encourages her to do so, you are in for a really sensual and - for guys, a very realistic - account of what an unreserved, 20 year old, bi-curious girl might really experience in Thailand; the country of erotic massages and exotic climate.
However, I was wrong; the film isn't boring, and while the focus is usually on sex; there actually is a story, and it actually is quite interesting!
This is a movie which I saw two years ago (I am a man) with a woman who suggested we'd watch it while in intimate circumstances.
All the while that Pierre is being introduced into HÃ©lÃ¨ne's bizarre world he is conflicted by his superego in the form of the Catholic Church: he is seen reciting catechism in the desert surrounded by a silent, nude Greek chorus a la Fellini.
But still, it's still worth while watching.
Sidarth finds out and after a while Sidarth makes Rahul decide, being boss of the agency or Seema.
From its very beginning, the beautiful B&W Cinematography of some of the most beautiful locations, just grabs you in keeps you interest, piquing it all the while that its story is unfolded.
Fortunately, while consistently attempting to maintain each character as a "timeless" figure in the film's ageless story, Dudley Nichols's screenplay avoids the usual stereotypes to which most amateur filmmakers would inevitably resort.
His mastery at containing emotions, while letting them seep through the audience, undiluted, gives this particular characterization extraordinary strength and complexity.
Instead, while his priest was neither alcoholic, nor adulterous, he displays an even greater weakness and flaw of character: lack of faith, profound self-doubt and abject cowardice.
Now if I could just get the movie theatre to stop playing crappy pop music while I wait for the previews.
been a fan of director Paul w.s anderson and statham for a while so keep up the good work guys.if you like blokes action films you wont be disappointed.
So unless you terribly mind turning your brains off to enjoy the show once in a while, chances are you'll have a blast watching Death Race.
The actors give the performances they need to give, while still having fun with their roles.
Jason Statham is the typical tough guy protagonist, while Joan Allen is the usual one-dimensional villain.
Otherwise, catch this one in the theater while you still can!
Casting him as the lead in any film brings certain expectationsÂbasically, that our muscled mofo will deliver a smackdown to the badguys while delivering some catchy one-liners.
As a result, the bloodshed that ensues is pedestrian and ineffectual (and even worse when played for ironic effect); while the outcome of "Death Race" is as predictable as you would expect, the total lack of B-movie charm (and fun) is simply unforgivable.
Stranded in this murk is Joan Allen, who, as the black-hearted warden Hennessy, seems to be channeling an androgynous cross between Louise Fletcher and Keanu Reeves, but is relegated to standing around watching monitors while delivering Anderson's subpar dialog.
But has anyone ever thought of racing cars... while in prison???
However, what Jensen finds out is that the man who killed his wife is in there, and he'll do whatever it takes to get back at him while still in there!
I, for one, (while reasonably coversant with history), have never thought about her early years on the throne, and the difficulty as a teenage monarch, of dealing with Mum and Parliament!
The influences from the racing video games are explicit, and well mastered - me, I fully felt as while playing "Death Rally".
Finally given a chance to showcase his creative talent when he is accepted as a participant in a SETI project to collect home videos to send into space, he limits his film to showing his apartment while rambling about his life and his video lacks poetry or self awareness.
This is a great story of human interaction and sibling connection while exploring the depths of the great space race and how it affected one boy's life.
You'll notice that most of the interesting commentary and clever interventions by the main character are made while shooting this movie, and that he is alone doing so.
Another clever idea in the movie is that there actually isn't many differences between the shots taken during the children hood of the guy (in the 70's) and the on taken in 2000, while he's 40.
But when saying the director wasn't doing hits off of a crack pipe while working is the best compliment to give a movie, that's still pretty bad.
The two roll around naked under covers in the most awkward positions possible while the guy grinds his loins and gives the most painful grimaces is the history of man.
This movie can serve as background noise while passing around the party dip and refilling the cold refreshments.
Although this historical biopic spends precious little time with romance, it does dwell most on the relationship between the couple as they go about the business of working to bring dignity to a tarnished monarchy while raising a family and doing what royal couples do.
The characters are very well developed and, while the movie doesn't justify Josh's actions, it does convey compassion for him.
In Illinois, while chasing a Djinn in an old building, Dean is attacked by the creature and faints.
The action in this feature was definitely entertaining, and the special power aspect gave rising to that of "Kung fu Hustle" while still retaining a realistic point of view.
I'm one of those guys who can enjoy a movie if you give me a running description of the movie while watching it - but, I also like watching alone at home.....the restroom is a LOT closer !!!
while the script is a model of clarity and fun that most writers would do well to emulate.
I actually identified more with youngest brother Grant, who at 17, just wanted to strum his guitar and enjoy his last summer before adulthood, while dad Bill preferred his son work.
Another sad moment comes in the now infamous footage of Lance riding his bike through the hills of Santa Barbara, while in voice-over, Bill reads a letter to his son explaining the destruction of the marriage and how he hopes one day he and his son can be friends.
I couldn't help but think that the star of one of the best movies I have seen in years could only manage a cheap house with her earnings while lesser actors in much lesser films earn millions.
Should the world now tolerate regimes that in the name of religion kill and torture while subverting the most basic individual rights?
It is the most pretentious film that I have seen in a long while.
The film starts with muted, almost sepia tones, and grayness, then exhibits flashes of color, here and there, while mostly staying in dark greens, blues, and browns.
She becomes a kind of "Everywoman" of the first half of the twentieth century, an era when countries worldwide repeatedly called men to war while women became casualties of the grief, poverty, and physical destruction left behind.
Alexis heads to America, while Eleni loses the children again after she is imprisoned.
As time passes we find that Eleni at a very early age has just given birth to twin boys while she has been sent away for the family's appearances: the father is the young son of the family.
He is kind of of Fonzi character driving fast in stolen cars while he tokes constantly.
Hollywood tries to emotionally seduce its audience, while Angelopoulos looks for means to occasionally distance his viewers from their emotional responses.
The tone is little uneven, with some of the older actors playing up the melodrama while the younger cast members take it all seriously, but the result is an enjoyable genre romp.
Once upon a time, while reviewing a director's reel, an agency creative laughingly remarked, "My God, it's like porno dialogue!"
The link to Mansfield Park (the book, not the movie) has been noted by some observers, with a story centered on the mischief some young people get up to while their parents are absent, and the trials this brings for the young protagonists.
The film while intellectual in bent, plays most of the scenes decidedly tongue in cheek which keeps the movie from feeling pretentious.
Graham is stellar in the title role, a girl who has had to deal with abuse and, while in reform school, awakens to more positive sexual experiences.
Also, while Beatrice Lillie had a long and remarkable career on stage, she made very, very few films so this is a rare opportunity to see her in action.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
She starts out a rather naive young bride who is dumped off in Paris by her older husband while he toots off to India for a year.
Francis plays a silly British wife who goes to Paris while her husband goes off to India.
I'm a Peruvian person who has been living abroad for two years, and this movie came to me just a while ago.
I was surprised to see Willie Best as the second cook attempting to pilfer a quail for himself early in the picture, while Andy Clyde worked his expressive face for maximum effect as hotel owner MacIvor.
The fatal script shortcomings of "Our Mutual Friend" appeared to me even more striking by contrast against another recent BBC release Â "Under The Greenwood Tree" (2005) Â which I had just viewed for the first time a short while previously.
There are few words that can describe a movie like this - one that generates great laughs at times while eliciting tears at others.
And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing.
The script appears to have been written by mentally disturbed monkeys the night before shooting (probably while they were getting stoned).
TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s .
I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.
After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.
The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie.
Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.
Raw sticks with the same people and gets a new person every once and a while.
Each character ties perfectly into the next, and while there can be many different sub plots going on at once, they are all connected somehow, and go together so smoothly.
Don't get me wrong, the show is still suspenseful as ever, while there are even some interesting non-terrorist related subplots.
Owen Wilson had probably the most out of style role while Willem Dafoe had a delicious screwball character opportunity.
The kid who is supposedly carrying the virus and his family take up a lot of screen time while it advances the main plot, but then they are written out and never mentioned again.
And not hitting anything while doing it.
The NSA dude who got capped in the New Orleans bar: So let me get this straight, an NSA officer is hanging out in a French Quarter bar with an unsecured laptop full of classified information, as well as an encryption device to access, all the while chatting away about it on an unsecured cell phone inside a bar full of complete freaking strangers?
Director-star Orson Welles also adapted Isak Dinesen's rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in China who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich, dying man, his terrible wife and a sailor-stud.
Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic "I Love Lucy" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.
Been meaning to give this one a watch for a while.
Oliver Stone was left with blood on his hands, while more murders were being linked to his masterpiece.
Secondly, Natural Born Killers shouldn't have inspired this much controversy because, while it often exaggerates to get its message across, it is realistic to the coreÂand why should realism be labeled controversial?
This is troubling, because while the film works hard to analyze the dubious process by which violent killers are turned into romantic heroes in the mass media, NBK seems unable to escape from the same orbit, ending with the killers as living happily ever after, justified by the brutality of their backgrounds, and morally superior to the prison officials and popular journalists who pursue them.
Interesting to me that the glorification of violence found everywhere in the thriller genre is taken to be safely neutral, while a powerful satire of glorification is condemned as, well, too violent.
The major contradiction in media culture now is that on the one hand, Natural Born Killers is reviled for inciting violence, while on the other hand, it is reviled for being _too obviously_ critical of media violence in a simplistic and unsubtle manner.
I actually know some of the folks in one of the vignettes and while they did a great job with what they were given I must say the first segment was truly - not good.
This is certainly the worst movie I've seen in a while.
It took me a while to find it but I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square.
It took me a while to find it bit I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square.
When the film ended, though, it was interesting to note that, while the women in the audience stood and put on their cardis and coats, the blokes sat quite still for a minute or so :-) .  
--Suddenly while in Luxembourg, and somehow with money, they wind up pouring bottles of wine all over prostitutes and letting the bread they have to just wind up in the tub and going down the drain with the wine.
--Hoping there would be a resolve to the story, instead after a naked woman can't have sex with them because she was crying over the memory of her late husband, the others just sit there naked and laugh while the camera zooms in on their genitals.
"What are the two subjects we can combine to evoke sympathy from a guilt-ridden audience while still being original in an annoying Paulie Shore kind of way?"
Love it or hate it, this is a movie made for an audience of African descent with the intentions of bridging the gap between both sides of the Atlantic while simultaneously forcing African Americans to question their ways and identity.
The leads weave a potent and convincing chemistry, both as lovers and as a long-married couple, while Berger lightly coaxes humour and an eccentric romance to the fore.
The second part is not as funny, but I almost wet myself while the aspiring director Bergman-wannabe shoots a number of scenes with his utterly talent-less wife, imitating every last cadre of a Bergman film!
Pablo Berger is the director and this is only his second film, but the work is of a mature creator, mastering the subject, with a deep understanding of the time the plot happens, with a strong hand in directing his actors, while leaving them enough space for creativity.
The script is slow, the dialogue juvenile & tacky and, while the actors do their best with it, the performances are most definitely lacking.
And while it wouldn't be fair to say they've gone downhill since (I love CMI, especially), this has to be the best of the Monkey Island games.
It's not the type of adventure game where you have to swordfight monsters every 2 seconds (although you do go through "swordfighting training" to learn some really funny insults) or listen while someone blabs on about how they're avenging the death of their great-grandfather's second cousin's sister's nephew's half-uncle once-removed, wasting your time with stories that don't have anything to do with the game.
It is the feeling I have never had while watching a movie.
I'm not normally into made-for-TV movies, but while I was visiting a friend tonight "Iron Jawed Angels" came on the television and within the first 10 minutes I was hooked.
Strange as it is, my friend and I realized these women were some of the most important and influential people in American political/civil rights history, and yet I would bet that very few people alive today can even name them, let alone talk about how they went on hunger strike while in prison and gave up comfortable lives for a cause greater than themselves.
Suffragettes in general were single-minded, serious women, not pouty little twits who mooned about on swings with leaves swirling all over them while hip-hop blasted.
The first while was a little slow, but sets the stage for the climax.
It's hard to get the full effect of how powerful this play is while sitting in one's living room.
His humor, the most intelligent work I have seen in a long time, is like the liquid itself, creating this bold texture while packing a powerful emotional punch.
The olives are the cast, giving just some extra to nibble on while you enjoy the entire drink.
His ability to contain himself while also giving us the emotional stress of being a first-time dad as well as loosing his best friend is Oscar worthy.
Goldblum is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine, while Huston proves that she still has the ability inside of her.
Director Duccio Tessari made the excellent Giallo 'The Bloodstained Butterfly' three years before this film, and the two share the same keenness to buck as many plotting trends as possible; as while this film firmly fits into the Giallo in terms of style, the plot takes the focus away from common Giallo elements such as sex and murder and puts it more on the characters and an intriguing plot involving amnesia.
While the plot does take a while to get going, once it does the film becomes a real thrill ride, and this both offsets the sombre tone of the first half and is hugely entertaining.
The characters were original, the replay value was high and the stages, while keeping a sense of the old game's traditions, were imaginative, especially the "City Escape" level.
At one point hilarious, sometimes even action-packed, while other times, you may feel a tear forming.
Alan Moyle creates a moving sophomore directorial effort, while Robin Johnson, Trini Alvarado, and Tim Curry shine in their well-developed roles.
At first, Pammy seems alarmed by Nikki, and her wacky habits (she casually eats flower petals, while Pammy looks on in bewilderment).
All the while, Nikki is developing her skills as a rock guitarist and singer.
For a while, Pammy and Nikki keep a step ahead of Pammy's father, and the law, in their pursuit of a free existence.
Their scenes while corny at times were on the most part touching When Nicki suffers a breakdown, I had tears in her eyes, because she was so convincing.
However, due to the many logical errors in the film, I can't recommend it as anything other than a time-passer--and only if you can manage to turn off your brain for a while while you watch.
For example, anytime she wears the college girl uniform (open shirt and skimpy mini mini skirt) she immediately gets naked like in the glorious scene at the confessional, and then while performing a striptease to tease the construction workers.
And while it may not have the special effects budget of a hollywood blockbuster, it does a great job with what it does have, a strong story and compelling characters.
A legendary whale bone that is said to have magical powers which gives any nautical creature the ability to breath on land while it's in their possession.
So they are forced to make an escape from the blood thirsty predator with a taste for mer-people with the help of a sea turtle named Cloud Strife, an octopus named Simon Belmont, a jumbo shrimp named Shinobi, and a manatee named Rosie O'Donnell, who they met while taking part amateur night of an oceanic strip club called Flippers, in the Arctic regions in order to earn some extra clams for their journey.
So if you love heartfelt stories that doesn't have nudity, cursing, pagan rituals, or fat chicks, that the whole family can sit down and watch while you visit your Alzheimer's stricken grandmother in the spare no expense, rest home of luxury you put her in... then this is the film for you.
More than entertainment, the movie is likely to touch a chord in the psyche of even the most jaded part of oneself, encouraging hope for change, while at the same time exploring the inevitable outcome pursuant to the present course as delineated by the characters personas.
It seems that every once and a while, an occasionally brilliant film will catch my attention in the late hours of the night (or the early hours of the morning, as it was in my case); I found that film in "He Was a Quiet Man," writer-director Frank A. Cappello's brilliantly acted, smartly written satire about that unlikely hero whose "heroic" act may not have been so heroic, and in fact masked an inner rage that may actually make him the villain.
Just let it haunt you for a while.
You just have to think harder than you usually do while watching a regular movie.
The world has changed, everything is shades of grey and certain people, who go through a lonely life without being understood, and while constantly being kicked around have a tendency to fade into the background.
The soundtrack leaves a little to be desired, and some of the cgi is a bit fake looking, but on the whole this is a character study that is well worth watching that, while leaving an ambiguous and somewhat dystopian ending is well worth checking out.
Christian Slater's latest and greatest effort (at least for a while) is A History of Violence without the graphic violence, Falling Down without the social commentary, and Office Space without the sagacious humour.
In every western movie you see somebody shooting with an old muzzle loader 5 miles and kick the rider from the horse; in every movie you see cowboys shooting from the hip, without aiming on a silver dollar thrown into the air, you guess, they hit, not to speak that villains do not get their opponents although they fire from close distance, let us say 20 centimeters, hundreds of broadsides, while the sheriff is shooting back with one single shot between the eyes of the five bandits.
"This town is like a wild animal in chains, Molly," says Marshal Calem Ware to his landlady while she fries his bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Scott is wounded and widely believed to have been killed, but comes back to settle scores, while his ex-wife (Angela Lansbury) who is now a singer and dancer in a burlesque company comes into town and does a quite revealing song and dance number.
The father drinks more and more and occasionally loses his job, while the religiously fanatical mother focuses on the growing daughter.
The two are summer vacationing at an upscale beach resort in the south of France (while dad works in Paris).
A subsequent sting from a jellyfish while swimming also leaves Chris physically scarred, further bruising her ego.
For a while that means forever taunting Vic and briefly taking her aggressions out on a vacationing German couple.
He's a rather crude arranger, while being a sublime painter at the same time.
Power and Young, two people very, very high on any "most beautiful" list, are so ethereally, incalculably gorgeous that it's hard to listen to a word they're saying while they're on screen.
Jeremy Irons is fabulous as always as the film within a film's director while Justin Theroux is perfectly cast as Dern's co-star.
In INLAND EMPIRE, characters cross over the threshold defining the limits of reality and fiction, co-exist with their other-world counterparts in one fluctuating existential plane and change wholly and completely from one scene to another, Lynch all the while serving up the kind of hallucinatory hell that cinema-goers have come to demand of him.
What is bad are the tiresome shots of darkened hallways, the constant entering into darkened rooms while the crappy electronic score kicks in (I guess we're supposed to feel a troubling eeriness in the air) in the background, and subtexted stage acts (in this case humans with fake rabbit heads) that don't enrich the story line, even though they are meant to thematize the breakdown in marital relations by showing how the language of married couples ceases to be communicative (gee, didn't T. S. Eliot already do this?).
So often did she go from one emotion to another while maintaining control of all of the nuances one would expect from reality.
I can't speak for the rest of the movie--as 90 minutes of unrelieved murky shots of Laura Dern looking distressed, while the dialogue-obscuring sound track of a B-movie organ drone desperately tries to create some kind of suspense--was all I could stand.
DL mocks the idea of the "real" while using the concept to slide in between worlds.
I will try my best to recount my thoughts while they are fresh, and incorporate what the film maker and actors had to say.
It is also one of the self- referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief.
It gets shown on TCM once and a while (good on them), this is where I had re-stumbled upon it after many, many years.
He tells the story of the year 1954 in which he while working on the set of a comedy.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
I Had seen the great Rupert on a religious channel that has been showing all the great Christmas movies like scrooge,and the bishops wife.and i loved it.its somewhat a Christmas movie about a family led by the great Jimmy Durante.and a squirrel named Rupert that shares the same household.the great Rupert also stars the dazzling and beautiful; Terry Moore(mighty Joe young)who i think looks great in this movie,playing jimmy Durante's daughter.if you like sentimental comedies,you will love the great Rupert.i totally recommend it.if you spot it on DVD buy it.i hate myself for passing it up as a dollar movie a while back,but i see it again I'm grabbing it.although I'm not sure its a public domain movie,its well worth repeated viewings,I'm not giving away the plot.no spoilers here.all i can say is watch it,you will love it.and its the first movie produced by the late great George Pal.10 out of 10.
But I think Eminem has some of the same emotional complexity and while he has the same death-wish kind've attitude, the rap game isn't as dangerous as it once was.
it is probably more comedic than family guy its successor in the fact that Family Guy is more, Here is the joke every one will understand it, while this is more, lets be discrete.
The script while trying to be serious is just awful, thats all that can be said....awful, just bloody awful.The script is devoid of interesting plot turns and any real creativity, if you gave a monkey a type writer the script for aquanoids would quickly churn out.
I caught this movie late at night while channel surfing and was immediately enthralled.
Initially seeming to be a tale about Nishi and his unrequited crush on Myon since childhood, this anime goes in all kaleidoscopic directions that leaves you breathless all the while.
As an avid follower of experimental cinema and anime I rarely get rewarded with solidly evolving features, but once in a while I strike gold and get to travel through the medium of rich expressionism dealing with both real life and fictional events in the utmost fascinating fashion.
Aside from feeling a genuinely exalting rush with its almost mosaic imagery and perfectly fitting music, I felt something else while viewing Mind Game and I attained a certain notion afterwards, which I don't see worth sharing, since I believe everyone who'll give this a watch will acquire on their own terms, levels and depth.
His acting in this film is excellent.Omar Epps and the rest of the cast are fairly good as well.The film is about four friends named Q,Bishop,Raheem and Steel who skip school one day, they find out afterwords that one of their peers was shot and killed while he tried to rob a store.After hearing about this, Bishop(Tupac) wants to do something crazy.So the four friends go and rob a store but Bishop ends up killing the owner.They then run into an alley where Tupac then kills Raheem.He threatens to kill Steel and Q if they tell anyone.The film then goes on with Q and Steel trying to hide from Bishop who is losing his mind and kills some more people, then frames Q for it.Q must prove his innocence and confront Bishop.Juice is a pretty good thriller with good performances and a good early 90's rap soundtrack.
it had been a long time since i had a headache watching a movie but i presume we should torture ourselves once in a while with such pathetic movies to appreciate the well-made ones.... the movie is about a simple constable of Punjab,nihaal singh(sunny deol) who is too sweet and innocent to be believed.
It's probably pretty forgettable, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.
Sex and violence appear to be the principal focus of Chung's attentions in DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART, but while the sex angle is exploited for all it's worth - Lai lounges around in revealing designer outfits whilst never quite managing to get completely naked - the film's violence appears to have been curtailed in post-production for a less restrictive censor rating.
Wu struggles gamely under Chung's ham-fisted direction, playing the role of vengeful loner with his usual quiet dignity (cameraman Ally Wong spends as much time leering over Wu's beauty as Lai, which evens things up a little), while co-star Stephen Fung lurks around the periphery as an obsessed cop determined to uncover Wu's true identity and establish his connection (if any) to the murder of Fung's partner (Sam Lee, in a cameo appearance).
A typical scene has a guy dressed up like Clancy Brown from HIGHLANDER swinging his sword around like a fool while pyrotechnic explosions highlight his two evil minions jumping their motorcycles while the Scorpion-esquire arena rock chugs out the beat.
My favorite part starts with a couple fornicating up in a barn loft: We are treated to ample shots of the amply chested blond riding her amply-bellied lover while weird, dry ice fog and blue lit events disturb the structure.
Graphics (4/5): The graphics, while not as stunning as Bahamut Lagoon's graphics, are still beautifully crafted.
But the weird thing is that the enemies look all tough and terrifying, while your heroes are all chibi and cute looking.
Some tunes sound upbeat while others sound just terrifying.
The script is well crafted, and while you think you know what's happening, the final solution is very unpredictable.
Michael Wilding delights as "Ordinary Smith", and while he started off a tad wooden, Richard Todd was fine too.
This was apparently from Hitchcocks low period between Notorious 1946 and Strangers on a Train in 1951, that Rope has offcourse later become a classic, while Paradine Case and Under Capricorn haven't.
Richard Todd was the man on the run, seen him in a few Disney movies of the 50s so I guess he was the star for a while (He was in a movie with Bette Davis where she played Queen Elizabeth) Michael Wilding played the Police representative, meeting Jane coincidentaly in a bar, or not....
Stage Fright is basically a "whodunit" because you, the viewer, will think you know who the culprit is in this for a while and then realize that maybe you don't, after all.
There's something about Jane Wyman that immediately caught my eye while watching this film.
It might be the only film where Hitch does 2 Cameos - though one is so subtle that it is hard to catch while the other is very obvious.
While that one is more famous, this movie filmed in London with a strong British cast is worth while viewing.
So why, one wonders, does Hitchcock settle for a cheap double-exposure shot of Dietrich in closeup in the foreground while Richard Todd is at the window in the background, when Gregg Toland had already achieved such "deep focus" shots without "trick photography" nine years earlier in "Citizen Kane?"
It also have the misfortune of being released while he was in his prime, so it comes off archaic for the master.
I also thought Stage Fright contained quite a bit more of Hitchcock's dark sense of humor (note the bar and shooting gallery scenes, and Marlene Dietrich's comments while trying on her funeral gown).
Lovely movie, I actually had the luck to be able to see it while i was in school.
A man gets a brain trauma in a car crash and as a result he is amnesiac; a nurse gives him a notebook telling him that while delirious he's said many strange things which came straight from his subconscious self, his black box and she's scribbled his words into this pad so it will help him to recover his memory.
After cutting back to the couple's conversation, director Lester shows us Scott at work in an operating room while Christie, perhaps unbeknownst to Scott, watches him through the door.
Then we come to his two movies with the Beatles - and here I am well aware I am treading on sacred ground for millions of admirers of the lovable mop - tops,but basically they were a rag - bag of gimmicks based around pointing his camera at the boys while they did their schtick.He got lucky and rode on their coat tails ,as did many another lesser - talent.
Magnificently and correctly, of its time, this time capsule of a movie, captures exceedingly well that perturbing flip from 'swinging sixties' to murder and mayhem, and how true the moment when the 'in love' George C Scott skips across a room while the TV plays back images from the ongoing war in Vietnam.
The only weak point in my view (maybe as an European): while the story is very nice, it seems a bit too optimistic and focused on the typical American dream scheme: just believe in yourself and you'll be rewarded.
But he hasn't sold one of the wretched devices in a while and the overdue bills are piling up.
The chase is a long, mean one; but when the end is found, it flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while.
Most people would have given up somewhere along the way with all of the obstacles that befell him while trying to seek a successful career.
I've been as poor as Chris Gardner, and, like him, I've been poor among very rich people in the Bay Area while trying to work my way up.
Chris has to live without a salary for six months while risking just about everything for that long shot gamble.
All this while, he must appear for work in the morning in a suit and tie, and be ready to charm some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the Bay Area.
Will Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an un-paid intern.
i did watch this to the end, while i was watching another movie at the same time on my laptop.
Its hard to belive that Omar Epps was only about 18 while shooting this film & 2pac was only around 20, anyways this movie basically is a different style of african american movies, not showing that everyone in the hood deals with guns, but 2pacs personality had an amazing change in this movie, it was so realistic & his acting is just great.
On the positive side the movie does feature a girl with a great heaving bosom who runs up and down a track for a while in the movie.
Wyatt Earp himself is portrayed as a very powerful individual who, while fighting on the side of the law, could also be cold-hearted, cruel, and excessively violent at times.
Then grown up, he marries sweetheart Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), who soon after died from typhus, while pregnant, and Wyatt burned their house and all possessions inside, turning to a life of crime to survive, forcing him to run away from Missouri to Dodge City.
"Wyatt Earp" led me to pick up a copy of the early Earp bio by Stuart Lake while working in Canada, and I was surprised to find photos of the actual historical people tipped inside.
Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorfulÂ Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherÂ  In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gamblerÂ Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignityÂ Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealistÂ Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisÂ  In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchiefÂ He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best momentsÂ His character has his own form of abilityÂ Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosisÂ Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degreeÂ   Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need ariseÂ The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurysÂ The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralÂ  Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touchÂ While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondÂThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old ageÂ   The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well toldÂ But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualitiesÂfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the wayÂ This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magicÂ  "My Daring Clementine" was a film of touchesÂFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceÂ  Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriageÂ Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...
Honestly guys this movie the Mechanik has to be one of the most boring and pathetic movies i have seen in a while.
Because of this, the movie really hit home and stayed with me for a while.
Seeing this infant is supposed to elicit a horrific gasp from the viewer, but the odds are much better that seeing it will make the viewer press pause so they can laugh at it for a while and maybe take a cell phone pic for their wallpaper.
The other adult characters are essentially movie idiots (Keenan Wynn and Roddy McDowall are particularly offensive -- I hope they were paid well), while the hip, turned-on teens in the film protest the Vietnam war and lecture their elders on sexual freedom and openness.
The showdown redefines the term 'tactical weapons' with bullet-strider Dolph picking an over and under shotgun to irritate the opposition into submission while his rag-tag troupe make every attempt to get themselves shot.
You'll never see a high school again filled with as many thin, beautiful coeds as Mr. Vadim presents in this movie all sporting the shortest of mini skirts that is, while they're still IN their clothes.
But he does do a nice thing for Ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after Ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by Telly Savalas's character, Sam Surcher.
Hudson essentially pimps out substitute teacher Angie Dickenson to his young virginal protÃ©gÃ©, while she makes her own fierce attempts at getting into Hudson's drawers.
But then we have a great action finale with 'The Phantom,' Alf Sykes, his son and Ken all fighting or hanging off the highest cliff while Jenny and her father's men speed to the rescue with Ken's horse 'Tarzan.'
If studios stop making animal movies for a while maybe a fourth Air Bud movie will be refreshing.
Unlike the first two films, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it's in very quick glimpses; every once in a while, these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation.
The film involves a shepherd-cum-experienced mountain-climber (a rather glum Quinn) who's asked by the French resistance (in the figures of Marcel Bozzuffi and Michel Lonsdale) to take a prominent nuclear scientist (James Mason) and his family (including wife Patricia Neal and daughter Kay Lenz) across the Pyrenees to safety in neutral Spain; along the way, they're helped by a group of traveling gypsies (led by Christopher Lee), while McDowell is the maniacal SS officer in pursuit.
However, the film's main source of entertainment is McDowell Â especially via his campy attire as a chef while torturing the captured Lonsdale, his Swastika-imprinted underpants (during the scene in which he rapes Lenz), and even while mimicking the Fuehrer in front of a mirror (parting his hair a' la Hitler, putting the black comb above his lips as a makeshift moustache, and giving himself the Nazi salute).
The stand out scene is the one where he interrogates the Michel Lonsdale resistance man, and chops off his fingers while cooking dinner, we don't see it the camera pans away, but it still is terrifying!
This movie ran in Europe for quite a while in the 1980s.
All the dead woman had to do was change her will while she was alive   Story two ) A bunch of feminist " lesbian " students find the going tough when their college commitee turn against them though for one of them it leads to a happy ending .
It's all about Dolph being on a mission (again) and getting revenge (again) while at it.
She's great in playing sexy, strong or serious women, but her attempt to put on a girlish performance while being in her forties, is just pathetic.
As for the rest, the first installment with Vanessa Redgrave contains more holes than a golf course; while the second with Chloe Sevingy and Michelle Williams feels too hip for its own good and sits uncomfortably with the other two parts.
It takes a little while to get used to the style of animation of the series, and I am not sure that it really works; it looks like it was just cheap to make.
The character design, uncannily accurate voice work and fluid animation are all cracking, and it's fun to see the cartoon's events tie in to 'Episode III', while the majority of the action is spirited and inventive.
Finally, since great characters like Yoda, Grievous and Mace Windu have seldom been better used than by Tartakovsky, we should rejoice that his input in the Star Wars universe is destined to continue for a while.
So I watched these shorts while on my friend's couch in Seattle.
It's been a while since I have seen an action movie of 'this type'.
Perhaps one of Clone Wars' major highlights is the lightsaber duels: they are all beautifully recreated from the movies while being spiced up with the 'Samurai Jack' trademarks that make the original a hit amongst viewers.
The voice acting, while mostly provided by actors from the Star Wars video games (except for Anthony Daniels who reprises his role as Threepio), is pretty well done by any standards.
Too bad it only lasted one season ; I can't understand why while other sitcoms which were in lesser caliber can survive longer.
The script for this film, while hardly original, is pretty good for low budget fare like this.
Cause it's not worth your while.
I've seen the other shows like this, SNL, MadTV, etc, but this was the best while it lasted.
I was hoping for a nice, solid portable Grand Theft Auto ever since I first played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a while back.
But once in a while Sandler will make a real turkey, and "You Don't Mess with the Zohan" is one of the worst.
It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine.
And while rear, the occasional joke is very laughable.
In summary, Zohan is while occasionally funny, 99% of the time a very messy, silly, outrageous (not in a good way) film.
And yes, while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness, there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen.
They went in expecting to see an evolution of Sandler's humor, and while I would say that Zohan raised the bar a tad, it's still Adam Sandler.
Francis made some great British horror classics in the 70's, like "The Creeping Flesh" and "Tales that Witness Madness", while Wiederhorn single-handedly was responsible for the only recommendable 'underwater-Nazi-zombie' flick ever made: the unique "Shock Waves".
He travels to Russia and meets with Burton (Ben Cross) who will supply him with weapon's and assembles a team of mercs to help Nick get back Julia, while at the same time finishing what he did 7 years previously, killing Sasha.
The use of sound is excellent, while the general editing of the film is slick, well paced and never goes overboard.
This thoroughly entertaining movie has two intertwined story lines: a talented Navy doctor (Ken Wahl) trying to save lives while coping with the challenges of working in a war zone, and his involvement with a talented nurse (Cheryl Ladd).
i little boring i guess...  i was reading a book, while watching this one... and i watched just the parts with the gore.
Finally, I think Lara Wendel played her role very well: the fear she felt while being haunted perfectly was reflected in her eyes in many ways.
All the while they are being pursued by mysterious, pale men called 'the whisper people' by Caleb and Abby.
As we know, determinism suggests a higher intelligence controls existence while randomness implicates a meaningless sequence of accidents led to our existence.
Nic Cage lets is son go while he and the rest of the world disintegrates.
The plot, while seemingly interesting, was poorly carried out and what was developed tapered away without being solved.
It seems a lot of the problems people had with the movie had to do with the plot, and while it's not flawless it's still really well told.
It managed to mix the thriller genre while successfully (to a greater or lesser degree) incorporating both the sci-fi and spiritual elements.
Nicholas Cage is better than I have seen him in a while.
SLIGHT SPOILERS NOTHING MAJOR I just saw Knowing and it was one of the worst movies i'd seen in a while.
In the summary of this movie you will hear something like.....Truckstop waitress struggles to raise her two daughters...while this is true, the story is so much more than that.
Kurt Douglass while showing his years here, plays the street wise detective hot on the trail and his acting is still top notch.
You might not remember it afterward, but you might very well have a smile on your face while watching it.
I never thought while watching this film, and the alternate version by Soderbergh, that the daughter never existed.
He follows him and proceeds to knock him down and continues to throw punches at him while asking where his daughter is.
The scene I was really touched by was while Keane was telling Kira how to do better at Skeeball he began to feel what I call "his demons" begin to surface as he turns away from Kira.
When a woman, who lives next to him, starts trusting him and asks him to care for her daughter for a while, the audience just waits for the inevitable tragedy to happen.
Keane does not need to commit any crime; we do that for him in our fearful minds, while watching the movie.
Keane is one of the finest movies I have ever seen and it will stay in my memory for a long while.
Also when he takes care of another child while it's mother is gone for a few days, you start wondering if Keane is not going to hurt or kidnap this child!
When I left the theater, I felt stronger, purged, for a while at least, of the private terrors that always lurk beneath the surface.
Its a shame that so much crap makes it to the big screen, while gems like this one are hard to find.
However, it takes a while before you remember that they are both from the same stock with the same bad ways.I'm sure he didn't have a big budget, regardless the movie seemed to be very professional.
I loathed Disaster Movie, Epic Movie was pretty much the same and while not as bad as the former two Meet the Spartans was pretty poor too.
Sure, everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while, but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma's freeze-dried remains.
And while there is some film history emerging, the film is a great treat.
Michael Pare to me has always been hit or miss so while I quite enjoyed the amusing antics of such stupid (yet fun) movies like Instant Justice and World Gone Wild, I was expecting a level of magical dumbness that would make one gleeful of it's absurdities.
A boy (selfish with every girl on his feet) ruins his brother's wedding, while 3 ghosts try to turn him back in the good guy he used to be...the boy manages to solve things up and to take back the love of his life.End.
I went to see this yesterday and I wish I'd saved my Â£7 and a precious 2 hours of my already valuable time...I'm just glad that I didn't buy any refreshments while I was there too!!
So, I went and while only 20 mins into it, my friends turned to me and said, "This isn't very good is it?"
And it was a nice change from all of the usual movies to see some actors you haven't seen in a while, like Michael Douglas.
This movie is one that is fun to watch kicked back late at night while eating nachos and drinking a beer.
Still, it's a decent enough effort, forgettable but effective while it lasts.
Kevin White (wincott) works for the Drug Enforcement Agency in San Fransisco, while his brother Jack (Gary Hudson) is a tough street-cop in L.A. Kevin is as straight as they come while Jack has become as dirty as the villains he's supposed to be putting away.
Gary Hudson, while not too impressive in the fight scenes (at least where kicking was involved) also impressed me in his role as a man whose greed has led him down a dark path but who, deep in his heart, is still a good person.
Jeff Wincott (from the Miami Vice knockoff "Night Heat")plays an FBI agent trying to track down a Russian drug kingpin while trying to deal with his ailing ex-cop father and crooked LA cop brother.
Ming Ming's especially, is one adopted from flicking explosive projectiles at her enemies, while D's style is quick, brutal, and very short ranged.
It's campy and hilarious, but it's mostly a specific type of humor and while there are some jokes that deviate from this basic strategy, the show is not a conventional sitcom (which relies heavily on one-liners).
O'Brien and Smigel manage to drop in references to nearly every Quinn Martin 70s police drama while at the same time weaving a bitterly hilarious ode to the chew-em-up, spit-em-out world of Hollywood TV actors who go from being essential pop-culture icons to unemployable has-beens in what seems like weeks.
Unlike the second game, where the pedestrians talk with Spidey and comment him while you're swinging around the city, the third game is completely dead in this area.
Feast is the brain child of Project Greenlight--a horror film which attempts to capture the essence of classic horror films while at the same time putting a contemporary and gory spin on things.
The reason Feast fails is because it did neither for me while watching.
After all this time - it's been a while since I saw it - I still get a kick out of it.
Randall Peltzer (the late Hoyt Axton), while going all around town trying to sell his faulty wacky inventions, accidentally stumbles on a cute little Mogwai at an antique china store.
Also.. don't bother trying to eat anything while watching this movie!
I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot.
Also, while Henry Fonda was okay as the two-time loser accused of murder, his character was so unlikable in the last part of the movie that the impact of his being falsely accused of the crime was greatly diminished.
Like any good series, while each stands on its own, you will get more by following Curtis' entire path down the rabbit hole starting with "Pandora's Box" to "the Mayfair Set" "the Century of the Self" and "The Power of Nightmares" (research to collect the names shows more, but I have not managed to find them).
The spoiler if there could be one is that while a dichotomy grew up as a discussion about "Positive vs Negative Freedom" the discussion was one sided and delusional, and in the end based on the mathematics of the brilliant but paranoid schizophrenic John Nash, whose beautiful arithmetic had only one flaw, it only worked if everyone was at least as much a brilliant paranoid schizophrenic as he was.
This family sits down and eats dinner while they know aliens are outside, no one panics, the little girl is a lot older in the video and is too active and talkative.
While it is occasionally not very believable, it sure DID give me a shiver every once in a while.
The Alien on the roof, the girl asking for water and having a supernatural connection to the aliens, the whole theme of being locked in your own home, on some farm near a lake while aliens invade your home.
I got up to crack two beers open while it was playing and didn't fee the need to pause the disk.
Kirk is eating a snack while on the bridge conducting a search, or when Uhuru is trying to make small-talk with Mr. Spock while he's at the helm.
Overall, this episode shows that future life, while with obvious differences in technology, will be largely the same for us humans.
The only other reviewer at the time of my posting states that the quality of his VHS transfer was excellent, while my 'remastered' DVD print is about as second rate as they come.
The fee for an escort back then - ten dollars plus expenses while on the date!!!
While this film is not as sleazy as SLAVES IN BONDAGE or GAMBLING WITH SOULS, two earlier films that featured star Wheeler Oakman as a pimp, ESCORT GIRL is slickly made and well-acted by a wonderful cast, and while it doesn't "show anything", it does have a seedy, dirty feel to it, even though it's not unlike a studio-bound, low-budget Grand National crime drama.
In this film from actor-directors Alex Harz and Tom Kennedy, while it also features a central character with an anger management problem (West, played by Kennedy), the charmed circle is extended to include a companion: Arthur (Harz), an amiable 'retard', as well as in turn his inanimate, if beloved companion, the inflatable sex doll Nancy.
Citing David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Monty Python, the Coen brothers and fellow Colorado filmmakers Matt Stone and Trey Parker as influences, co-director Herz says the main intention of his film was to provide something unique, all the while evoking emotions.
Never the less Arthur is a watchable, warm creation, one's tempted almost to say endearing, while his peculiar peccadilloes, sexual or otherwise, ultimately add to rather than detract from our sense of his humanity.
The story progresses with these elements flaming into a feverish pitch until reaching a climatic ending, while the whole time holding on to its roots of truly twisted humor.
His sidekick(s), Art, played by Alex Harz, brings some comical Rain Man or even Sling Blade behavior into the mix, while the blowup doll, Nancy, takes on the weird role of Dr. Ruth combined with Jonbenet Ramsey and the good old wholesome girl next door.
), which supposedly challenges political correctness and taboo sensitivities, while exposing the dark underbelly of our society.
I really can't remember the last time I laughed so hard while watching a film!
I felt, really felt emotion while watching this film!
pulls all the punches, and it's material, while uncompromising, is brilliant.
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
are able to tell you the depressing truth while making you laugh so hard you can hardly breathe.
I loved all the subtleties and symbolism, while the main characters, Art, West & Nancy make for quite a fascinating dynamic trio.
they claim to love the shells around them while holding fast to their own.
The pain, the disillusionment of being an outcast or mentally disabled, while lost in a cruel vortex of reality.
Hilarious, off-the-wall, while oddly majestic.
And the 3 main characters of the film, West the psychopath, Art the retarded & Nancy the Lovedoll, develop so well as the film progresses, while engaging in some of the most captivating dialog / interaction of any movie I have ever seen.
I STILL have one every once in a while!
However, this is not the case and die-hard Bronson fans get to enjoy this little gem while the rest of the world misses out because they were too busy shunning the unfairly typecast Bronson.
This movie, among several others, kept me sane while attempting to cope with my divorce several years ago.
I have to admit that I haven't seen this film in a while, but I loved it as a teenager.
A stage magician, the ever-loathsome Jack Cassidy, sneaks away in mid-act while supposedly hidden in a locked box and snuffs his partner and blackmailer, Nehemia Persoff.
The timing is perfect in the rearrangement of the archived footage, which while not too difficult to ad-lib in theory, is difficult to do well... and it is done perfectly here.
Teasers are okay but I think the only time that could/should potentially happen is if they decided to finish off the series....which I hope doesn't happen for quite a while.
face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality.
One night, while ostensibly performing his celebrated trick of being locked in a steel cabinet and dowsed in a tank of water, Santini is really disguising himself as a waiter and walking unseen to Jerome's office.
NCIS had been on TV a while when I got into the series.
I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.
Firstly, the characters are, while somewhat stereotypical in their mold, fully developed and incredibly dynamic.
The autopsy scenes, while grisly, fascinate me because they're quite accurate in their depiction and their protocol.
This is an amazing TV series focusing on the investigation team of NCIS who investigate a number of things including brutal murders, terrorist threats, kidnaps and other things happening inside the navy while developing a close friendship.
She loves to hear techno or hard rock music (like Android Lust) played at a very loud volume while working.
He instead sets up one unlikely premise (Martin suddenly having a gay encounter; Christina lamely seducing a truck driver; Julia going off her nut, et al) that serves no real pay off and loses interest in Tonya's plight (it is apparent that she lost one child, while her surviving off- spring are so disparate they may as well be strangers), which should have been the central focus.
the most underrated show on tv, and while th andy richter show looks really good, i hope it doesn't replace the best attempt at a new show since malcolm in the middle (fox works wonders by going against convention...look at it, simpsons is a cartoon, 70's show is a period piece, malcolm introduced a new style, undeclared is breaking new ground, grounded for life is flashbacked, titus is hardcore...man i love fox)watch it, you won't be disappointed
The series is fast-paced going quickly from one funny little scene to another all the while showing us the quirkiness of these University of North Eastern California students.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
But in the end Flor marries her prince and they live happily ever after while the villains end up in jail.
At one point a man pins her against a brick wall at night, puts a pistol to her head and drops the hammer on an empty chamber while warning her to back off.
Julie Walters ("Educating Rita") looks as stalwart as she acts, and does a good job conveying her panic while waiting to be interrogated by the IRA leaders.
With "looking for Fidel" Oliver tries to fix that, he's interviewed several Cuban dissidents, their families, and has asked Castro about the last executions in the isle and stuff...  Now, here comes the big question: why are the USA so obsessed with Castro while they form alliances with dictatorships that are much more harmful than Cuba's such as Morocco, Arabia Saudi, China, etc.?
All in all, the acting was reasonably good (except for the scenery chewing villains) and the costumes were great, but I had a hard time staying awake while watching this film.
However, some scenes take it too far, and even I couldn't sit through it without wincing, and I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of people have threwn up while watching it.
Jonathan Schaech proves his diversity as an actor, while Rose McGowen sticks with her usual "bitch" character as she has done in many other movies.
I'm not crude enough to list all the similarities in this review but let me just say that while there may not be anywhere near enough to call it plagiarism there sure is more than enough to call it a coincidence.
spoiler alert:  this movie was so bad, that i did not feel sorry for the protagonist when he was anally raped while having his penis cut off with pruning shears by a band of shirtless neo-nazis while his girlfriend and best friend were wrapped in plastic and beaten.
He was a great student and loved to solve mysteries even while in school.
It didn't take prisoners, and while its a bit dated it still has the power to terrify the audience.
In the meanwhile, a young woman, her boyfriend and two hicks (one of which - a girl - is going to A) get raped by vines and B) choke to death on an eyeball, while her boyfriend is going to leak some massive blood) have arrived in the cabin too, and as it turns out the whole blame of the situation stands on the parents of the young woman, herself, and her boyfriend, because it's them who looked for, found and tried to translate the Necromicon (yes, THAT book) in the first place...  Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.
Unfortunately it was being used by professor Knowby while he translated "The Book of the Dead" and when Ash plays the recording evil spirits are summoned.
Now what if Swayze's hand had become possessed and he was trying to deal with that while doing the Tango or something.

You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.
Can you guess it, it's when Ash "saws" off his own hand with a psycho laugh, while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming.
One needs a break once in a while!
Besides the two stunning leads, the film offers the most glorious vision of a bygone era seen on the screen in quite a while.
In fact, as how most historical epics would go, such as the likes of Alexander or peer Bollywood film Asoka (starring Shah Rukh Khan), while efforts are placed into extensive research to try and stay as authentic as possible, there still are various interpretations to characters, some of whom will be taken to task (like Oliver Stone's vision of Colin Farrell as Alexander the Great) by audiences.
And to leaders out there, there's a scene which while it's something that's not new, is always apt to remind them not to sit on their ivory towers, but to walk the ground and hear the grumbling first hand, as nothing beats ground level intelligence.
Also the director's vision was to show the Mughal Emperor as a sensitive soul and that is what Hrithik evocatively brings about either in the vulnerability he portrays, while apologising to Maham Anga, or the passion tinged with restraint he exhibits when dealing with his distant wife.
Ashutosh Gowariker's "Jodhaa Akbar" is the most ambitious film to emerge from Bollywood's stables in quite a while.
A young Akbar, sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don't join him, are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that's when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have, misunderstood him.
The first half-an-hour had some war sequences which were shot wonderfully but got kind of stretching-too-long after a while.
Rowe and Cox (and the script, of course) made younger versions of two of the most iconic characters in all of literature credible as teenagers while still more or less staying true to the spirit of the characters in Holmes canon.
So, while I'm impressed with the supporting cast and the money spent shooting in exotic locations around the world, Jaguar Lives!
Portraying Sherlock (Nicholas Rowe) and Watson (Alan Cox) meeting in a boarding school while some strange murders are occurring in London, they do pretty much anything that they want.
At the end of the movie Holmes is leaving Brompton School while Watson will graduate and go on to medical studies.
The main actors in the film were unknowns, who remained unknowns, while those behind the scenes became household names.
This film, while it does take great liberties with Doyle's writings, is highly entertaining.
For much of its length, it is a much quieter, slower-paced drama, resting almost entirely on meaty, complex performances from two actors, one of whom--Fanning--was only 10 years old while making the film!
All the while, however, the story is very thin: that of a father and his young daughter coping with the gruesome death of the wife/mother who supposedly slit her wrists in the bathtub where she bled to death.
I am blessed that I had reading material to entertain me while using this movie for background noise.The most redeeming aspect of this film is the skilled use of the "chicken cutlets".
This movie while of course jazz inspired and musical, was a deeper reflection into the cracks and fissures that shaped a life.
#3- The "Good morning Heartache" scene at her birthday party at the club #4-The scene where she attacks Billy Dee in the bathroom, because he won't give her her dope #5- When Piano man is beaten to death #6-When she gets the call that her mother died,while she was in the middle of getting a fix..I COULD go on.
Diana Ross did not channel Billie Holliday the way that Angela Bassett did with Tina Turner or the way Val Kilmer did with Jim Morrison or how Jamie Foxx did with Ray Charles but she internalized Billie's triumphs, pain, struggles, and personal demons and depicted this exceptionally well and she interpreted Billie's voice by not trying to duplicate the inimitatable but maximized the range of her own voice using Billie's distinctive phrasing and capturing the essence of her spirit while coaxing out a myriad of emotions.
After this film, in addition to Billie, I listened to Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nat King Cole, Ethel Waters, and Dinah Washington while my peers were just starting to rock to disco.
And I think that's what the director wanted to clear up right from the very first scene, with a flash forward to Billie Holiday's drug bust while the credits were still on.
It felt like there was scene after scene of her being drug-addled, whining, and screaming, which began to abrade after a while.
The voice, while not really like Billie Holiday, just glows.
The film would have you believe that Billie started shooting heroin because she witnessed a lynching; one of the dramatic highpoints depicts Billie on the tour bus reflecting on the horrors of lynching while we hear snatches of her most famous song, Strange Fruit.
She does considerable damage in the film - and it is a weakness (I'd call it a serious weakness) that she never really suffers the consequences about it while others do suffer.
Not that the idle rich in the Depression years had it so good, of course, as they apparently had to cut back on the caviar before dinner at least once in a while.
We purchased this movie at a drugstore while on vacation because I remembered watching it a loving it when I was younger.
To save face, Powell agrees to marry Harding, at least for a while.
On the honeymoon, Powell suggests a divorce, while Harding coolly recommends they wait six months so as not to seem too obvious.
I never cry while seeing a movie especially if someone is around.
i think Magnifico is really great.I cried while watching the movie.One of the best Filipino movies I've ever seen.
Menzel is one of those great Czech New Wave directors (along Milos Forman, who managed to get into the spotlight by moving to the USA) who established this very special Czech style of movie-making: sensitive while humorous, joyful while tragic, with very intimate and thought-provoking stories.
The script writer, actress Emma Thompson, uses language in a manner designed to communicate rather than to just make a bunch of noise while pretending to say something while saying nothing.
The best thing about this film is that while it will appeal to children, it doesn't dumb down or indulge in cavity-inducing sweetness that you tend to see in films produced by Hollywood.
His wife was upset due to all the flings he had been through while married to her.
He called for the "Seconds" to take the actors' places while they fine tuned the lighting.
Here the message seems to be political while in Hollywood it's often rather religious, but the technique is the same, and strangely, you can hardly miss the Devil and God working around a hapless Man even here.
Gabin is more engaged by the material than usual at this stage in his career and Delon is surprisingly good, especially in his all too convincing final scene, while a young Gerard Depardieu turns up in a couple of scenes offering three generations of iconic Gallic cinematic losers in one film.
To be honest, even if I am usually more toward "good" movies, I very much enjoy a good comedy once in a while.
An old grandfather, Don Plutarco plays the violin and his son plays the guitar, while the child grandson collects some pennies in a rural poor town.
However the film opens with some violent scenes, the rest of the movie saves this by showing the struggle of don Plutarco to aide his family, while the Mexican army occupies the nearby hills in a mean way.
To people used to graphic and loud drama, this film perhaps will not be easy to appreciate while watching it.
Only "The violin" is shot in black and white while Ken Loach shot his film in lush color.
And while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act.
I should mention that while there is no Lindsay Lohan nudity per se, there are some extremely raunchy scenes involving close shots of various body parts of Dakota's while she is wearing next to nothing and writhing around a stripper dance pole.
Although it is a good film the acting is standard and decent while the dialoque is sort of wooden and flat it does feel real and almost accurate.
Of course there was plenty of bad acting and definitely scenes that had no sense in them at all, but I am a sucker for a very SMALL amount of bad movies, and while this movie is kind of bad, I liked it.
Lindsay Lohan makes her characters somewhat... likable even, and while the plot isn't the best, it is decent.
And she is suffering from this conditioned called "twin stigmata", kinda like the twins on GI Joe (You know, you have to hit one to hurt the other type of thing), which is how I know how to write my only crappy story about her cause deep down inside I know she exists, and that is also the reason that she is randomly losing limbs while she is poll dancing in a strip club where she in the only one who doesn't take off her clothes (of course flashing her hooha to all the paparazzi is totally acceptable, but parish the thought that she flash a teet and get paid for it) is because that when you cut them off my body it falls off of hers.
Oh, and by the way, two weeks after you have abducted me, she is found in a ditch, missing the same limbs that you cut off of me cause of the whole twin stigmata thing, and within a 24-48 hour period, she recovers, is interrogate by the FBI, is outfitted with a fully articulate artificial hand and leg (almost the same type of hand that Ash got in Army of Darkness, imagine that), has insanely wild sex with my boyfriend while my mom scrubs the sink downstairs...  *breathe*  "...And then once she puts it all together that my father, who really isn't my father, bought (as in purchased) me at the hospital from my crack whore birth mother, she confronts him and says the key line "I know who killed me", and comes to find you.
The real Aubrey was kidnapped by a serial killer (who turns out to be her piano instructor Douglas) and while he's torturing her, in another town Dakota is having the same exact things happen to her unexplainably (turns out to be they're stigmatic twins).
"I Know Who Killed Me" is about a young college student named Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan), who disappears one night while going out with some friends.
Aubrey's worried parents try and uncover the truth, while Dakota tries to convince others that she isn't Aubrey... but is Aubrey really just pretending to be someone else?
Color (mainly the color blue) plays a vast amount of significance in the story, and while it is there for a purpose, it almost seems too obvious because the color pops up continuously in practically every scene.
One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I'm not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it's favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.
Her previous films mainly consist of pointless teeny-bopper trash, so I respect her for doing something with a little more depth, and while her acting and delivery is a bit flat on occasion, she carries this movie well.
The showdown between Lindsay and the killer, while a bit contrived, was pretty scary, as was the villain.
Cinematography was excellent, the storyline (while a little problematic at times) was original and very intriguing, there are some pretty creepy scenes, and the big plot twist was different from the norm.
She had a daughter while living in the dumpster.
Despite the punches in the stomach you get while watching it, it's in fact an uplifting movie, in that you see the love inside her family, the blissful ignorance of her friends at the dumpster, the fact that she laughs at herself and wants to go on living to fulfill her "mission".
I should have guessed when the cashier gave me a funny look while getting my ticket.
Camilla personally takes on the job to find a young, sweet, naive virgin while she and Charles can see each other without her suspecting much.
And in fact I remember gathering around a portable TV to watch the wedding of Charles and Diana with my family while we where camping.
I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective.
a guy that spends his whole high school year trying to get back together with his summer love while doing annoying things along the way.
The songs are great, the dancing is great, the humour is great and you'd think that without a plot the movie could be impossible to watch, but no; you are so entertained while watching Grease that you wouldn't care if someone's child dies in the middle of the film.
To be fair, most Indians don't understand American culture, and fear it even while it is embraced in cities like Bombay.
Subhash Ghai always shows NRIs in bad light and Indians as too good  His carricatured NRIs in PARDES, TAAL are e.g.s of those  The film is just that,   The NRIs are shown as bad, while our Indians are shown as pure Ganga type  The film is typical, there are some good situations but the story isn't different nor is the treatment In fact surprisingly SRK played the role of getting a girl for someone else a lot in 1997, be it KOYLA, PARDES   Direction by Subhash Ghai is ordinary Music is good  In this film SRK is a pleasure, here he doesn't ham thankfully as he always does Here he is well directed and gives a restrained performance Mahima is decent, she looks gorgeous but sadly her career didn't' go ahead Apoorva is too awkward Amongst rest Amrish Puri excels as usual Alok Nath is stereotypical rest are okay
The movie is bittersweet in that it shows the drive the mother infuses into young Judy Garland, the special relationship between Judy and her father, and the unbelievable talent inside this child, all the while reminding us that each of these facets took a toll on Judy Garland and eventually shaped her life both in positive ways and in ways that were painful.
But then one of her heels broke while she and her competitors were warming up.
Then, on the last visit, he ask's her "Can you buy us a cat while we are away and feed that?
Next thing ya know, lover boy has an attack of fish-hooks-erupting-through-the-skinitis and the ol' lady starts going off her nut and they see 'er stickin' 'erself in the leg and then she just sort of goes into the background for a li'l while.
The two films have other similarities, despite both being based on different sources (this film has the more notable pedigree, taken from a George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart play, while MR. BLANDINGS is based on a novel).
They enter the bathroom and slowly rummage around in it while Benny stands there gaping, his cheeks covered with shaving cream.
Silence while the audience cracks up.
There are a few bad lines but Benny's dead pan expression while saying them actually make them amusing.
But here it's the wife (Ann Sheridan), while husband Jack Benny gets increasingly irritated with the amount of money he's having to shell out.
Sheridan has a passion for antiques and while on a shopping trip for same in Pennsylvania comes across an old colonial house that's definitely seen better days.
So much of the humor comes about by the many problems they have while trying to upgrade the property.
The two fall in love, but Paul, intent on establishing a Dutch Free State back home, has no time to settle down and refuses to marry her while he has this commitment...   Several years pass and Katie has wed Shawn Kildare (John Justin).
Actors will suddenly sit down on the floor in the middle of a scene while talking for no reason.
The second episode demonstrates that, while red ink won't be overflowing the bathtubs, the series will be capable of creepy and mysterious scripts that'll definitely have little tykes freaked and cartoon-buff adults glued.
had much the same theme, searching for gold, while spreading "God's word", and Aguirre is a far better film.
Set design, costumes, score and script deliver, and while momentum is at times a distinct challenge, if you're not fully engaged in the dialogue, the result is likely to be languid in pace and voluble in speak.
Robert Shaw plays a convincing Pizarro -daring, ambitious and greedy- who after a while shows some kind of respect and even admiration towards a man he can't quite understand.
It really takes a while for She-Ra to emerge using the sword.
The best sequence for me was the one where He-man is captured by the evil Horde while Adora can't sleep and wakes up in the middle of the night.
Of course, while there's no concrete, verifiable record of Arthur or the other characters in this film, that doesn't matter; director John Boorman has created a movie that is magnificent in its scope, and vividly tells the Arthurian legend in entertaining style.
I wondered while I was watching it if either of them ever regretted being in such a bad movie.
The film creates a world in which these events really happen, there's no jarring pull back to reality while watching it.
The most moving part for me is still the climatic finale, in which, after the death of Arthur, and the world seems to have ended, Excalibur is brought back to the Lake and Three mysterious queens take Arthur away on a barge, all this while the dramatic music to Wagner's Siegfried's Funeral March blares triumphantly.
It took quite a while for me to realize she had mental problem.
Danika insists on not having a maid to help her, and while having a daydream driving her car with her children, she does not pay attention in the traffic light and is hit by a school bus, killing her children, but surviving.
Regina Hall was good and the film earned a 2 because of that, and because Marisa Tomei made an obvious effort to interact with Hall in several critical scenes, keeping her 'angst' low-key while Hall's character got a chance to shine.
The hallucinations within the scene one fantasy are perhaps the weakest part of the film, they are used as tool to keep a viewer interested long enough to see the film through and while the provide clues that nothing else that is happening is real or at least that there is some level of menatl issue.
Obviously, it ends up getting tedious after a a while.
It started with the climax of a volcano having an outburst, and having to go save friends until one was swept away in a storm while it was raining...the climax was broken, and then you met the two villains in the game; they noticed you eavesdropping and then they knock you out.
It takes a while to understand them and how they work, but once you figure them out, the possibilities are practically limitless.
The characters of both convey genuine emotions and actions, while copious close ups enhance the stories' intimate natures.
I particularly was touched by Yossi's nuanced statement of his relationship with Jagger to Jagger's family and the rest of his platoon by being able to answer the mother's questions of Jagger's personal favorites, and how certain characters were oblivious while others knew what was going on.
I saw their eyes in the room...wet... some of them showing their emotions discretely while Yossi and Lior, in a simple way, was sharing their souls in the snow... as I never saw it in a gay movie before.
Yossi (Ohad Knoller) is a brooding commander who feels constrained by his role as a macho authority figure to conceal his sexuality from the conscripts under his command, while Jagger (Yehuda Levi, a popular Israeli heartthrob whose career was kickstarted by an appearance in the TV soap opera "Cheers for Love" in 2001) is one of his subordinates, a carefree guy who wants them to declare their love publicly by retiring from the Army and setting up house together.
Yes, Wallace Beery breaks Lily's heart (and ours) with his drunk scene played for laughs, but O'Neill knows whereof he's writing, and gives us a depth and subtext to these scenes which most comedies of the period or later "comedy drunk scenes" couldn't imagine, and lets us understand the deeper meaning even while we permit ourselves to smile at Beery & O'Neill's craft.
In smaller roles, Cecilia Parker is all innocence as Linden's sweetheart, while crusty old Charley Grapewin almost spits vinegar as her cantankerous father.
I skipped forward, dropping in once in a while if anything looked remotely interesting.
A fascinating thing about the film is that while the story is fictional it somewhat holds true to Gloria Swanson, even at one point viewing a film of hers that ruined her career!
But it's also a disfigured love story, which while it keeps it from becoming simply a waxworks or a freak show, causes it to drag a little tiny bit.
Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.
Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together.
Down on his luck, three months behind on his rent, and with his car about to be repossessed, Joe accidentally stumbles upon Norma's faded mansion while trying to escape the police.
Max completely does away with his self-respect, Joe hates himself for his unwillingness to commit to a career or love, and seems to sell himself out for money and clothes almost immediately, and Betty despises herself for falling in love with Joe while she's engaged to another.
The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic.
Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while.
She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while.
Gloria Swanson as the insane Norma Desmond, a mad silent movie star languishing in her old mansion surrounded by reminders of her glory days, and William Holden as a bitingly cynical screenwriter playing gigolo to Swanson while carrying on an affair with nice reader Nancy Olson is great.
In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): "...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces", I'd like to also add that they "didn't need movies; they had films."
I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.
Her tough, no nonsense approach to the character, while making her somewhat vulnerable, was very impressive and it's only in the third season that she lost her touch.
Although the critics may have been wishy-washy when reviewing this film, I had only one word going through my mind while watching it: brilliant.
Since I would have otherwise just played on the Internet, I enjoyed myself while watching this.
Charlie is a mess, meets a psychologist who introduces him to group therapy (where Charlie idiotically relates all the DEA secrets openly) and to gastroenterology where nurse Judy (Sandra Bullock) administers a barium enema then other more herbal-sided treatments while she and Charlie become bonded.
Anna Biller,in addition to acting as the film's central female lead,Barbi,also wore several hats in the production of this campy period piece (she wrote,directed & edited the film,in addition to set design & even supervising a brief animation sequence,where Barbi is experiencing her first real orgasm, while on some kind of psychedelic drug).The plot concerns a young,suburban housewife who's loutish husband ignores,and eventually abandons her,only to leave her to experimenting with her new found sexual self,including swingers,hippies,etc.
And all the while, the deliciously arch Jared Sanford does his best to act dozens of naked people off the screen.
The characters the actors were portraying often came off as mindless automatons, sort of stereotypical parodies of American archetypes if you will, the performances were often wooden to the point of disbelief Â almost as if they were trying to overact in a very detached manner, it worked quite well and added to the overall sense of "disbelief" I had while watching this film.
Suddenly Big Show returns & while Mysterio is on a stretcher, Big Show grabs the stretcher & slams it against the ring post with Mysterio still on it adding more injury to Mysterio.
His character is a genius who is out of control, but Conti's talent depicts his situation as comic and tragic at the same time-no small feat-- while being absolutely sympathetic.
I weep while I force my self to watch it to the end.
They also skipped really quickly over important scenes and yet took ten minutes on the Samwise the Strong scene which, while important should not take up quite that much time, especially since they had to cut the book down so much to fit it into a movie.
I have to say that while the picture was good, the 1959 remake with Lana Turner was far better.
(spoiler) Bea basically steals Delilah's pancake recipe, uses her image to sell pancakes, and makes a load of moolah, while Delilah, like a good slave, doesn't mind and turns down a cut when offered.
It is the job of the DP/Cinematographer to make the scenes visually interesting while capturing what the Director wants from the actors.
Both films maintain the same basic time-spanning storyline of two widows - one is a white woman who finds professional success but at a price that causes an unintended estrangement from her daughter, while the other is a black woman whose light-skinned daughter causes nothing but grief for all concerned.
Now if Delilah was beaten and raped on a regular basis and still wanted to please her white employer while denying her race the previous poster would have had a point.
Warren William plays Steve Archer, the man who falls in love with Bea while not suspecting the effect he causes in young Jessie, Bea's daughter.
is second rate sitcom: Middle-aged man is caught trying on dresses while visiting his daughter's new in-laws.
makes fun of Shakesperean dramas and other similar costume epics; while simultaneously paying homage to one of Woody's screen idols, Bob Hope.
As a matter of fact, while watching this movie I was wondering if the movie wouldn't actually had been an even better one if each segment was being directed by a totally different director, each with their own personal style and approach.
Cross dresser Lou Jacobi getting caught in a women's dress while visiting a friend's house is another classic as well as 'What's My Perversion' a very brilliant and inspired send up of 'What's My Line'.
"Transvestitism" has Lou Jacobi trying on the dress of a woman at whose house he is a dinner guest, while Jacobi's wife and the hostess' family sit in the living room below, wondering what's taking him so long to go to the bathroom.
Indeed, what other movie features a rabbi being lightly flogged and scolded while his wife sits by his feet and eats pork?
The film is entirely about sexual perversions, even though it is not technically eroticÂ Allen has taken some of the most popular clinical treatments of sexual fetishes and has placed them into very unusual situationsÂ   Gene Wilder, for example, falls in love with a sheep; Woody Allen plays a medieval court jester who gets his lance stuck in his lady's chastity belt while the king is off fighting in the Crusades; a giant breast is released upon the countryside; an Italian couple can only find happiness in public sex; and we are taken into the inner labors of a male human body as it tries to seduce a woman in a carÂ  Each individual scene is quite well doneÂ The tales are rapid filled with irony about the overly exaggerated importance of sex in our cultureÂ
And Ill tell you right now, this movie didn't disappoint me; a small piece of my soul died while watching Dead Above Ground.
For some reason, it cuts to a party scene at the professors house and Jeffery says something ridiculous, pushes a girl into the pool, then David fights with him for a while, i had a hernia, and then Jeffery drives off in a fury, David follows him, and Jeffery ends up dying.
Apparently i missed something boring, and I had juice for a while.
Much props to the director for leaving me with two of the greatest scenes i've seen for a while.
The original, while having some very funny moments was more of a tearjerker and a genuine one it was too.
Sometimes there is silence in the forest, and a character standing still while the light falls just so, to convey wonder or loneliness.
"Bambi II" will surely please most fans of the original, but while it's an honest attempt to make a respectful and original addition to the main storyline, it becomes a bit too clichÃ©d for moments.
The use of a couple of pop ballads may prove damaging on the long road, as while the songs are really good, they take away that atemporal characteristic the first film had and will definitely make the movie outdated a lot sooner than expected.
The difference is that in the original the artwork is more refined, while this one combines the fabulous artwork of the original with computer/digital techniques and technologies.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
So I got to see Bambi 2, while normally we have a million Disney sequels that are major disappointments, but Bambi 2 surprised me, it was very well done and was nicely put together.
And while Bambi's character has always been humanized (as are all animals in Disney movies) he seems far more "human" and much less "animal" than he did in the original.
On "Newhart," Joanna's role was as a pillar of strength for Innkeeper Dick to hang onto when everything was going crazy, while Emily and Dr. Bob took turns skewering each other and their friends and situations with devilish 70s glee.
He knows how to tell a story and his facial expressions while similar always is worth watching.
I'll relate the film to mine: While it's true that Southeast Asian film is just now dealing with the issue of homosexuality; and while it's true that Thai cinema is just emerging and probably needs encouragement - this film is a discombobulated mess.
Then suddenly one night, after a particularly tender moment between the two lovers, Tong walks away into the darkness of an open road, while Keng returns to his post in the jungle.
This movie, while definitely not credible film making by any means(or worth ten stars), is good ol' fashioned, camp entertainment.
And, this being a big budget Japanese release, the picture looks great while the movie is totally goofy.
The action, when it happens, isn't bad, and it would seem that the only thing John Cena CAN do (because he certainly can't act) is beat the crap out of people while grunting and growling like a caveman.
Or when the main villain was trying to get his cable upgraded with a sports package while trying to hide from the cops was just unnecessary.
and they walk through a forest, while cena gets whacked in the head with a fire extinguisher and a plank of wood for the only laugh factors of the film.
This has none: villains kidnap Cena's wife, Cena smashes everything including passing through a couple of houses while hanging on a truck, Cena rescues his loved one.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.
The bad reviews and accusations of cheesiness put me off watching this one for a little while, but I watched it last night and had a blast.
The film is steeped in clichÃ©, hampered by a witless score, and the acting from the three mentioned leads is often embarrassingly bad, notably in the case of Bridges, which might be attributed to the hackneyed script if it were not that Anne Helm as the doxy and Murray Hamilton as Stagg's partner manage to make something of their material, while Broderick Crawford rises above his during his few scenes.
It will stay with you for quite a while.
'Divine Intervention' tries hard, and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles, but the film amounts to little more than a handful of (admittedly lovely) visual jokes thrown onto celluloid, while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses.
I was very concerned about this film, it was scheduled to play at a Jewish Film Festival, and was reported to be very hostile to Israel, while using clever humor and irony.
It is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the Palestinian side, while displaying the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side.
What's the hapless Chinese explorer to do while she writhes in pain?
This is the worst film that I 've seen in a while.
The dialog isn't believable and it doesn't appear that there's one actor who isn't reading directly from a transcript while on screen.
Laughed so hard, one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.
There is a dead moose head on the wall, and when they are watching tv it looks down with its eyes for a while!
Yes, while the film is an exact copy off of the 1981 film 'Stripes' with Bill Murray, Ivan Reitman and John Candy, just nowhere near as good, it has some funny moments.
Can you imagine if the flying turtle dropped a speeding turtle turd on you while you were in your row boat?
Recently I saw Anna May Wong in PICCADILLY, a stylish silent melodrama made in England in 1929, and while the film had its flaws I felt that it was quite interesting and unusual over all, and that its leading lady was fascinating.
Unfortunately, while PICCADILLY exhibited the best technical qualities of the late silent era, including first-rate cinematography, fluid camera movement, and smooth editing, this film exhibits some of the weakest traits of early talkies: the dialog is awkward, the editing rhythm is lethargic, and the acting (with a couple of exceptions) is theatrical in the worst sense of the word.
Well this movie is exactly the opposite... once in a while, you get a movie like THIS.
The bulk of the movie was quite good until suddenly the last 5 minutes of the film was so terribly awful that I was left with total disbelief and my jaw had dropped while I was thinking to myself "No... that cant be the ending... they cant have finished it like that".
Luckily Dario Argento's segment while not without it's flaws (such as a story thats WAY strecthed out), can't help but seem better.
Marshall); and while he is in a vegetated state, she cashes in some of his major assets.
Slow agonizing demise from Zyklon B was the easy part; twenty minutes of choking, while clawing at your throat and eyes and it was over.
The film trivializes the deaths of 6 million, while letting everyone else breath a little easier for not having to face, even at the big screen's remove, the completely dehumanizing horror that was Hitler's death machine.
Quatermain (Chamberlain) and his sexy sidekick Jessie (Stone) set off in search of the former's long-lost brother, who vanished while trying to locate a mythical lost city of gold deep in the Amazon.
Chamberlain is as uncharismatic as ever, while Stone hams up her performance in ever way possibly.
Well, it was, and while I appreciate the nostalgic feel to the film, and the fact that is a slasher film through and through and knows its origins, the film, for me, was a huge let down for ONE reason alone: the character that we are suppose to sympathize with the most and who is by all accounts the main character of the film (Alan) has to be one of the most annoying characters in film history.
A female counselor gets her head and face twisted in barbwire while attempting to flee in a jeep.
Though the movie is set in the real Ireland and not some fairytale facsimile thereof, writer and star Barry McEvoy is still guilty of spinning a totally fatuous yarn that strains a bit too hard for whimsy while at the same time never managing to find the right tone; set in Belfast "sometime during the 1980s," the movie revolves around two friends and barbers at an asylum, one Catholic and the other Protestant, who get the rights to the only hairpiece company in Northern Ireland, and thereby hangs our tale.
If they had decided to make a movie revolving around a murder in a park that would have been fine , ditto if they had decided to make a movie revolving around the London soul scene but seeing as they've tried to combine the two YOUNG SOUL REBELS is a failure while the scenes of homosexuality is totally alienating for the average cinema goer .
After a while, he realized how annoying it is to have someone obsessing over you.
I thought that Kid trying to challenge authority to attempt to find himself was the underlying meaning of the original, while in this one it is Kid repressing his true self in hopes to make his dead father happy.
in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American, while in the other the directors seem to be building age-old stereotypes), the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral, those annoying, randomly placed racist police officers were back, and the dominating "father" element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film.
Strange thing, too, because while I was watching this I couldn't find a single positive redeeming quality to raise my opinion of it - even the locations are not photographed very attractively.
From awkward glances at each other while waiting in line for movie tickets with their respective dates to a "nervewrecking" scene of Dave struggling to call Rafi after looking her up in the phone book.)
Younger seems to focus too much on the topics that come to people easily when thinking about relationships with such a great age difference, such as one person who wants a baby while the other person wants the newest X-Box game, etc..
Now pardon me while I wash the filth from my body.
I can just imagine the "behind the scenes" dialogue while making this picture: "this is going to be such a cute movie, the story is so cute, the dialogue is so cute, the actors are so cute, the acting is so cute, no the acting is so dynamic, it's going to be such a hit with the audience: being so piquant and lovely, and yet so comical........" I don't know too much about the Back Street Boys, except that they're famous, now I realize they must have made some money and thought they were going to make a classic film, they were wrong, money doesn't always translate into good taste.
How many times do we need to be told that Nazis=Bad, while Jews=Good?
Why not the story of a former Jewish mechanic who escaped the forced labor of evil Nazi kitchens where he peeled carrots for 21 hours a day, and who now makes cat food for a living in Guadalajara while moonlighting as a house painter?
Between his line (while having doggy style sex with his nurse...) "less like a schnauzer more like a wolf" and his line to the OTHER boy who thinks he's a dog (what are the chances of this?)
A film of this sort requires interesting, if often two-dimensional supporting characters, and while Lauren Cohen, the female lead, does a creditable job, the rest of the supporting acting is rather bad.
I have been privileged to watch 'Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj' while it is still a relatively unknown despite the enormous success of its predecessor.
Unfortunately, it has been a while since it was shown in national television, but everybody my age (22) know it and love it.
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
You can't even make fun of it while watching it (it's that bad).
A group of bad ninjas just happen to be attempting to take over the park for a ransom while they are there.
In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents.
or "That's coming out of your allowance" while smiling at the camera on cue.
This film is basically ninjas (rubbish ninjas) getting beaten up by little kids for ages, while rubbish bad guys go about executing their rubbish plans.
okay this is a very funny show i remember when i first saw it i could not stop laughing but i after a while i had hear all the jokes and it was starting to get lame.
Did any of the actors put any thought while reading the script.
It never even threatens to come to life once throughout its seven minute runtime and, while it doesn't quite plumb the depths of the studio's very worst output, 'Hurdy-Gurdy Hare' is a cartoon that I could easily live without ever seeing again.
No one else was allowed to watch the TV while this was playing on the day it premiered!
When I actually did watch the miniseries on the SciFi Channel, my reaction was of complete disgust - the storyline, while using parts from the actual books, was neither complete nor in order, the characters didn't seem at all like they should be (even including their descriptions in the books), and everything just seemed wrong.
If "Dumbledore" (actually named archmagus in the show) was so powerful, why didn't he just wipe out the attackers while they were at sea?
Actually, there was a curious phenomenon which occurred while watching the boat chase scene.
But after a while it just puts you to sleep.
Basically its just a movie out in some Florida swamp where Hogan and his wrestling buddies put on some amazingly laughable fight scenes while looking for buried treasure.
My brother and I watched the first 15 minutes of this movie and both decided it was boring and we were getting nothing out of the movie, yet we decided to give it a while longer to see if it got any better.
Why not years earlier in her life while she was still vulnerable before she had fully developed her personality & career?
Proulx's writing style, while unique and engaging for athe first hundred pages, quickly becomes cloying and irritating in the last 200.
I also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced: if you left the Langrishe Theatre Group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot, and while Brian Cox is as good as I've ever seen him, that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors - and it did.
In the end, while it sets the bar for Hi-Def TV to come, I felt it got bogged down in all that realism, and eventually stopped being a better-than-first-rate drama and became a first-rate docu-drama with a bit too much over-acting in places and far, far more cast than was well utilised.
I saw this film a while ago when I was on a big Z-grade zombie movie kick.
However, one day, luck might seem to change, as a stroll through the park she meets Dorothy while sitting a park bench, an unusually intriguing one who just happens to move in to her apartment building the next day.
After a while, though, she seems to have become obsessed with young Robin, as she soon starts popping out of everywhere at any time to try and spend time with her, to an alarmingly excessive degree.
In fact, those doophuses could have done a better job and been amusing while doing so.
Although there are some differences in the film (The jet that docks with the 747 in "Strategic Command" is an SR-71 while the jet in "Executive Decision" is an F-117.
while National socialist skinheads often are guilty of misrepresenting skinhead style and fashion, this is a silly exaggeration.
Quite pointless, if you ask me, while stealth moves would've been more appropriate.
No, instead this goes on and on and then we get to see Gould make a confession while a fly is walking around on his face.
I guess you thought it was fun to come back to Europe and do a picture while being here, no?
And while we're at it, let's use every single special effect available in Final Cut Pro Â or was it Avid?
Another problem is that while most of the performances in the feature version are professional, they cannot match the sterling performances in the TV version.
It is as if they lost pages of the script during the production, or they wrote it while they were making it.
It was like she became a police officer for a while.
At least Dorff entertained me for a little while, but please kill everyone else in the damn movie.
I could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the killer get increasingly closer.
After you have seen the internet-site you die of your worst fear in 48 hours, that I did understand, but why do 'infected' people see the little girl over and over again while she herself was killed as an adult?
I am watching the DVD while writing this comment.
I spied, with my one good eye...  Billy Zane: being held at gun-point, while some thong-clad Brian Bosworth clone orders him to remove his pants and then chases him around the dining room table.
I have graciously rated this schlock-fest a '4':  -1 point for the smouldering indie-flicker James LeGros  -1 point for the gay Boss Hogg drug-dealer who we get to see on the crapper  -1 point for Billy Zane's 'House of Style' eyebrows & mostly believeable hairpiece  & -1 point for a Brian Bosworth-clone who spends all his screen time running around in tight, white, nothing-to-the-imagination jeans... while he informs every male character of exactly where he intends to hide the pickle.  
It didn't make sense.... after they do it while she wears his pants, she asks to get her things back from his room.
That character just dies awkwardly after diving into a shallow pond head first while the story was a positive note.
The hand held cameras, while ostensibly adding to the authenticity of the film, were operated so sloppily that viewers experienced discomfort or outright nausea.
And excuse me, buti think Toni Collette should quit while shes ahead........please.........quit........toni?
I was excited to they're going to make a movie about heavy metal violence but I did not enjoy this movie at all, while it was slightly a bit enjoyable, overall I was highly dissapointed in it, I wish that they would focus more on the metal bands than the government.
Norm while having a lunch rendezvous with Scott has the surprised and now ex-blackmailer, with Norm now taking over the job, get the living hell beaten out of him in full view, in Norm needing witnesses to make it look good, of some two dozen customers at a local Japanese restaurant with him being one of the persons who does the beating.
Some were very clear and framed well while others were 'over cranked' and too soft.
Sorbo plays a former U.S. Marine, Nick Prescott, who trains horses for living, while the Rock played Chris Vaughn.
For example, the villain confronts the hero: "There can only be one big dog, everybody else, they just sniff" while the hero challenges the villain: "Are you all bark and no bite?"
"Walking Tall: The Payback" is a synthetic, redneck thriller with enough action to keep you watching while you shake your head at the things that the citizens let the villains get away with in this 94 minute melodrama.
Instead the viewer is treated to almost 90 interminable minutes of the ethics of wind turbines and a boringly unstable mother having the same dream over and over while doing some research on the side and eventually wandering through the woods at night calling Lucy!
There are endless scenes of the characters tossing and turning while having bad dreams, and the movie completely fails to create an atmosphere of dread.
One of the first sequences is a long shot of a bronzed, shirtless Stewart strolling along a tropical beach, fresh from a snorkel, while the narrator (Stewart, naturally) describes how he's always loved sharks, always been fascinated by them, blah blah blah.
You'll hear all about the "Shark Fin Mafia" while watching the director "bravely" ram a small fishing boat with a much larger ship.
The problem with documentaries is that (while they should be presenting facts objectively) they are all created to serve one purpose in mind: to convince the viewers of the author's ideas/ideals/point of view.
Finally the girl (who's supposed to be like 11 or 12 or something) practically masturbates in the bathtub while the brother sponges her down.
andrews wanted us to receive while reading.
The mother has to put her kids into an attic room while Mister Steptoe eh.. the Grandfather dies.
Well, maybe if it was worth my while.
But that day never comes while Corrine herself marries another man and eventually inherits the money... without telling her father about the children.
Whoever cast the film seemed to have sorted through the "Village of the Damned" rejects in order to find the two youngest (scariest looking couple of children I have ever seen) Chris was, I'm sorry - just nothing like the original character and while Kristy Swansen is very pretty - she just didn't cut it as Cathy.
Penn mugs his way through and attempts to crach a few weak jokes, while Madonna stamps her foot and places her hands on her hips as she squeaks (yes, she squeaks, and you must hear it to believe it) in frustration.
Adam is forced to travel around the Philippines to various places while his family is abused.
Adam walking around in shock trying to comply with lunatics while also trying to think of a way out that doesn't kill his family.
And while Derek Jacobi's Arthur Clennam may be closer to the book's description than Matthew Macfadyen from the BBC version, he and Sarah Pickering have no romantic chemistry.
Follow Adam as he is guided through the darker sides of human nature while he tries to save his family, his unborn child, and his conviction.
), while some alien life form attempts to kill them all.
And while the extensive nudity was not always unwelcome, the majority of it was clearly thrown in for no good reason.
CAVITE, while technically not a one-man show, is just about as close as one can get these days- and it's an impressive piece of work.
If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.
The sharks that surrounded them while they were afloat would have ripped them to shreds at the first sight of food - THEY WOULDN'T SWIM AROUND FOR DAYS AND NOT TRY TO EAT THEM.
Amitabh Bachchan also stars, and while I can't really criticize his performance, his role is terribly flat.
He stops to pick up his friend Timmy Ainley, but Timmy has the sniffles and must stay home with his mother (Rosemary DeCamp) while Mr. Ainley (Ray Milland), a professor of English at the local college, thinks the sniffles are being faked to avoid a math test.
Hodiak's discomfort builds toward angry jealousy while Milland's drinking gets out of control (don't expect a rehash of "Lost Weekend"; the boozing here is mild in comparison).
Mick Molloy struck a vein of freshness with Crackerjack; an under dog tale itself, yet mixed great comedy while nicely taking a stab at lawn bowls.
His girlfriend is breaking up with him while his father dies back home in Philippines.
Instead Boytown relies solely on it's silly premise while the performers actually appearing on screen are uninteresting and lifeless and ultimately unfunny.
Wayne Hope is totally wasted as the butt of lame homosexual jokes while Glenn Robbins, one of the most talented comedic clowns in Australian television history is inexplicably one of the most boring straight men to play the lead in an Australian comedy in recent memory.
This was one of the movies I saw in Cannes last month during the film market (it was not part of the festival, which is different) and possibly the worst movie I've seen in a while.
It oozes homophobia from every rotten frame, and the main message it seems to have is that homosexuals are loathsome people and should loathe themselves, in public, out loud, as often as possible, while prancing about with bad hairstyles.
Other than seeing bits about the girl at the studio he meets and becomes friendly with, the Italian actress he lives with for a while, befriending Martin Landau, and the relationship with his father, there really isn't much to go on.
The previews definitely made it look better than I thought it would, and while some parts were OK, for the most part the movie was not good.
I saw this movie when I attended a free screening of it a couple weeks before it was released, and while I am no big fan of chick flicks, I had hopes for this film.
At this point, her bizarre chain-smoking overworked former bus driver and former something else (I can't recall at the moment) coworker played by Holly Hunter--who smokes everywhere indoors, which I haven't seen happen in real life since the late 70s--suggests she call one of the names from the handheld, a woman who just happens to be a supermodel (of course) who was on the show a while back, and stage a fake interview.
But this fake interview is so that Murphy's character can actually gain info about her boyfriend's exes so that she can find more out about him while also doing the background for a potential show about little black books, but then it turns out later she isn't going to do the story about the black books, but then we aren't really sure.
Even so, everyone was getting up a lot, looking for food in the fridge and checking their cell phones while the film was going.
Eventually, after killing everyone except for the school's punk rock version of MacGyver (who just so happens to have an impromptu love affair with the school nerd while in hiding from their deranged professor), the homeroom teacher takes his own life with very little fanfare, slitting his own throat with a utility knife.
i think movies like camp blood 2 and my bloody valentine, while being retarded, can be quirky and fun.
i assumed later, his dead body would show up, or he would be the killer or something imaginative, but no, he just disappears from the movie, most likely getting out while he could to save his acting career.
There is NOTHING remotely interesting, scary, or redeeming about it and you will truly feel like you wasted 85 minutes of your life AND your voice for screaming at the stupidity you see while watching it!
Voyager would be stranded in a remote sector of space unknown to mankind, truly exploring the unseen while looking for a way back.
make half your audience cry while half are laughing their heads off?
In Postal, at least, he showed some promise of not taking himself too seriously, and while the end result there wasn't exactly a good film, at least it was entertaining.
That doesn't help very much to sympathize with them while they're running around scared.
For example,we see two soldiers standing over a hole while comrades are below and these two soldiers see the VC coming.
They tried to build backgrounds and personalities to the characters but failed miserably, maybe because it was done very lazily, ie having two actors discuss all the characters for our benefit while they eat.
In short, Corman and Boll both produce films that are un-watchable alone, but when enjoyed with friends, while having beers and yelling Mystery Science Theatre type comments at the screen, they can be fairly amusing.
Taskin and Lee have sex on the floor while in an abrupt cut, Bill talks on the phone with the police chief about Jessie not being able to ID Louis in a lineup.
Taskin walks in and Bill pulls a gun while the woman screams "Jared, it's happening again!"
In an example of terrible special effects, Taskin and Bill hijack a car while fighting, but crash into a stack of cardboard boxes (hiding a ramp).
The plot is boringly simple, there are only 3 characters, a mother who's ill, a father that has to leave the house for a while, and a son who according to the movie summary suffers from szicofrenia.
For stars such as Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith to have to utter the crap served up to them must have been repulsive to them - while Ann overacts as she has never done before or after.
I was lucky enough to witness this amazingly entertaining movie while laying hung over on a couch while vacationing in Mexico.
You just can't understand how irritating it is to listen to Bob's English voice make these noises while the Bob onscreen looks only mildly upset.
who turn up from time to time to hang out with the psychologists irritating son and utter some ominous, pseudo-cryptic warnings into the camera while the whole cast try not to laugh.
Fulci continues his usual tradition by casting the worst bunch of actors that could be scrounged up at the local playhouse and giving them a ridiculous script/dialogue to be delivered while giving the audience countless camera shots that pan across the eyes of the actors as they try to make sense of the imminent danger that they have been put in.
Instead, the happy threesome decide to blow off the strange phenomena with a bottle of Xanax while turning a blind eye and deaf ear at the same time.
I'm not exactly sure what Lucio Fulci had in mind while filming this movie, but I think the finished product was of something that not even he could have envisioned!
Nice filming while riding the car.
No interest in the characters hardly any focus on the experiments/plot Lots of random talk, no continuation in the movie No atmosphere, you feel nothing but boredom while watching this movie Boring surroundings Boring sound side of the movie  Conclusion: Not worth watching, even if your a horror fan.
Several times while watching this awful movie I thought of Bugs Bunny.
Something else now: Is Arriaga making a political statement by showing virtually all of the white Americans as defectives in one way or another while all the Latino's are benign, generous and overall, good guys?
The Border Patrol are portrayed as two dimensional bumbling racists while the Mexicans are kindhearted, trying to survive.
I give it a three out of ten because at least McNamara owned up to something, though not nearly enough, while Henry Kissinger still walks the streets with his goodies intact.
Trouble starts when Teri (Theresa Cooney) accidentally shoots and kills Weller's kidnapping henchman while hunting with her dad.
Here's where the spoiler comes in........the original ending  Kerr's memory gradually starts coming back, all the while Adrieanne and Kerr gradually fall in love.
After viewing the film I now understand while he has gone on to only direct one other movie, he's not very good.
The climax, as the house literally begins imploding while sinking into the earth, is a bit too much.
It seems to suffer post-production problems, in script particularly, as characters vanish, while others make such preposterous choices which could cause irreversible results(..not to mention a ridiculous ending which leads us to believe that nothing was done in regards to the crisis of the film, written off as no threat or danger to the communities surrounding the farm whose soil and water could cause a national outbreak).
Lana is a sweet, innocent young woman who has witnessed a great deal of personal tragedy in her life, while Darko is a well known mobster who is basically running for his life from forces who are out to get him.
When they fall on hard times, Darko decides to pimp his sister out for money while his dark past begins slowly but surely to catch up with him.
The first movie "Basket Case" was still a horror movie, while "Basket Case 2" was more like a horror comedy.
Duane still wants out of the whole situation and is retained in a straight jacket while the litter of small Belials are born.
Most offensive is the scene where Molly's older-man crush hands his unconscious girlfriend over to The Geek and encourages him to have his way with her while she's passed out.
Between the scenes of war, dying and gore it works well with claustrophobia and the inevitable (you see your fate coming)... And while it gets down to a very personal level, it says so many things about humans, the desire to live, anger, desperation, motivation and war in general .....  *Tech* One things that really blew my mind: the tunnel-scenes could have been done by anyone at (almost) no costs!!
In short, this is the kind of movie that sits on your head and squeezes it while you yell, "why!
It is a dead end and while eliminating two of the enemy, they loose three guys.
Poor visuals, "Keep an eye out for the background while they are sitting in the cave."
A problem with many Hollywood war flicks like Pearl Harbour or Saving Private Ryan, is that they are just some all American good guy runs around, shoots heaps of enemy with 1 gun while tens of enemy guns have no effect, saves the day and the US and Allied forces are glorified and the enemy are demonised.
Once in a while I like to look for the worst looking title I can find because bad movies make you appreciate everything else in life more.
He has formed an unholy union with a Catholic religious nut who operates the reform school..she believes the Internet is harmful to society and wishes to destroy it forever, while also desiring to quell the sinful image of scantily clad cheerleaders in the process.
The use of lots of stock footage, while boring, wasn't as ineptly handled and the acting isn't quite as bad as you'd expect in a true Ed Wood picture.
In addition, while this is a bad film, so much of it is rather dull and had NOTHING to do with the plot, so it really failed to excite the bad movie buff within me as well.
Put it on the shelf for a while because you won't need to remember it again until you get to the end.
This goes on for quite a while.
So does Lowe, except that he also does a fine job of looking bored while he's making this dud.
Demi's character actually seemed like she was looking for true love, while he just seemed to be an unsure floater.
The only good thing I can say about it is that tarantulas are cool, it has some reasonably nice location shooting & while it's dull I suppose it's sort of watchable & it's just a shame it doesn't deliver much in the way of entertainment as it definitely had potential.
Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo was made for television, so it's probably unfair to expect great things from it; and while the film does have its moments, I really wouldn't add it to the list of films that prove spiders are prime candidates for having horror films made about them.
Unfortunately it would seem that they couldn't afford to hire someone to write an imaginative screenplay either, as despite some standout moments - there aren't a lot of them, and the main sequence in a warehouse, while well done, is really too silly to take seriously if you take a minute to think about it.
(Spoiler) So, the moral of the story is that you transition from being a boy into being a man by moving into your "baby's mamma"s dilapidated apartment and sell stolen clothes on the streets, while probably still cheating on her.
There is no suspense whatsoever, and all we get is to see a crazy psycho boring us with his tedious blablabla theories of murders , psychology and human kind, looking directly to the camera, while he shows shorts scenes of his murders.
After watching this movie (and even while watching it) i kept asking myself why am i torturing myself?, and my only answer was that i can't hardly wait for it to end so i can make some sense of it...  That never happened and i was left (at the end of the movie) in almost total darkness.
The kids find the Japanese sailor in their hide-out place and from there, nothing really happens for a while...it just lags on and on and on...
It shows about 6-7 different stories around the US that include a woman battling to keep custody of her son while the jerk of a father makes her life a living hell, a young man searching for the approval of his mother and estranged father - when his crazy aunt comes in early for their Christmas dinner to give him a new perspective, a young woman who is the maid of honor at her best friend's Christmas Eve wedding and the drama that ensues when it looks as if the wedding may be canceled due to weather not to mention the hidden feelings the young woman has for the groom-to-be, another woman who is trying to escape Christmas after her husband died last year at the same time, a conniving husband who is cheating on his wife while he tells her he is tied up at an airport, and finally the weather man who brings it all together during this once in a lifetime event.
For example, a young and beautiful lady gets a cut across the forehead from hitting a tree branch while riding a horse.
They beat you over the head with middle-school symbolism (his ignoring the telephone while in the middle of playing piano).
However, the movie itself was so weak I was looking for other things to occupy my time while it was on.
GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained.
The plot, which I must say didn't seem so bad, actually turned in to a big pile of junk without sense after a while.
The finale of the film features a birthing scene that looks as though it could have been a Three Stooges short as Abhishek Bachchan plays the clueless obstetrician who apparently gets anxiety attacks while doing his job!
They are constantly yelling at each other while trying too hard to appear as though there is love between them.
while watching deadgirl, i kept thinking/hoping, we get some backstory about the deadgirl.
Noah Segan is not at all convincing as the typical high school rebel gradually metamorphosing into a stoic and ruthless killer, while Shiloh Fernandez is just pitiable as the conscious but loyal friend.
That was Agatha Christie's clever twist, and while I don't mind changes from the source when it made sense, not using the most brilliant part of the story was a bad move and made this movie a weak shell of the book.
Years later, he's stuck in an unsatisfying job while she and their son are shacked up with successful business tycoon Whit (Hank Azaria) a charismatic American with lots to offer.
how Simon pegg was able to walk those last 9 miles in about 5 mph while it was still dark and I'm not sure when i was supposed to laugh as its very poorly written with a small poetic plot.
In fact, the vampires dominate most of the proceedings during the latter stages of the film, while early on there's also excess footage featuring a gypsy couple (who, for plot purposes, unwittingly revive the werewolf which subsequently 'marks' Waldemar Daninsky); however, despite the limited resources at the film-makers' disposal, the Gothic atmosphere is well up to par for the course (though dissipated somewhat by the faded print I watched!
The film presents a repellent point of view: that those who advocate relationships with minors -- and the minors themselves -- are victims of society's intolerance; to make their point more profoundly, the filmmakers make their couple victims in many other ways: Charley's mother and best friend are deaf, his mother was killed by a drunk driver while he watched, his father is senselessly cruel, while Eban has been fired from his job (a boys' athletic coach) and is hounded by his ruthlessly "concerned" parents.
Ray and Hardy play off each other well, but really aren't a team; in each of these films, Ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero, while Hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later "Ollie" character's treatment of "Stanley".
This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring -- something that should never happen in a good action movie.
I will admit I had been looking forward to checking out this film for a while now.
Judy Greer and Thomas McCarthy are fantastic as a husband and wife duo trying to survive professional and personal hardship while their troubled child devolves into a monster.
The Great New Wonderful - a mixture of 5 stories in NYC set in Sept 2002 - a mix of comedy and angst- this low budget movie has several recognizable faces including Stephen Colbert,Edie Falco, Jim Gaffigan , Maggie Gyllenhal,Will Arnett & Olympia Dukakis- but the guys that stole the movie were the 2 Indian bodyguards that lived next to each other.This felt like an art-house movie- nothing wrong with art-house flicks I guess- but after awhile I get tired of the meloncholia and the intrusive soundtracks.This comes out on Tuesday and has the option of watching the movie either as one story or as 5 stories- while all 5 stories have some interesting moments- the best one is the bodygaurd arc.
So while watching the film, none of that came through, even with the titles, and Jim Gaffigan's comment to "When it all went down."
Thirdly, while I actually really liked aspects of GNW, like troubled child story, and Cake designer story, much of it was remarkably dull.
So yesterday afternoon I was looking at a blog about faces that are begging to be punched, and while I didn't think too much of it at the time, I kept coming back to it later that night as I watched the latest (and my first) episode of TBS's sh*t factory otherwise known as "My Boys."
If you're up and bored in the middle of the night while it's on a movie channel, you might as well watch it.
This leads to an anachronistic feel through out the movie and while I was watching it I was expecting there to be a shock revelation at the end where it's revealed the story is set in the 24th century and there had been an Earth shattering catastrophe a couple of centuries before .
Later, while fooling around with the globule, Noah causes an electrical surge that blacks out Seattle, raising the ire of Homeland honcho, Nathaniel Broadman (Michael Clark Duncan, "The Green Mile," "Daredevil").
I was amused as I watched this flick how characters are blunt and honest about others giggling and insulting them while they are still in the room(..such as gardener Ralph who seems to be the butt of everyone's jokes, even though he moves about, saying little, without really warranting such constant ridicule, despite the fact that he's a wee bit creepy).
I guess the most memorable murder sequence will be when Santa starts up the plane while a pilot is working on the engine, the spinning propeller blade chopping him and a female student to pieces.
The aforementioned flat chested redhead also provides most of the nudity, while the buxom and shapely Melody remains fully clothed throughout?
So while the future awaits word on Mimzy's success or failure (that is that rabbits name for anyone that cares), the children run amok by communicating with arachnids, jumping on the beach like an extra from Pixar's The Incredibles and talking to the stuffed animal that represents futures only hope.
Unfortunately, the locations are nondescript, not much stunt work or hard riding, while the outlaw gang gives up without the usual fight.
It looks good, while it's still.
Larissa in particular really seemed to like none of the guys, although apparently her and jock boy were dating for a quite a while afterwards.
All the while nothing all that horrifying really occurs as we are treated to a few flashback like scenes.
I love low budget horror trash as much as anyone else, but  something ought to happen every once in a while, and if you are  going to have an attractive woman play a herpatologist in a horror  film she had better be seen at least topless & getting far more out  of her career than she bargained on, or you have blown it.
Stuff blows up every once in a while.
Now while the "filming locations" section here at IMDb claims this movie WAS actually shot in Hawaii, I have my doubts.
There's a bare minimum of character development between these two; she's ambitious and wants to discover a new species, while he is a widower who has come to the area to escape "the psychotic bulls**t" he encountered at his previous job in Reno.
I didn't believe any of it while watching it, I wonder how someone could actually believe the movie was "real".
The good things: while I think the director tipped his hand by showing us LIzzie's scarred face near the beginning, her determined running style was truly frightening.
Don't fall for it, 'In The Dark' is one of the most sloppily conceived, hackneyed and unintentionally incoherent films in a long while.
We are subjected to long scenes of one of the more annoying characters filming himself make rude comments and mock his equally annoying mother, and act like a total retard detailing his plan to sneak out while his mother is fast asleep behind him in the couch.
She devotes her life to her family while her teenage daughter and ambitious husband grow increasingly independent.
The scene in which he kisses Grace, while somewhat unexpected, is powerful.
We wade through long dialogues over what the plot is about (while walking around in a cardboard set).
Speaking of ending, the dad in the movie gets to moon the audience while walking around the house wearing only his pajama top (Mom stays fully clothed) and trying to get Mom to break her diet.
From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face.
Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity.
In the end the teenagers are cleared of suspicion, while a goofy -yet pompous- military expedition inadvertently causes the spaceship to blow up.
I know earthquake happened a lot in Japan, but please, why must you make the earthquake happened while Jun is on the top of the chimney?
The guy meets his ethnic friends in broad daylight while working undercover as a proNazi.
Then the guy who was outside went into the house and stayed in there for a while with some old man.
The siblings Noah (Chris O'Neal) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) travel with their mother Jo (Joely Richardson) from Seattle to the family cottage in Whidbey Island to spend a couple of days while their workaholic father David Wilder (Timothy Hutton) is working.
The leaders, Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones, ham it up in a couple of brief scenes a bit more than the "standard" "Beat It" rejects, and while that is marginally entertaining for about 5 seconds, it hardly makes for a worthwhile movie.
Instead of this movie, you could just watch Mad Max and Doomsday while completely hammered, then take the resulting mess of memories and remove anything entertaining or intriguing, it will be the same experience but far more fun.
Expect young kids to twist, squirm, and talk while you are trying to catch the story.
The one guy who is smart enough to leave/escape, stupidly returns to rescue a girl who then doesn't want to leave until she can save the rest; the guy stupidly follows and gets killed while saving her sorry back yet again.
And while it's among the top of the "8 films to die for", that's more of an indictment on how crappy most of those films were than anything else.
Despite having flaws it is watchable, though its probably best watched while doing something else (I'm guessing that you'll probably fall asleep if you watch it straight).
Considering that I'm an actual disc jockey, I can say that most of what you've seen in this movie, while remotely possible, isn't in reality.
Remember when John Wayne tells the woman that he's a loner, gets on his horse and rides away while she cries and looks pained?
An apotheosis of bad taste comes when a paralytic wants to take a leak, so poppa and momma prop him up while Hugo Dugay is rummaging for his pissing gimmick.
The movie is too long, with a running time of a bit over 2 hours, and while the first hour seemed pretty well paced, the whole concept got a bit tired after that.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
Anyway, the dog does all kinds of deadly tricks, like a curling iron in the bath tub, jumping out of the seat of a car to scare the owner backward into oncoming traffic, and even strangulation of her owner's boyfriend with the dog leash while he's dozing up against a tree.....and the guy is dead and the dog is lying by his side as though nothing had happened, and the cops are looking for someone that strangled him while a 100-lb.
I've been after this movie for a while, though mainly because of the cool VHS cover and the fact that Yvonne De Carlo is in it.
This is not a great example of British film making, so if you happen to chance upon it while flicking through the channels - you have been warned!
Plus the random inclusion of disgusting and/or completely unnecessary scenes such as a priest going after a young boy, Stephen Mangan's genitalia, one of the Irish comedians being f*sted while holding some puppets, you get what I mean.
The movie is too simplistic, trying to comment on a situational phenomenon while forcing its way through a plot that would be interesting if it seemed less contrived.
No truly stupid gags, nothing with bodily excretions, none of that really, and if anything the humor, of a little wild and over-the-top in variety (some of which I was laughing at alone while the other kids were silent), is innocent and sort of knowing of the split of imagination between children and adults.
Upon arrival at Court he finds that he is missing a vital document and realises that he must have accidentally left it with Gipson while the two were exchanging names and addresses.
how dumb, come on people... i can't see this is a funny show at all, i even watched a million little fibers episode and it was not funny at all... they didn't respect Oprah's character and they made fun of her, i just wonder why we laugh to something while other's cry when they watch it... u know y i cried simply because media shows Americans and the whole world another face of Islam...a face they created especially for them.
Especially when watching a parody movie I expect a hilarious firework of jokes without any pauses and not some small firecrackers burning down once in a while.
Everyone in the theater waited impatiently while the projectionist repaired the film.
For a while it was fun to watch Richard Burton recite idiotic dialogue in a stupid plot line, and do it badly.
), while her old house is on fire because of a car crash involving Louise Fletcher.
I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore.
Former fans used to urge them to retire while they had a shred of dignity left.
Some say that everything the band had in terms of potential or soul died with Cliff Burton, and while it took a while for this to become apparent, I can only agree.
Not only that, but the fact that their problems are entirely voluntary while people with problems of an involuntary nature who barely have enough to eat, leave alone make a film about the matter...  Well, to put it bluntly, this is not just a slap in the face to fans, former or otherwise.
A while back I did a review on JUMPER and called it pointless.
Mostly I manage to avoid these type of thing by never watching films with Vince Vaughan but once in a while you let your guard down.
A while later he exit in the middle of the film.
To Ellis (as I am sure it was), remember the feeling you had while watching the film.
Yes, unhealthily fat women (and the men who go for them) exist in life and online, but this film--which equals "Hostel" and "Wolf Creek" in sheer ugliness while possessing about one-tenth the movie-making smarts of both put together--has no reason to be.
The premise of the film seemed promising but it failed to deliver and after a while i gave in and turned it off.
If you wanted to watch something that scars you for a while, then in that case I deeply suggest you stay out of watching this movie!Evren Buyruk
Your entertainment dollar would be better spent on gas to go driving around running over stray dogs while dressed as Edna Turnblatt.
Plenty of action while the story never drags.
The new suits, while flashy, are just blatant copies of UC suits.
There are a couple almost funny moments, like one teen losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, while she's being attacked by raccoons....the realization of her plight while he's still busy is probably the highlight of the movie, such as it is.
Perhaps they just wanted to show that Chopin was starved for sex while living with Sand, but there were other ways to show that.
Believe me, i have seen many bad Korean movies and i still accept it if it can help me chase my boredom for a while,but this movie is just nonsensical, it makes me wonder how can a director can make a movie this bad!
while she's gone the girl working at this cafe along with just about every other girl in the universe, makes a play for him but he can't forget his bitchy annoying girlfriend he still loves for some inexplicable reason.
OK really my comprehension of the film totally broke down when it got to the point that I didn't know whether it was the cafe girl or the original girl post surgery who was making his life miserable at about midpoint... sigh... all the while I just wanted him for myself to take him away from this witchy world in which these horrible women were there to make him so unhappy.
Plus, while CAR WASH is not for everyone's taste, I liked the film and found many of the characters likable.
If you are planning for a Saturday morning movie to watch in bed while eating breakfast, then this is your movie.
but in this movie, chapelle's reduced to playing the silly black sidekick, danny devito is given NOTHING to work with, and macdonald is so unfunny i found myself thinking about cleaning house while the video was on.
Big city girl Josie (Mary Sellers) has just arrived back in her small Alaskan hometown for an extended stay with her mother and kid brother, and decides to possibly reconcile with her former high school boyfriend Matt (Jason Saucier) while she's there.
And unfortunately, while TROLL 2 failed in an enjoyable awful way, this one fails to reach that film's same level of redeeming unintentional hilarity.
The pain felt while watching this movie is almost life changing.
One gets stranded at a small gas station, while the other is returning to her small town home after having left it and her fiancÃ© when she was in high school.
you have spent much time with him while making this documentary which HE allowed you to and innocently answered all your questions giving you perfect answers.
And though he's already been caught by both the police and his wife in flagrante delicto, he has no problem getting it on with the blond boy in his hotel room while his wife reads Cosmo by the poolside (we don't see this happen, but it's clearly implied).
Part 2 consists of a series of musical montages thrown in every once in a while, presumably to advance the story line and wake up the audience.
What was amazing is that the female lead didn't even twist her ankle while doing acrobatic stunts in high heels!
The first couple of minutes between Alf and Beverly Archer(Harriette Byrd in past episodes) was funny but then the film isn't about Alf so much as Military abuse of authority and the love story of two young Doctors who befriend Alf while he is in captivity with the Alien Task Force.
This movie has an ecological message to it, and while important, always brings a movie down.
What I got was a glossy soap opera interlaced with tit-bits of Cinemax porn, featuring 20-somethings hamming it up while naked.
HBO's programs are the products of creators genuinely keen on their subjects and time periods, while this plodding, vapid Showtime program is another lame attempt to mimic a rival's glory.
"You have egg on your beard" says Robin to John while being tortured.
We have the heroic, clean, brave Englishman as Captain Curry who in the end kills his crooked and brutal ex-Wehrmacht German subordinate, while the savages mangle the cowardly young French-(Belgian ?)
Worst moments: the fairly direct rip-off of Pulp Fiction by wrapping back around from beginning to end with two somewhat comical criminals having a discussion in a diner, and Tim Allen trying to play the part of the producer listening to a pitch while having no timing for such dialog.
Together they escape (in one of the absolute hands down most moronic escape sequences to make it to film - and I'm only using a little hyperbole), and take on new identities to hide out from the law while retrieving the diamonds.
Hilarious hijinks supposedly ensue as the mob now try to kill Slater, thinking he is the real Tout, while Slater tries to get the diamonds.
Too bad for the investors in the insurance firm, but apparently: policies for many millions of dollars were written on the lives of just two executives; the insurer didn't grasp the problem of moral hazard, and write the policies to exclude payment in the event of suicide; and the insurer is sufficiently solvent to make a huge payment, even while the rest of the financial structure seems to be in crisis.
* Human Behavior: Why, knowing what Corneilus and Zira told them about the future, would mankind and human government permit the keeping of apes as pets and eventual slaves, while increasing their intelligence and capabilities?
Jerk of a boyfriend has writers block and becomes a drunk, while the girlfriend supports them both (we see no emotional connection in the actors or reason for us to believe they are even sleeping together, let alone in a relationship).
A couple leave New York city to move in a half star motel room in Maine( for some reason, I just thought of the actors) so the guy ( Don Wood) can write his best selling novel, while his girlfriend works in a library.
The story: Two people decided to hole up in a small room at a rundown motel so he could write his next great play while his girlfriend works at a menial job in town to supporting him.
It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes.
I thought of a couple of director Takashi Miike's movies while watching Full Metal Yakuza- Ichi the Killer and Izo- because of what they have sort of in line with it.
do not waste your money on this and if you are looking for cheap laughs you will be waiting a while.
People will celebrate its oddness of colliding civilizations and languages while also mentioning the threads of overlap in poor behavior in both the 'mudpeople' and the merely dressed better actors - this is not enough to make a good film.
She defends the last vest ages of The Really Wild, while her forest is altered and destroyed to make way for scout camps, roads, condos, subdivisions and strip malls, vanquished tellingly by a mouse who thinks he's human and a cat who has forgotten his catness.
Lady of the Tropics was shot while Hedy Lamarr was on hiatus from the ill-fated I Take This Woman.
Good costumes for Abhishek especially while he is at Turkey.
It is interesting how she predicts her d-day to be 420 days while the course of this disease is considered highly unpredictable with most people living a full life sans quality.
Yet, while telling a strong, funny, gripping, well-acted story of a young gangster's rise to power, it also manages to paint a devastating picture of how and why crime has spiraled out of control in the new South Africa.
Then I'd see the trailer while waiting for another movie and think it would be good.
Then the opening credits ended and there's David Duchovny, talking to his son while he (the son) is on the toilet and explaining how a fart can be better than a poop.
Otherwise, the film features annoyingly flashy direction, while the traits of the supporting characters range from the obnoxious (the cardsharp and the villainous store owner) to the embarrassing (Joyce Van Patten reminiscing about her past as a champion swimmer and Sheree North's bout with drunkenness).
Now shut up while I fool you some more.
As both couples later go to the park to relax on benches where "No Spooning" signs pop up, Fatty goes to Harry's wife and walks with her while Harry goes to Mabel where she's is sitting.
Death after death proves tiresome after a while, while the usual dumb characters become more annoying as the movie drags on.
Hewitt is excellent as usual, while Brandy brings a freshness to the screen as her best friend.
But this time it's idiocy all the way, from the title (the most inaccurate title for a sequel since "Rambo III") to the climax featuring the world's only six-shooter that fires eight bullets, while Danny Cannon's direction and John Frizzell's score duke it out to see which is the most OTT (the music wins).
Why is it that anything bad just goes on and on and on, while good stories are killed in mid-flight: Firefly, Surface, Invasion etc etc etc?
They would have been better off starting the story with his tragic death... somewhere in the lines of -he cut off his own head while shaving.
Playing with your friends is fun for a while, but there are better and more intricate games that actually give something in return while doing so.
The family cries poverty while adding nearly a million in improvements to the home and taking expensive vacations.
And while this cant replace the original classic, I feel that if it does end up being a bit of film buff trivia then future generations will be missing an enjoyable two hours.
There's are many elements that make it what it is...  First thing is the film takes itself way too seriously, while the basic concept the movie is based on is utterly ridiculous.
while it starts with a very much ANTI- war vibe it leads the viewer to believe that there is ONLY one way.this movie paves the WAY to drafting legislation.
another interesting observation is that while playing with the idea of deserting, the option is never considered out of FEAR.
Then, he beats every villain so easily, even showing his blue butt while standing over a missile, please.
I lost track of the amount of scenes we have to endure where characters introduce themselves to other characters after a few episodes (in the second episode alone, Chris introduces himself to Sonic, then the next day introduces himself to Tails and Cream, who introduce themselves to Chris, who introduces them to his grandfather), and the lack of action the setting forces upon us (Sonic and company moves into Chris' household, and have to hide from everyone else for a few more episodes, then get the attention of the outside world after that) forces the writers to hammer out awkward "Komedy" (like the excruciating seventh episode, where Cream spends most of the time hiding from the household while a party is being hosted and generally gets into all sorts of wacky hijinks) to try and make the complete lack of action more tolerable, but are really just making the show even less dignified than the fourth Home Alone movie (you know, the made for TV one with French Stewart as Marv).
Go rent Mission Impossible, and while your at it, see if you can find Woo's Asian films, like Killer.
Next time I ride my moped I'll hop off and slide down the street alongside of it wearing my jandals while shooting a pea shooter at bulls eye targets on passing lamposts.
In the end, while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff (which would have been a relief).
Some other laughable points in this film include:  The painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down a giant ventilator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.
This cheap imitation of "The Night Of The Living Dead" is an earnest attempt to revive the "appeal" (and the chills) of the 1968 film, but while most of the appropriate ingredients seem to be in place, somehow they don't work.
I've got no idea why this film was banned, as while there are gore sequences in the film; none of them are particularly gruesome, and I reckon that whoever made up the actual 'Video Nasty' list decided to take this film out of circulation because it's a zombie film.
But before we go, here are the Dave Clark Five and The Animals to sing some more songs you've never heard of while we film them in a straight-on close up that looks like a mugshot.
Yes, I watched this on Turner Classic Movies while waiting for the plumbers to come and fix a badly broken set of pipes.
Daniel Mann directed, poorly; his actors seem encouraged to be theatrical, while the hysterical pitch of the piece steadily climbs to a ridiculous level.
And while the acting is okay, some scenes - such as the kissing-in-the-swimming-pool bit - look as cheesy as if they were lifted straight from "The L Word" or a soft-core lesbian sex flick; how director Katherine Brooks managed to hire people like Elizabeth Shue, Will Patton and the ever-magnificent Frances Conroy for her latest effort ("Waking Madison") is beyond me.
It was a cold and rather mechanical scene filmed above the boyfriend while he is literally "pumping" the conflicted lesbian teacher with the fervor and passionate skill of a mongoose.
Not to mention that, after Tea's mum died because of Irena, Tea continues to write to Irena while she is in jail and pick her from prison years later.
Come to think of it, while Ms.Chevalier's fictional ingÃ©nue surfaces as the only noble character in the entire story, her fictional renditions of the Vermeer family cast them as the horrid folks from which she must attempt to shield herself.
The story was simply about Jane wanting to find an anniversary present for Tarzan, and while doing so in the jungle, she starts remembering the adventures they've had so far.
By the way, it also features Liam Neeson at his most constipated, and Natasha Richardson's along for the ride too, though its hard to notice either of them while Jodie's so busy making funny faces and gurgling.
The acting is okay while the tension level is rather weak.
Neil Giuntoli stands in this time for Michael Rooker (the original Henry) and, while he has a couple of effective scenes of underlying, stoic menace, for the most part he doesn't make much of an impression.
And while some of this cheese is initially good for a laugh eventually it all wears very thin.
But it has to be the most stupidly bad comedy film ever made, while watching the film you cant help but think that if the story was put in the right hands it probably would have been a good movie (with Jim Carrey in the lead and maybe David Zucker directing) but it is one of those films that is so dumb SO badly acted and directed that you actually cant help but laugh all the way through it, so does this make it a good comedy because its funny for all the wrong reasons?, NO!
Some of them appear like rotting corpses, while others are "fresh."
For now, I recommend watching The Orphanage or May while you await better cult horror films.
How many times did I myself catch a ride home in this manner while in school...always feeling a tiny bit chilled by the possibility of danger.
For a while, DeMille might have become a good filmmaker; he made this picture after that.
They both fall in love while he helps her deal with her problems.
Billy Connolly is held back and allowed to show only a few glimpses of his great comedy and acting talent, while Sharon Stone goes way over the top as she tries to compensate.
It sets itself up for self-parody -- satirizing the old cartoon show and its absurdities while also managing to make fun of some clichÃ©s of cartoons and feature-film spin-offs.
I figured out why after a while.
And while I respect Clooney for adding to the realism, I'm very sorry for the Clooney admirers who have to sit through this just to see a firm, shaved tush.
This bland, vanilla, and downright dull biopic contradicts itself by palming off Exner as a bright woman who just happened to fall in love with rich and influential men while she behaves like a dunce who just can't keep her panties on.
Laurence Olivier gives possibly the worst performance of his career while Gregory Peck seems to be giving an impersonation of Basil Fawlty , oh gawd even James Mason is bad and that's not something I can say lightly   Yeah this is an entertaining movie but if you're making a thriller it's vital that you thrill the audience and not have them rolling in the aisles with something that feels like it's a sequel to THE PRODUCERS .
Flimsy fights come and go, as do cheese laden songs, while the dialogue is as stilted {read from auto-cue it looks like} as can be.
When a young lower class black fellow from the ghetto,who aspires to be a journalist,wants to meet his idol,a black tv newsman while that tv news reporter is at a crime scene,and then when that same older classy black tv reporter,who turns down the young man's offer to see a video of the young man's work,gets killed in an accident while at the crime scene,the young black fellow takes his place reporting from the crime scene and becomes a hit with local viewers and the tv station and its' news producer.Such is the story of Dexter Jackson in the 1991 film Livin'Large,about a young black man who learns that despite the rewards of fame and money to never forget where you come.
I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful "Showgirls," which I've never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare.
Victor 'fixes' his Fathers hunting rifles which backfires killing him while out shooting.
He does explain why, indirectly: When seeing her for the first time in a while, he comments, appreciatively, that she's put on some weight "in a couple of places."
The female characters are also nicely played, with O'Mara oozing feline sexuality as the promiscuous housekeeper, while Hammer regular Veronica Carlson is also solid as Frankenstein's childhood friend.
After a while, it becomes obvious to one passenger that they are all dead but most won't believe him.
Everyone around her gets owned while she keeps having random visions of her in a bath.
The gore levels are disappointing, a couple of people are stabbed by the Grim Reaper while someone has pencils stuck in their face & someone is sliced in half in an unconvincing totally bloodless CGI computer effect.
After we finished the book, our class watched this movie...while I had fun watching it because its so terrible at points I couldn't stop laughing, it's really a travesty.
But, I'd have to say the worst part was when Carton and the seamstress started making out randomly while they were at the Guillitine.
close-up shots), while the use of process photography in the scene where they convene in the sugar factory is very obvious Â effectively destroying the intended illusion of the situation!
At least, the thing is entertaining enough while it's on Â and I'd still like to check out director Gordon's other Wells adaptation, THE FOOD OF THE GODS (1976), eventually...
The part that really, really irked me was when this older couple, knowing darn well that there where killer ants everywhere eating everything in sight, decided while running away from the ants (while the other characters were trying to find a boat and go down the river to escape the ants) they were going to take a different route and go DEEPER in the woods - how idiotic was that!
I found myself wondering why, for example, I was watching people line dance for a while, and why they went swimming at one point.
This movie, while it was a good story, was horribly acted.
The start of the film just was so uncoordinated while searching for the girl his fat enemy who mind you put up a huge fight by being chucks punching bag get's thrown out of a window only to hear Chucks reason for it.
It was as painful as watching someone chainsaw my penis off while watching a new Steven Seagal movie.
He doesn't really have the charisma of an Arnold, and somehow doesn't have star power, he seems to much of a nice guy, everyman, while similarly he didn't get by on his looks either.
Chuck swings punches like John Wayne cowboy fighting, on his master shot, while the coverage shots are filming his double from behind doing the same dull punching slightly faster, and throwing in the odd kick.
I really should stop watching all these DTV action films,but every once in a while you find a surprising gem in a batch,however The Cutler is definitely not one of them.
The Core was much better done with better special effects while Depp Core looked like it was made on a long weekend in the American southwest.
In the second episode we are treated to a candid camera-like take of a cross/eyed shepherd milking the flock and making cheese while feeding his pig.
In fact, while Doris Day's character was supposed to be cute, I just prefer to believe that she was uglier than any of those zombies.
If you consider it illogical to mention him and "Grindhouse" while reviewing this movie...well, I consider this movie as much a piece of crap as any of the 9/11 hijackers, and I think that I speak for at least most of my generation when I say that we far prefer gross-out exploitation movies to anything starring Doris Day.
PS about Berlusconi: maybe I was expecting more of a fierce political story and it's a shame that, while bragging it is one, Il Caimano's back-story could have been about the private affairs of some Italian soccer star without changing the main story.
Let me just keep teaching my class while time ticks away.
His car blows up while he and the red head are a few feet away, are they scared?
All movies require the "suspension of disbelief," that elastic band around our rational minds which allows us to get involved in fiction while knowing it isn't real.
I would like to know what Pacino was on while reading the script, because I don't believe that an actor of his caliber would agree to do this film while stone cold sober.
It was too unbelievable and too many twists to be considered worth while watching.
A thriller about a college professor who, while moonlighting as a forensic psychiatrist for the FBI, receives a death threat telling him that he has only 88 minutes to live.
A woman is hung by her legs while a man cuts and rapes her.
This all happens while her husband is trying to make it in the medical field and is often out of town.
We get no information about their musical backgrounds, and their idea of jamming is to feign a version of "Iko Iko" while driving in their stolen van (I say 'feign' because the sound of their unison vocals is distinctly studio-enhanced).
One day, while tooling around in his pristine Maverick, rich boy Jody decides to take the road less traveled and ends up with these loons.
In a supporting role, Melissa's witch sister, (who resembles a cross between an extremely wrinkled leather coat and a troll doll) gleefully traipses about the family walnut farm pitchforking innocent farmers and meat hooking unaware sherriff's deputies, all the while making dolphin-esque squeals, and holding on to her favorite hideously ugly porcelain doll.
Unfortunately, I had to watch it while wide awake, 100% sober, and undistracted by any opportunity to smooch and make out.
One for the under 12s while you do the tax return.
However, while Pixar continues to evolve the genre by actually adding some story content, Dreamworks refuse to let go of the classic un-original storyline.
So I was very happy when I saw a preview a long while back that there was going to be a movie about the book.
For example, large, cumbersome hallway vehicles inside of space stations in which astronauts may sit and enjoy the ride while others can just walk beside the slow moving motorized box while moving from one hallway to the next bend.
Women will be required to wear plain colored, short, cute dresses and their hair long and brushed (or curled), while men will wear various space suits or police uniforms with badges.
If this happens while in the midst of a space fight, simply throw your state-of-the-art laser gun at the space monster.
It starts of with our two male twits beefing about who should get missy and be in charge while missy love interest stands about looking vapid and stews up the friction between these losers even more.
And you have to see Turner and Michael Douglas hanging by their wrists over a bottomless pit while rats gnaw at the ropes suspending them.
Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner reprise their roles with no great flair, while Danny De Vito (in tow) provides some comic relief.
And while SOME of them are actually highly offensive BUT well-made, this one is a bore even if it weren't full of racial stereotypes.
Here's our "plot" more or less: six people, each a cartoonish stereotype representing a "deadly sin," (a greedy lawyer, a vain gay man, a lesbian, a rich bitch, a male chauvinist pig, and a promiscuous former teen-queen) return to their now-closed high school for a ten-year reunion, where they quickly discover that they're the ONLY people in the school building aside from a psychotic killer who locks the doors and proceeds to pick them off one by one while wearing a variety of masks and costumes.
They also tend to stand around in shock and horror after every death while the killer makes a long, drawn-out speech about their sinful lives, letting him say his piece rather than simply rushing the guy and trying to kick his ass.
They always persist in running off alone on pointless errands, instead of sticking together and overwhelming an often vulnerable looking killer (such as the "Redeemer" here) through the sheer force of a mass attack while they still have the advantage of superior numbers.
The climactic battle is pretty impressive, and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.
The script itself was lacking severely and even with a poor script, the acting couldn't deliver an even halfway mediocre attempt at what would have made it a halfway decent movie to watch while intoxicated with this being the only movie showing within a 500 mile radius.
There are a few other relatively known actors in here, but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now (Norbit anybody?)
Even at their last meeting, Julia seemed as superficial and abrupt with Lillian as ever, while Lillian once again morphed from ice princess to puppy dog.
The film gets a bit dull after a while, and it drags in a couple of places too.
The said dwarf is employed by the nightclub to prance around on stage while the girls are performing, although it is never explained why the club owner assumed that this bizarre diversion would increase the erotic allure of their performances.
This movie comes on cable every once in a while, and I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame.
So while we may like Augusta and think she's funny, she can't anchor the story.
Alec McCowen plays the uptight Henry perfectly, secretly loving the adventure and the worlds it opens up to him while being a nervous wreck at each new moment.
But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them.
Buck is in perpetual pre-pubescence, and while Chuck had moved away when they were kids and developed into a normally functioning person, Buck stayed behind in the town and developed a psychotic, homo erotic fixation for his old friend Chuck.
Worse, while Chuck tries to avoid his exceptionally creepy friend, it becomes exceedingly difficult when Buck fails to grasp any sort of reality that things are different and forever will be.
Unlike the rowdy broadness of the Patrick Dennis play and the Rosalind Russell film, George Cukor's adaptation of the Greene work tries to be high-toned and literary, while simultaneously striving to seem madcap and funny.
This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while.
Third, there are numerous red herring "boo" scenes, even Condon admits this, which greatly limit the fear factor after a while; because, we're just waiting for the next false alarm to "scare" us.
I'd read that you could see the bar holding up the spaceship in flight or that it flies against a blue sky while from the inside of the ship, space looks black.
The print I saw shows a Warner Brothers logo on front while there is an RKO emblem at the end of the movie.
"First Men in the Moon" (while not a great film) is superior in virtually every detail to "From the Earth to the Moon".
It's obvious that while you have the talent (or luck) to get projects off the ground, you've no idea about how to execute a film.
The premise/plot is a decent yet typical tale of revenge while the fight choreographing is superb.
I think that while Richard Grieco might be good looking, he's still pretty much a cheese-puff!
She is thus spoiled by her poor husband, trying to be nice and give her what she wants while knowing that things he gives into will be bad in the end.
The film's plot is: Our fearless wrestling heroes have to stop a plot involving genetically engineered zombies and a zombie breeding scheme involving human incubators in Zombie King and friends' bid to take over the world -- all while running around looking like bargain basement trick-or-treaters.
I will confess I never (though I lived in NYC at the time) saw this on Broadway--and despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better, while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE, I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.
At the Sundance screening of this film, the director told us that the "evergreen" of the title referred to the green envy the main character feels toward those who have so much while she does not.
After the death of his older rocker brother Dean of overdose, the rebel sixteen year-old David Forrester (Raviv Ullman) becomes bitter and obsessed with death, while grieving his brother.
It bored me, and while technically it was rather standard with some bottom of the barrel choices in wonky make-up FX (no really cheap Halloween masks) and clumsy special effects.
At least the ending (while tacky) is unexpected.
However, while I loved and still love Lewis' 1960s gore films, "Taste of Blood" is EASILY the weakest effort in the Lewis horror library.
The ONLY valid reason for this piece of (expletive deleted) to exist is to show to film students and budding actors how to try to act when the material is SO bad....Viggo and McHattie, i always knew were undervalued actors but they are positively heroic in my mind, for continuing to move and speak what was given to them by Beth B.......  And Dominique Davolos was actually the emotional center of the film in that Beth B gave her marvelous NATURAL speech to speak, while reacting to the bullshit that Viggo and McHattie had to utter....she was the ONLY normal relation to the average experience of the film-goer...  i personally despise Christianity, but this garbage of film-making is an unfair insult to Christianity as religion...  AND THE MUSIC WAS HORRIBLE!!
All his expression is in his eyebrows while his voice remains the same.
Equally impressive was the bond between the main four male characters who, while different, are all intellectual and successful men.
Would you hire a lodge for the weekend with your girlfriend, while the one who rents it to you stays in it during that weekend as well?
Lennon comes off as a complete dick head with no artistic qualities and Stu as some sort of genius while he could hardly play bass.
It actually does work for a while.
It looks like the actors had a lot of fun while shooting this filmÂtoo bad they can't convey it to the audience.
Dracula's trials and tribulations while trying to survive a late 70's New York are mildly amusing but again nothing that really made me laugh out loud.
A group of bad kids try to make a good girl a drug addict like them, while an undercover reporter tries to help her.
Yes, it's a romantic comedy-drama full of moments that we've seen done before and while unoriginality is not a cinematic sin (or, good grief, we would rarely see any film released in cinemas) it isn't a good thing when everything has been done BETTER than the movie you're currently watching.
Like The World's Strongest, there's a really, really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze...disturbing is the fact that Gohan, while singing, is pretty much drugged out himself.
One scene in the film shows a woman being blocked in and made to climb out of a bus window showing her underwear and burning her legs while the men laugh at her but the viewers are encouraged to view her as the villain.
Blakey's laugh and double takes are a wonder to behold, and, while supposed to be the villain, he's far, far more likeable than the crass Stan and Jack.
The complex dynamics of such a polemic are resolved by Pat Coombs and cohorts yelling "come on, girls, let's sort this little boy out", while sticking an air hose up Stan's trousers.
FarnumÂJudas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving typeÂis Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinctionÂ  Brom GarretÂthe naÃ¯ve city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claimÂpursues his remedies in some other fashionÂ   SophiaÂthe little survivorÂcould settle who killed her people, road agents or SiouxÂ  JewelÂborn with difficulties and hardships that got no cureÂwants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazyÂ  Charlie UtterÂwho considers himself an important hand at the freight businessÂ plays a man too loyal and honest for his own goodÂ  Whitney EllsworthÂwho saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridgeÂseemed very competent and trustworthyÂ  Mr. WuÂthe only source of opium in the campÂfinds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occursÂ   SmithÂthe Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of moralsÂknows from past experience that it's a solace having friendsÂ   Ian McShane is a joy to watchÂ He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a wordÂ McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he givesÂ  While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm Â Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killingÂ  Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperamentÂ Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killedÂ He took their five-year-old boy as his own sonÂ  The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul playÂ She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing herÂ She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok aroundÂ When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weakÂ  There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood'Â It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violentÂ If you love Westerns, don't miss it!
Lola goes throughout the movie doing nothing but complaining and lying while her only friend puts up with it.
Then they have this scene where the two girls are in the bedroom of Sid Arthur having a pillow fight while there's a party (thrown by a rock star) going on downstairs.
Despite a high pace, endless attempts at humour and lots of stereotypes (for instance, all black people are badass rapper-type characters while all the whiteys are stiff senators or gay computer hackers - however did they come up with this stuff?
The basic concept is a hip-hop James Bond, and while it sounds like a cool concept that you couldn't possibly mess up, no, these guys messed it up... its not Ice Cube's fault, he's no actor but I've seen him do better than this if the movie has a script and some direction.
I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.
"Scrapple" is a very well done and beautifully shot indie about a small time pot dealer who finds himself in over his head while trying to finance a humble house in a small Colorado hippie town to provide a better life for himself and his brother, a Vietnam vet who lives in a veterans hospital.
Some characters speak in broken English, some characters are dubbed into English from their various languages (this movie features both Japanese and Chinese actors and dialogue), and the rest of the characters spoke in their own language while English subtitles accompanied their words.
The young leads are OK (Wu's transition from beleaguered second-in-command to ruthless hard man is surprisingly convincing), while Tsang spends much of his screen time trading insults with his younger, slicker police counterpart (Moses Chan).
I stumbled upon Gen-X Cops (1999) while I was watching television on satellite.
I was expecting a big death sequence here and there, but wait- -the fight stops, and the villain allows the heroes to make it out of the building if they can, while the villain stays to die in an explosion.
She marries, has kids, but lives in a camp for a while.
And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.
After a while, it is all rather tiresome and fails to satisfy as the best of the old Columbo series did.
I was in China as an English teacher and worked in four different universities while there.
Most people my age did not have any photos of themselves or their families taken while they were growing up.
I'm giving this 4 out of 10 because while agree with the other posters that the film lacked any sort of clarity or even a reason for being, there were a few moments in there that were sort of interesting.
In the case of PHANTOM, each time it gets mutated further and further from the original, and while the results may be intriguing to behold, each version is like an entirely different story!
So it was that the 1943 remake used the original merely as a springboard for what was really a Nelson Eddy-Jeannete McDonald musical-comedy, pushing the "real" star almost out of his own picture, and completely changing the back-story (while ironically restoring the original ending from the book-- but almost nothing else).
And so it was that the 1963 Hammer version totally ignored the original, and used the famous and popular '43 version (my Dad saw it while in the army and LOVED it) as its springboard, to do the typical "Hammer" thing of "different for the sake of different", crafting a film where every single frame screams "Hammer" (was there ever a studio where the finished product was SO uniquely recognizable?).
AND, so it was that this 1983 TV version appears to haphazardly take elements from ALL 3 previous films, and mix them together in a jumble that, while some bits seem nicely-done, others are just HORRIBLE, and the overall product is just a jumbled, at times nearly-incoherent MESS.
I'm not sure what to make of Michael York's character in here-- he starts out likable, then turns into a heel, then winds up being the one who investigates and learns the truth about The Phantom, while the police inspector is merely a DOLT.
After going to such lengths to make her the success his wife wasn't able to be, he suddenly changes his mind for no apparent reason and wants to keep her "safe" while the vicious Prima Donna he earlier drove away COMES BACK.
For those of you in the States find a Veteran and ask him about the truth, while there is still time?
This movie was made in 1978, right after the release of Star Wars, and a while after Star Trek.
But while Star Trek was endearing, this was not.
Every once in a while, a bunch of colors will flash across the screen for half a minute.
All of these actors sounded stilted and unoriginal while delivering their lines.
The cast is amazing for what had to be a fairly low budget RKO picture from the mid-1950's; Randolph Scott was an established star while Forrest Tucker, J. Carrol Naish, and Denver Pyle were all established, talented Western performers and Edgar Buchanan was one of the best Western character actors of all time.
The movie was full of countless clichÃ©s: saving her future charge from being run over in the park while his mother is nowhere to be found, being forced to live in a shoe box of a room next to the washing machine, catching Mr. X cheating on his wife, and catching the eye of the rich "Harvard Hottie" who lives on the 12th floor of the apartment building.
It turns out that the Mrs. X is in a bad marriage which has left the Mrs. desperate for her workaholic husband's attentions while ignoring her son.
Chris Evans colorlessly plays Harvard Hottie, Annie's preppy, kind-hearted suitor upstairs, while Nicholas Art simply doesn't register any real warmth as Grayer.
It is uncomfortable watching a character who is so out of her depth, while the Nanny in the book grew up in that society, yet could still see the ridiculousness of it.
Even though the X's and nanny comes to make you tired while reading, that would have allowed an excellent adaptation: shorter but consistent with the humor of the book.
In the novel, NAN (presumably short for Nancy) becomes a PART-TIME nanny while she's finishing a graduate degree -- she's not a live-in.
In the book, NAN's parents and even grandparents are entirely aware of her part-time babysitting gig, it's no secret, and it's no more "degrading" than someone who works at the Gap while trying to finish college.
Donna Murphy has a thankless role as the controlling Jersey mom -- a working class nurse who is "horrified" to see her college age daughter doing child care, a distinction that makes no sense (who watched Annie while her single mom was working as a nurse?
It's not a surprise that this film was held back from release for a long while (probably reworked a lot, to no good effect).
A man, while having a sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, gets bitten by a werewolf, and his gf gets torn to shreds (yes, you've guessed it, she was in mid-orgasm when the beast attacked).
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
He passes photographs to the jury while the judge is considering whether they are admissible, and gives long soliloquies about surprise witnesses who are "prepared to testify", all while the prosecutor sits mute.
It's not worth the $2.99 at Blockbuster, but if you come across it on FX or something, it might be worth your while to flip between it and "The Jeffersons."
The two main characters remind me of a show I once saw a while back, oh yeah, it was called X-Files.
The worst part of this whole show is that they waste 200 hours of your life just to lead into episode six which is supposed to tie in all the clues from 1-5 together and while they do, its very clumsily done.
I stumbled onto this while trying to find something that was similar to other shows that I do like, such as Carnivale, which is also an apocalyptic tale with overt religious content.
I admit that sometimes one's mood while watching a movie can affect one's opinion of that movie.
I accept that "Toy Story 2" (which I also rated as "poor") may not have been as bad as I said it was, considering that I was in a very bad mood while watching it and didn't really want to be there.
We learned, for example, that they had taken human form and had to remain in that form while on Earth or they would die.
Oh, and whats with the "black Jew" having what looked like an acid trip while praying in the garden.
The plot (about four students and a professor who conquer their sexual fears while lucid dreaming but--surprise!--meet a mysterious devil-woman in their dreams and must team up to defeat her) is intriguing in the let's-slow-down-and-look-at-the-overturned-tractor-trailer sort of way.
Some have compared it to the 'Carry On' movies and, while there is a superficial resemblance to the worst of them, this series outstrips 'em all by a country mile for sheer unfunniness.
And I don't mean that in a 'This isn't a film for wimps, while Love Camp 7 is' kind of way.
The scenes showing the experiments, while certainly tasteless, are often more strange than anything else.
The repulsiveness is limited to a few sequences (a girl gets both boiled an iced in a water tank, another one is hung bleeding by her feet) while the rest is of the film talkative dullness about the superiority of the Third Reich etc etc...
This includes a narcotics agent, 2 members of the gang, and an elevator runner, who stupidly announces that she can get her face in the papers for identifying the killers of a gang member while riding in her elevator.
It's not as brutal, aggressive and intense, while the adrenaline levels are very meek and it lacks that rough edge.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
There's almost no gore or suspense, even the bits that should be exciting never really pay off in a worth while way, and the few good ideas in the movie (traps and some cool locations) are pretty much squandered.
I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful "Showgirls," which I've never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare.
Highlight of the movie: you get to half see some chicks boobs while captor guy whacks off.
A group of international students (in reality organized supporters of anti-government rebels) is massacred in Colombia by Federales as action opens, while during alternating scenes Joe Wiley (Ryan O'Neal), an American electronics engineer, visiting Mexico to recover from a divorce, meets an affluent socialite, Lillian Holbrook (Anne Archer).
Basically while exploring the kingdom with Timon (Nathan Lane, again) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella, again) she meets Kovu, a lion from the bad part of the kingdom.
However, while there are fairy godmothers, she gets a series of "Christmas Elves" to help out... so to speak.
It has the typical plot of a family juggling work, health, and relationship concerns while a fierce hail storm named "Medusa" rolls through town.
There is no atmosphere, scares or tension & while I accept some people may like this black and white art-house nonsense I don't & that's all that matters to me, I simply cannot see how anyone could gain any sort of viewing pleasure from such a film as this & I certainly didn't.
I've nothing against art house horror , I thought THE ADDICTION was okay while I loved the visual style of THE KEEP but there has to be a limit and NADJA goes way beyond that limit and ends up unwatchable for those of us who aren't obsessed with pretentious nonsense   The story follows eponymous vampire Nadja who steps foot in America in a bizarre remake of DRACULA'S DAUGHTER .
We start the movie off with a midget pimp in a top hat and coattails digging a hole while laughing maniacally....that was about the only good thing about the whole movie for I watched this sober and nearly fell asleep.
Karloff does nothing of any great importance in here and the characters are all flat and tiring to look at after a while.
Her two dance sequences are the only thing that will keep you awake while trying to finish off this turkey.
Much of the movie shows them cloistered in the Stanfield household, eating food and watching TV while their prisoners wander around more or less undisturbed and certainly not imprisoned.
This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut about a bank executive whose family is held hostage while he is forced to assist the kidnappers in robbing the bank.
It really should include a shot of Harrison Ford taking a dump... while wearing a suit.
Yes, these evil thugs would give a peanut butter cookie to a peanut allergic boy but they are not so heartless as to leave the family pet behind while abducting the family cross country!
As someone with an interest in computers, I was looking forward to the release of this movie for quite a while.
A couple of other points - Mae Marsh's performance is semi-decent although there appears to be a bit too much over-dramatisation at points while Constance Talmadge's character (the Babylonian Mountain Girl) although sometimes implausible is a nice humorous insertion (I used to know a girl like that!).
If you are looking for something different, something that will make you think while you laugh and think about why you are laughing, this movie is worth taking a look at.
And like the rest of us I dont like to lower my standerds once a a while for pop-corn movies that arent very good but still have some entertainment value.
Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat.
Special FX weren't THAT bad for most of the movie but the end fight scene graphics were the worst I've seen in a while.
Directed with an admirable lack of taste and restraint by Andrea Bianchi (the same sweet, subtle, sophisticated gent who blessed us with the insanely gory and over-the-top zombie gut-cruncher "Burial Ground"), who pours on the gratuitous nudity and explicit violence with cheerfully crass abandon (the kill scenes are quite vicious and gruesome while the generously well-proportioned Femi Benussi in particular offers the viewers an amazingly ample eyeful sans clothes).
A cop sleeps with a councilor while she leaves the kids at home.
All while being painfully aware of their own level of incredible cheese.
Nor one of those shows about how the evil alien which is about to kill everyone in the world and suddenly learns to love us because some w****r scientist kisses some gal in the heat of the moment, and leaves despite the fact that it's been shot full of holes by missles and been exposed to nothing but a constant stream of violence from the majority of the "dominant" human population (remember, we are great, while dinosaurs sucked!).
And the military sent along to keep the Chinese away from the thing while they guard the scientific probing, and eventually ordered to destroy it, are simply interchangable, unthinking, faceless toy soldiers, incapable of independent thought.
If you want to see a movie where - the main charachters are flatter than a table - the background charachters are just "background", no emotions, except for some chinese extras that while pretending to be menacing smile at the camera!
The acting, while occasionally good, is often terrible.
But while I really liked the DIC care bears I did not like this at all.
At the end of the novel, Miss Marple declares, while "looking as fierce as an old lady can" that if anyone should hang, it is he!
), then he hooks up with Edwige, seemingly immediately moving in to her apartment, moaning about his coffee, and reading the paper while ignoring her.
All in all, good movie to throw on in the background while you're cleaning out your laptop files.
Meyer looks great in black leather and shooting two guns at a time a la Tomb Raider Lara Croft while Munro simply looks like an idiot in an Indiana Jones hat about two sizes too big for his head.
Thor is mostly absent from the film as he's off on some personal quest of his own that keeps him separated from the other heroes until the climax, while Bruce Banner/Hulk spends most of the feature incarcerated for the destruction he caused before.
The first Ultimate Avengers, while not perfect, was still a solid introduction to the characters, their dynamics and their personal issues.
Now, there are unexpected pleasures to be wrought from watching obscure movies now and then, and while I generally am pretty resistant to the 'oh wow, I've been there' effect, I did find the 1972 vintage shots of 'Place Jacques Cartier' and 'Rue St. Paul Est', well before the resurrection of the area as "Old Montreal' to be such a surprise.
But, the pace of the film is plodding, the performances detached and completely unengaging (or maybe the characters are detached and completely unengaging; in any case, you don't sympathize with them), the direction too "arty" (for example, a driving scene with no dialogue runs about five minutes, while one of Karen Black's "melancholy" songs plays on the soundtrack).
The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night.
This they figure out while bugs get zapped while trying to get into a silo!
None of that deterred me, however, as while I admit that this isn't the greatest Giallo...I really, really enjoyed watching it.
The premise, while fantastic, could have been much better executed.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
And while Graham Linehan's sentimental sitcom leanings roped in his surrealist writing partner, Arthur Mathews, to make Father Ted a genuine classic, without Mathews, Linehan is free to indulge in the sub-FRIENDS/Seinfeld sitcom he was always in danger of making.
Expect many scenes where Jen laments her life while Roy plays video games.
Unfortunately, while it boasts a great premise and it's got some interesting bits here and there, it ultimately failed to satisfy on many levels.
It would take a while to catalogue all the flaws in this movie, but I'll try to hit the basic points.
Things start to go wrong, however, when, on the return journey, their spacecraft burns up while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
Then he continues to act like a jerk while attempting to cover up whatever misdeeds he previously took part in.
Too bad this show degrades his weight every week while going after the lowest common denominator
Elliot while a Mediterranean man and a gorgeous blonde Scot are sitting on the bed, paying more attention to this pixie like artistic woman than the story that she reads?
Film companies should have learned then that while Bill and Ted were once good, and always will be, MORE of the same kind is tiring.
One day Stew and Phil are hanging beneath a balloon being towed above the Hawaiian surf, while being pursued by a truant officer on a Jet Ski.
", and while the lousiness of it is much on the same level as "Meet the Deedles," its watchability (yes, I made up that word) differs.
The plot has more holes than the holiest Swiss-cheese on earth and involves government conspiracies and comes across in some respects as a low grade Bourne movie (Snipes plays a guy hunted down by spooks while his mind is fried to s**t) it even has a supporting role in it for Adewale Agbaje who was in Bourne Identity.
The drugged "hero", with cloudy vision, kills the men in the helicopter with precise shoots, while the place is surrounded by FBI agents that do nothing.
Putting a toddler in a trash can while they wreck the stroller.
You'd think these 'youth gone wild' would have gotten bored with this after a while, and so they do.
Grant, while not overacting, was pretty much a cipher--giving an amazingly muted and uninspiring performance.
Also, while the other songs weren't sleazy like this one, they did seem to portray the actors and actresses as happy little children.
The film is fun and funny for a while, but becomes incredibly tedious by the end.
The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable.
The actors are pleasant in appearance, C-level in terms of material and performances, and while the subject matter is not unimportant, the way it is presented here is.
Someone put together a script while on a potty break.
I really used to think Cave Dwellers was pretty crappy, but Outlaw of Gor makes me wish Ator could skewer Cabot while Thong pummels Watney Smith into submission.
When you have untalented amateurs doing the job then this is what you will end up with - a pointless dreary mess that will make you YAWN while your ears are bleeding.
Actors are suppose to scare innocent victims while being filmed by hidden cameras.
Mila Kunis, while pleasant, is a flyweight made-for TV actress and this stinker does nothing to expand that role.
And while there seems to be an attempt at sending up campus life and politics, it is not a redeeming factor at all and the writers appear to give up on it after not too long.
* and while we're talking about magic guns, and why would Navy personnel, on their way to Mardi Gras, just happen to be wearing full combat gear and toting M-15s?
Some movies have a reputation of being so bad that they're fun to watch once in a while.
One absolutely ridiculous scene consists of two guys lying on a double bed in a suburban bedroom, dressed in their combat fatigues, firing their machine guns while asleep.
In the first scene, Cameron Smith has a red-hot metal rod pressed against his bare chest while he's tied between two posts, and in the second, Brian O'Connor -- tied between two trees -- has strips of barb-wire tightened around his naked torso.
The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.
Well... at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery.
So while watching the movie it may appear that Goldwyn had to make do with the likes of Phil Baker and the Ritz Brothers, but in fact he had other available resources which he foolishly chose to employ.
Next, The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals, which, in-turn, all end-up going into cardiac arrest, and dying.
She walks in to see sweet, wholesome Kenny Baker cooking hamburgers while singing "Love Walked In" (with a full orchestra being heard).
And while I agree it is really bad, I'm not sure it reached the level of wretchedness needed to merit inclusion in the book--but it sure is close enough that I can't fault its mention.
After all, in some segments, there is opera, while in others it's Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy, in another it's ballet or modern dance, and in others it's the incredibly unfunny antics of the Ritz Brothers.
The horrible ballet sequence about Romeo and Juliet with a happy ending and danced by half of the company tap dancing, while the rest are in tutus and toe shoes, is not to be believed, even if the creator was George Ballanchine, himself.
Kenny Baker singing "Love Walked In" while frying hamburgers is laughable, at best.
Every once in a while one Tom-Tom the Piper's Son or Little Bo-Peep burst into song.
Two used car lot owners, who we know nothing about, get involved with numerous shady characters, who we know nothing about, while being paid to watch a Pontiac convertible, which we know nothing about.
I watched it 3 times and I found much of the dialog to be hard to decipher and there were long passages of very boring scenes { like the dancing scenes while the card playing was going on } .
This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played, so that we don't take the movie too seriously.
Throughout this film "Josh" never quite appreciates the jokes; while "Pax" never finds the peace that comes from exorcising one's own demons---he just cuts his vacation short, so to speak.
And while this is described as horror, it really should be classified as thriller.
For example, while at a sex club (wow, original!)
The nearly hour-long "intro" is spent observing the backpackers while they party, get high and watch naked ladies in Amsterdams Red Light-district.
If you can get past the middle 20 minutes or so while they explain what the team can do, you're in for a great ride.
I really tried to be objective while watching it, heck, I tried to hard to not change the channel and put on some MTV in the worst case scenario.
Every once in a while, a movie on the video store shelf catches your eye.
Seriously, I could hardly stay awake while watching it, and I have never fallen asleep in class.
It has been quite a while since I have seen a film that was this beautifully crafted and nearly flawless.
What was unbelievable to me is when Meg Ryan leaves the house while newly human Nicholas Cage is in the shower just to get a peach or pear or whatever fruit it was.
He wanders around barefoot in the rain for a while until a guy takes him to Tahoe.
The remake may employ better-known actors, but it adds nothing of merit while stripping away most of the original's emotional depth.
The camera-work and pacing is static and primitive even by 1914 standards while the performers are quite the opposite, both of which can get annoying and boring.
We get poor framing, from a generally stationary position, and the shots linger on much longer than they should, while the performers, except for the literally cold-hearted princess, are in constant motion, mostly broadly gesticulating and doing some knockabout nonsense.
Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony.
Vardalos' track is charming but marred by long pauses since she seems to miss someone prompting her to speak, while Petrie's is understandably more technical in nature.
Then these killers, generally speaking, develop a bond with these girls they abduct and do not kill while providing them everything so that they can break free and run, at times taking a hell of a beating at their hands yet doesn't kill.
A while later, someone named Clay sets off on his motorbike to look for his sister (who was one of the kids from the start) and he meets some other kids who are there to be slaughtered.
while putting in a lesbian scene and then getting sodomized by her now-assertive "protege".
Taija Rae is the (chubby) sweet girl next door (who will do double(you-know-what)), while Joey, Gerry, and Ron raise hell and remind you of why the porn industry is not what it's cracked up to be.
The original "Friday the 13th" dealt with a mom gone amok over the drowning death of her son while teenage counselors who were supposed to be watching him indulged in sex.
As in previous renditions, there are a couple of sympathetic characters added for audience appeal while Jason murders the other repulsive young twits one by one.
And while the 1980s Friday films aren't what I'd call genre classics, you could at least clearly make out the gory scenes instead of getting a split flash of some CGI effect while the cameraman goes into a seizure.
Naturally all the white characters get to pair off and have sex, while no one seems the least bit interested in the one black and one Asian character.
Since the black guy can't get laid he's reduced to pleasuring himself while listening to whitey going at it upstairs.
The original has that legendary moment that made people jump from their seats while the people who made this botched that opportunity because of a completely awful editing cut.
They were counting their money while that cult icon drowned.
Even though 'The 9th Gate' was not the right adaptation from the 'El club Dumas', from the same author, Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte, it is a good film, making the fans of a good thriller eager for a much better work in what concerns 'LA TABLA DE FlANDES', stating yet that it's very easy not to drift from the book, while make a new movie...
Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive.
I'm writing this while watching it and i have to say, SWEET Jesus!
There's the obligatory love interest (Leonor Varela, whose character's name we also don't know for a while), the Crazy Wise Man, The Sexy Spy, The Comic Relief Who Adds Nothing To The Plot, The Tough Soldier, and The Horrible Dialogue.
Their interest is, however, scientific, except for the legionnaire buddy who is more interested in gold statuettes accidentally getting lost in his greatcoat pockets (Having mentioned the legionnaire, I must say that I admire the courage of the scriptwriter, who reveals to us -for the very first time- that Egypt was at the time a French protectorate, and not, as we've been led to believe by the official history, associated to the British empire)  The bad guys stick to the old, slow, boring system of studying the terrain and excavating carefully according to old Ieroglyphs, while our hero and his friends discover the tomb the legendary grave by happily throwing dynamite sticks at random: a new path is opened thus for archeology.
At the end his son goes to jail and his wife gets shot and killed, while Lowes character seems to be placed into an asylum.
The truth is that one's potential is limited and wages for blue collar workers in Singapore is very low while the cost of living is high.
I have read some other reviews that speak highly of the comedy in this film while do speak similarly of the lacking story, but for me everything was broken.
Besides the great performances by the two leads, portraying antagonists with similar world-views while on different sides of the law, I especially liked the permeating atmosphere of Japan that came through with the cinematography, the soundtrack, and the scene set-ups.
Acting wise: Molly Shannon is the only actor who does her part well, while all the others try hard, though some manage.
She, with the freckles and page-boy hair cut, is a workaholic, steadfast and incorruptible in her duties (You can sort of understand why many people evade their taxes while watching this film.).
After a while, I knew what the lizard was thinking, because my ears were damn sore from this constantly, corny hollowing.
The special effects hardly help the matter; while again, hardly as laughably atrocious as they could be, never once create a convincing impression of the lizard actually being 50 feet long, alternating between shots of a life sized reptile hissing its way through underbrush (with twigs poorly substituting for tree trunks) and an enormous foot closing down upon its prey.
Lowest point of the film is when one of the town's leading idiots tries to sing a stupid song while pathetically twanging a ukulele, first for a crippled little girl, then for a group of moronic teenagers.
This movie was clearly trying to capitalize off all the teen trends of the late 50's---kids and their hot rod cars and their music,Elvis was mentioned, and all that.Chase is a good wholesome teen who is helping his single mom raise his crippled little sister.This cool cat is also trying to get a singing career off the ground.Anyway there is some singing and some DJ comes to town for a dance party and all the while this giant Gila monster is walking around.
Some directors can tell an interesting story in the usual 90 minutes, while Andrew Bujalski spends 110 minutes to tell you ... nothing.
Mutual Appreciation is part of an ever increasing breed of film which attempts to emulate the style of "art films" from the 1960s and 1970s while simultaneously trying to be modern and cutting edge.
As it is, watching it is more history than enjoyment, while the novel still holds up as well written detective fiction.
The constant jazz-type beat on the main song was cool for quite a while but got tiresome toward the end.
Somehow, within 2 days these two wind up in bed together and commiserate in their sins while the audience thinks about how they wish they hadn't canceled that root canal they had scheduled.
His sister's husband had a mysterious stroke while jogging and Ed studied Pharmacy in College.
The zombies stumble upon  Mark and Janet, and James and Leslie, while they are all getting it  on in the gardens.
I nearly stopped watching this horrible movie several times while watching it.
She plots her escape while having an affair with a married doctor.
Although I don't like "dumb" humor I'm glad I stumbled into this one while channel surfing.
And while "Shallow Hal" won't go down as a classic, it was certainly better than "Stuck On You" - which, quite simply, it shouldn't have been.
And while there are glimpses of excellent comedy writing, it seems obvious the writer couldn't come up with enough of them to fill out a movie and reverted to standard, clichÃ©'d comedy bits to fill the rest.
It's fine to point out any connection the Republicans had to Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president.
In exchange for a few politically incorrect venial sins, Mr. Solas delivers the neo-official party line, where only Cubans on the island know who they really are (despite "everything"), while Miami Cubans have to marry an American to get any respect.
S.S. Wilson handles the directing reins for this movie, and while he doesn't match the incredible job Ron Underwood did, he still does a solid job behind the camera.
The screenplay, while sometimes clever, doesn't necessarily have a lot in the way of imagination, and sometimes it almost feels like the movie is just going through the moitions, but thankfully, that's not quite the case in the last 35 or so minutes.
Yet, Sa'Luk takes a while to change.
**SPOILERS** Pros: Hot actresses (Sarah Chalke looks in this), nice looking campus that actually look well-kept, and... uh lemme think, Oh yeah A good flick to make fun of while plastered with friends.
Louise Delamere (Ally Sheedy) is a motivational speaker and former pro golfer and while jogging one day is savagely attacked and beaten by an unknown assailant and her girlfriend Alex (Patsy Kensit) is the one that urged her to take time off and heal.
This is a kind of "morality play," featuring a young albino man who has superhuman intellect and psychic powers ostensibly due to his mother having been killed by lightning while he was still in utero.
Even though mom arrived minutes after the tornado hit (and had to evade a police roadblock to do so) the daughter -- who had, by the way, ignored an earlier cellphone message from weather-guru mom warning of the impending twister -- tears a strip off mom, apparently for not being there with her while the school was being torn apart ("Where were you?
I'm a Pink Panther fan and like any devoted fan I try to watch every Panther movie, but this was not worth while.
The conversation the two leads have (while in bed, the whole film happens in a motel room) sounds a bit forced at times, and is quite dull.
I don't get why it was shot that way, it makes us miss any looks of delight they might give each other while playing and being childish, and it makes it hard for the audience to connect, care, and feel what the characters are going through.
This film with some clips featuring Peter Sellers were from deleted scenes together with a lame plot to suggested that the incompetent French detective Inspector Clouseau had disappeared in mysterious circumstances while Joanna Lumley played a journalist in search for an answer using as-filmed footages together with much of the Peter Sellers scenes actually coming from The Pink Panther Strikes Again.
The second half, while more coherent and linearly plotted, lacks Peter Sellers - and - really - just isn't very funny.
A film like this is going to have a least a couple obligatory scenes: One, play a romantic song while one actor turns to look at the other just as the other is turning away.
And two, play an upbeat song for the girl to dance provocatively to so she can show us how adorable and how much fun she is while the guy shows how much fun he is by showing us how much he enjoys her.
But then it gets decidedly ridiculous, and after a while you feel very cheated - Edwards has booked bums on seats in theatres without giving us any kind of movie at all.
For a little while, it almost works (the joins are at times seamless) despite itself.
It's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while.
Sex is trivial, while reaching each other's inner thoughts, feelings and truths is the unexpected, obtrusive and life altering act.
For one, the film's audience must accept that adopting a child or inseminating a young wife are less harmonious actions to a newlywed's continued happy home life than the notion of pushing a husband (who truly does not desire to remarry) to marry an additional wife for breeding purposes with the resulting children being emotionally commandeered by the first wife while the biological mother (second wife) still lives on in the home with no deep attachment to either children or husband.

Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose).
The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters.
As some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while there`s other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order .
In "Before Sunrise," hormones and the idea of anonymous sex is certainly not the primary force that brings the couple together while beautiful, classical Vienna shines magically around them creating an ideal romance - that once in a lifetime opportunity that brings you the love of your life, seize it or you'll live to regret it.
And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.
He spends the entire film topless while the visiting females of the area gawk at the stud.
Patty Duke, and even Melissa Gilbert had a more wild animal like energy to their performances, while Ms. Pepsi seems bored as Helen (or is it that we are just bored at watching her?
The original two Hellraiser films are absolute classics, and while I quite liked the boisterous third part - I'd really rather they stopped making sequels after Hellbound.
(Brooks makes the poor woman drip snot from her nose for the last twenty minutes of the film, while the heavenly, marmoreal Vega consummates a sweetly platonic love affair with Sandler.)
The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity.
She changes law so that Sandler's character can marry her mother while still married to his own wife.
The acting was average at best, but a really poor performance by the daughter of Adam Sandler's character (sometimes you can see her trying to cover up a smile while getting angry).
Now, obviously, Helen has aged 53 years, while Capt.
All you would have to do is change the designation of the religion being bashed in an unfunny, bigoted and mean spirited fashion (all the while accusing bashed religion of being bigoted and mean spirited).
So, let's not kid ourselves, some iconoclasts are only safe iconoclasts, going down well worn roads of supposed "envelope pushing" while the envelope has already been broken for some time.
The type that feels entitled not only to jab at deeply held beliefs of a group of largely decent people but to totally stomp on them while slurring those people.
He didn't look like he wanted to win, even missing an opportunity of going through the door while Warrior was tangling with Heenan.
After a while you begin to wander what else they're going to throw in the mix.
Maybe the small insert of real music by Gene Rodgers is enough to search for that scene (about 9:40 in), where he plays a nice stride or similar style piano, though probably not miked while filming, since the fingerwork doesn't match up.
Heather Graham (who's accent also slips out - when it should be her tits)is gratingly out of place as a prostitute her colleagues all look like hags while she looks like a model.
Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience.
Marilyn Burns makes for a fetching and pitiable luckless damsel-in-distress as Sally while Paul A. Partain contributes a memorably obnoxious performance as the extremely whiny, hateful and unsympathetic cripple Franklin.
There are some nice Gore effects in the werewolf victims, but it's never on a 'Braindead' level, so it always looks realistic, while Bridgets transformation is as great as Gingers in the first 1, kinda reminding of The Fly, not the original but the gory remake.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
I have watched this movie and in the first 10 minutes Nina(the lead actress) utters "KALI F*****G Maa" about an Indian Goddess..hows that justified..no1 can address a goddess like that..and most of all not an ABCD like Nina..  Have had no idea what Mr.Krutin Patel had in mind while adding that part to the screen play..
Or when the kids are trying to sneak past the moronic inventor, the girl has a fantastic idea of disguising his son as a female.. by slipping a two piece swimming costume on him (while neglecting to do anything about his appearance).
This definitely freaked me out while watching it.
I can't believe the actors actually could keep a straight face while quoting their lines.
To me it was a major snooze fest and I keep looking for something else while I watched it.
I gave it 1 star because:   1) there wasn't anything lower available to give it here other than 0 stars, and it ain't getting off that easy, and   2) I did enjoy some of the music in the movie (when it wasn't trying to sound 'comical' when the twin vampires were doing whatever the heck it is they're doing while the cameras were rolling... it sure wasn't anything funny, that's for sure.)
Everyone to their own tastes, but I found nothing to get excited about ( and nothing entertaining) while I was watching KCET's "Saturday Night Movie", and Martin Sheen promised me I'd see a hilarious film - I'm still waiting to laugh.
The witty banter turns your stomach after a while.
What was he doing while all this was going on?
See the women lean against fences, crouch next to streams and play board games while they talk about their interpersonal relationships!
There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening.
Her character was zany and unique while her vulnerability was easy to relate to.
This gets quite annoying after a while.
Tobe Hooper continued making good horror during the 70 ( Eaten Alive ) and in the early 80's he even was a star for a little while !
These dopes crash in the jungle while looking for this girl, because there's a reward for finding her.
But the thing that always gives me the creeps when I watch TCM is the scene at the beginning, when they drive by the cattle ranch and we see the poor animals while Franklin talks about how they are killed and everything.
In the end though, very predictable, Ryan and Jennifer end up on the Italy plane together, and they do accept they love each other, while Hunter (in a small subplot) finds his perfect girl with Jennifer's friend Amy (Final Destination's Amanda Detmer).
It took me a fair while to press down on that chunky silver 'play' button, recollecting the stories I'd heard about the film.
Even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy Franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out "Yeah, see you in an hour or so" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he's never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds.
The chase scene where Leatherface hunts down Marilyn Burns, scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal, is shot through branches of trees, as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death.
They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings.
Kirk decides to ask the residents for some gas, while Pam waits on the front steps.
As the character has been developed by other script writers, we have come to realize that he, after a while, does not blame himself completely for all these deaths.
Further batman plays with the guy by beating him up, oops cause thats how batman always operated, by feeding his ego and beating up some worthless junkie while the Joker is on the loose.
At first, with such horrendous acting and Bats getting crotch-zapped (while wearing a rubber suit?)
It was not until a few years ago while reading Chuck Yeager's autobiography that I learned he did some of the flying at the behest of the Air Force.
Return to an earlier time while viewing this comedy-that-never-was, and please don't expect to walk away with a moral, or inspired.
After a while he's got the hots for her so bad, he marries her and they go back to the USSR to see what he can find out about their aircraft.
And his "run" while chasing the car!
The rest of the police force thinks he's crazy, while the alien continues sampling the Italian cuisine of New York City This movie is so Cheese movies, if you do like cheesy movies this is cheesy at it best.
I hate it when all I can think of while watching any movie is: "when will it end?"
It wasn't funny at all, it just got tiring after a while.
After a while, the DNA test comes up.
but recently I caught some new episodes while channel surfing.
No matter the topic Maury comes across as someone who is pretending to care but he is really doing nothing to improve the situation while profiting on the problems of these dysfunctional people.
It is a show that pretends to help people (like Steve Wilkos) while really exploiting their problems and making it into a circus (like Jerry).
If the man is NOT the father, then the man gets up and begins dancing, while the woman has tears in her eyes and sprints backstage with Maury, the man, and the skank girlfriend close on her heels.
She collapses on the 'sobbing couch' backstage while Maury promises to find her baby daddy and the man and the new skank girlfriend are teaming up to yell and scream at her.
I'd try it for a while, and then go back to channel hopping.
Almost at the very beginning of the 1960 film, we see the professor (George Sanders) drop unconscious to the floor while speaking on the phone.
Another man, struck unconscious while driving, has his pickup roll off the road and collide with an object.
It's based on S. L. A. Marshall's book of the same name, which focused, as does the film, on small-scale operations while not ignoring the larger picture.
Guardino's friend is killed and Peck has to drag him away from the body, while he screams, "He was my BUDDY."
I'm a huge fan of Whoopi and have seen all of her 80's action/comedy films and while this isn't as bad as Fatal Beauty.
Trouble is that while Whoopi is in the house, the ex returns and is soon murdered.
And not to mention star Gregory Peck, who plays a courtly leader struggling to maintain his composure while watching good men die for what both he and they realize is a big fat nothing.
One of Whoopi Goldberg's many post-"Color Purple" blunders, a half-comic/half-serious rendering of Lawrence Block's series of stories about a cat burglar who witnesses a murder while robbing a house.
An excellent point is that the movie begins and ends in the middle, so while the plot is interesting to look at, it is completely secondary to the message being conveyed by the animators.
Darkside Blues begins in a state of confusion and while you expect an answer, it ends in exactly the same point.
Movies like Pork Chop Hill, while not a masterpiece, sometimes emerge from obscurity as a singular reminder of forgotten sacrifice.
People not familiar with Susan Cooper's "Dark is Rising" cycle will find this simply another lackluster and occasionally bewildering teen fantasy film, while anyone who read and enjoyed Cooper's books would be well-advised to steer clear of the film altogether: it will simply make them angry.
Attempts at characterization include a black guy who dies first and a sexy/tough lesbian who masturbates while watching another couple have kinky sex through one-way glass.
I had the misfortune of watching this movie while I was serving a mission for the LDS Church.
right away we see the main chick with a jacket on with nothing on under it while she was at work.
It was right there in the previous scene, but for a while it is gone.
But the movie is just ultimately boring and slow, and while it's not the worst of some of the crocodile flicks I've seen (*cough* Crocodile), it's not the best and it is far from the best - but actually not as bad as people are saying to the extent of getting so many 1 votes.
I should make very clear that while this film is clearly derivative of Blade Runner, it is nowhere near the feast for the eyes that the former is, and it also fails miserably at putting its own unique visual spin on the future.
I like this movie and while it lacks the realistic and detailed gore of modern war films, and it does have its glitches and goofs, it did not do a bad job for a 1959 production.The attention to detail given to King Company's organizational structure, and many other technical aspects of the platoon and company level combat operation portrayed was outstanding thanks to Captain Joseph G. Clemons Jr., the movies' technical director and actual commander of King Company during the battle.
While dragon ball and dragon ball z are two of the best animes ever created the pitiful ending that it was given doesn't do it any justice.Dragon Ball GT was clearly poorly written while it was some what entertaining it is a utter disgrace to previous dragon ball sagas.The fact that is was canceled was shame enough.The creators should have just ended it with Dragon Ball Z as the original plan was.Another thing,Goku in his super saiyan 4 form is as cocky as Vegeta since when Goku has the cockiness of Vegeta.All he is babbling about is what he is capable of when really there doesn't seem to be much strength in that form.Its Super Saiyan 4 for God sakes at Super Saiyan level 1 he seemed to had more power.How the hell you could get trashed so much at level 4?Very disappointed in this stupid end to a brilliant anime saga.
I bet no one has ever compared K-9 and Company to Apocalypse Now, but while I was watching it I couldn't help thinking of a quote from that picture: "The horror, the horror..."
There were also several instances of foreboding-the wife telling the nanny that she won't be back for a while and when the dog breaks free and swims to the boat as if to save the wife.
As far as these "true death" documentaries go, I've seen a few of the "Faces of Death" films and one of those "Death Scenes" tapes a while back, but I can't say I am really "into" these.
Not to mention at least an intriguing plot (with all of the political possibilities) of teens abandoned in a post apocalyptic setting where they form feuding factions as they seek to rebuild, one struggling to build its power while the other struggles for a peaceful existence (not to mention, a somewhat failure of modernity), and interesting sociological study for sure in the development of power and governance.
I watch many bad movies each year, but every once in a while, I come across a film that is without a single redeeming quality.
Plus there added another subplot of the evil Om Puri and his family especially Suresh Menon which makes the film boring  Too many cooks spoil the broth  Luckily the comic scenes between Akshay, Paresh make you laugh Second half gets nice but too lengthy The entire climax is so lengthy and uninviting, like a 70's climax The choosing of the right guy too is prolonged and boring  Vikram Bhatt does a good job in some comic scenes Music(Anu Malik) is good   Akshay steals the show and owns the film, He is the real star though now he has come a long way as an actor Suneil Shetty overdoes the limp bit but does well in some scenes Paresh Rawal is boring and too loud Shahid Kapur is boring in the lead, while Rimii Sen is pure teakwood with a dubbed voice Johny Lever is loud as usual Vijay Raaz is hilarious, Om Puri hams Suresh Menon irritates Asrani is alright
The (young) daughter subplot was good because both characters were somewhat likable while the scientists father daughter subplot reeked--I hated the scientist daughter.
There are other things going on in this nut house as well that include orderlies wearing shrunken-head masks while they rape the female patients - Remember those machines that would dry out a carved apple to make a prunie little head with a face on it?
Still, the scenes of Melissa tied up and screaming while surrounded by mutilated bodies just about makes up for it.
What I don't get is the fact that the script then has the cast sitting around whining, BSing, cracking jokes, whispering sweet nothings, while the clock counts down toward the end of the world.
Then there is a race against time to place the nukes and detonate them while dealing with stock villains, irrelevant and contrived side-stories about family squabbles, impossible coincidences, and implausible crises.
The grief-stricken Hunt sets out to capture and kill Rudy, but Rudy outsmarts him and hijacks Jed and his family while the protagonist is making small repairs to his 1979 motor home.
Let's put it this way: I picked up the phone and made an appointment with my dentist while watching this movie.
the horrible plot: a country boy working at a gas station starts working for a puppet master while Toulon(the puppet master) plans to turn the boy into a puppet.
Another thing is while Magrew makes Robert carve a puppet out of wood the puppet Magrew uses at the end is actually made out of metal is some awful looking tank like creation with a couple laser guns for arms.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high.
It's ironic that the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was intended as an abolitionist work, and indeed did arouse sympathy for Blacks, (so much so that President Lincoln called its author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, "The little lady who started the Civil War") while this movie, in which Uncle Tom's Cabin plays a prominent part, is, by enlightened standards, crudely racist.
All the while Harry is trying to extricate himself from an arms deal gone very, very wrong.
There's a lot of pieces here that sound great--Bogart as Harry Smih, an arms merchant in Damascus--Everett Sloan as the French commandant--Lee J. Cobb as the French officer who's trying to bring peace while losing his woman to Bogart--catacombs, mysterious events--but it never comes together.
Hey, we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while, but when you get into spurting wound overkill, it gets boring.
His plan worked and BLADE RUNNER hit in 82 while MUTANT HUNT's legacy was muted because it was seen a ripoff.
The direction is the big failure in this movie, because the script and the acting, while they weren't good, they could have been fixed by a competent director.
There is no strategy while approaching to the enemy, all the time you are just shooting at them.
"Un Crabe dans la tete" focuses on Alex, a handsome but selfish underwater photographer who undergoes a number of emotional, life-changing experiences while passing through Montreal.
Overall though, while it might be worth a watch once either on TV or at a friend's (when they've rented it), it's not one that I would generally recommend.
Unfortunately for me I'm neither very interested nor entirely ignorant and so while I'm very glad to have witnessed this grand-scale piece of master craftsmanship it couldn't completely peak my interest.
At that point I started slightly cocking my head like a confused puppy while watching.
Hey Lion's Gate, I want my money back, and how about paying royalties to John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Rob Zombie while you're at it?
Meanwhile, the psychopath escapes from the asylum and while the group is inside the Dark Ride, they are chased and killed by the murderer.
Even though Bill warned a gal to watch out for the tracks (much later, at that), you could clearly see on the floor there weren't any, and while they went into other rooms there was no logic to the place, no real directional way that the tracks would be able to take a car around in them.
I have a suspicion that Lions Gate would have originally just released this as a DTV title, but since they were going to be involved releasing the After Dark titles, they forced Dark Ride into the bunch (notice how "A Lions Gate Film" was on the beginning of the credits, while basically the other After Dark titles didn't).
Those guys at the stock market, feasting on the spoils of the country while the proletariat slaved in the factories is brought to us with an incredible heavy-handedness.
I first saw and read the cover and it sounded promising.It was nothing like "Joy ride"(which is my favorite movie)or "I saw what you did last summer" like it implies.If i rented it instead of buying the bloody amateur movie i wouldn't be as mad.There was nothing interesting about it including the ending.If the movie had a bigger budget for better effects and better camera's and actors it might be OK.It did look promising up until they all got to the motel.After that it was lame and annoying.The characters were so aggravating that you wanted them to get killed off as quick as possible.The part I hated the most was when the 3 survivors had a man trapped at his home and tied up.They all screamed at him to shut up like a bunch of psycho's while he was pleading "you have it wrong it wasn't me".This Gawddamned scene made my blood boil it was so painfully annoying.
The Trip starts as eight college friends begin a trip from Los Angeles to Arizona for reasons which aren't important, up front in the sports car it's Carl (Larry Bagby) & his girlfriend Devan (Courtney Cole) along with Garry (Michael Chamberlain) & his stash of ecstasy that they plan on selling, then in the off roader it's Devan's sister Cess (Heather Shrake) along with Dana (Elizabeth Keller) & Darius (David Slocum) while in the piece of crap run down car it's Sylvia & Veronica (Cristal Gerrick).
The Dungeons & Dragons movie, while bad, at least had some redeeming scenes and characters.
And while seeing Harvey Keitel running around in the deserts of Australia wearing a little red dress is certainly entertaining, I really think that, at that point, the audience is laughing AT the film, not with it.
while up to my neck in raw faeces in the middle of a hot and humid African jungle than have to endure another viewing of this awful movie.
We're supposed to be amused when minor characters are interviewed on TV saying how strangely Pigeon acted -- after everyone assumes his wife is dead -- but he WAS acting strangely, so strangely that you wonder why no one reported him to the police while he was staying at the resort.
Joe could have kicked the fire out and saved the cards, enabling him to go back to 1985 and give back the one card to her, while still have plenty for himself.
They look pretty bored while they're sawing and hammering and whatnot.
while walking home, i had to stop every five seconds to look at the boxart and read the back and look at the tape, it took me an hour to walk 5 hundred feet when it usually takes me 20 minutes.
Casper Van Dien gives a sold, hard-working performance, while Jennifer McShane manages to sidestep as many clichÃ©s as she can and make palatable the ones she simply can't avoid hitting head-on.
He gets help by another expert, Corinne, who loves to run around in her bikini while trying to solve the case.
She then marries again, while still married to her first husband, to the grounds keeper, Clancy Brown.
At the end, after someone smashes her car back window, Rose has an epiphany and drives back home and while a long-dry spring gushes to life, Rose gushes about how she's now Cecilia's 'REAL mother!'
while hugging her daughter and bigamous husband.
But somehow, I don't think that making our "hero" out to be as unappealing and unsympathetic as possible, while putting him into completely implausible and unbelievable situations, advances the cause of Asian male de-stereotyping.
In a nutshell, while I feel that the movie is decent, it didn't blow me away and it's not something I'll really recommend to friends.
I took a certain delight in many of the scenes in the movie: the opening scene where the title character fights through Asian stereotypes while trying to audition for a commercial, the awe and wonder he feels seeing Shanghai for the first time, and his helplessness with the Chinese language as he tries to get back to his hotel.
For a while, this tongue-in-cheek spoof spy movie is fun enough: our bow-legged mini-Bond runs, jumps and kicks butt while the bad guys cower in fear of having their knackers bashed (the half-pint hero's trademark move); Mr.
Some of its films seem quite modern, while others seem very old.
Unfortunately, this film will only be preaching to the converted just as Beavis and Butthead also did in the same era, while sterile and boring masses take it at face value.
The further recursion was that the kids who took the show at face value were looking in the mirror while looking in the TV--sitting on their couch, looking dead ahead at B&B sitting on the couch.
I can only assume that the writers and execs at the studio were under the influence of some mind-altering drug while they were watching a re-run of a "Francis the Mule" film or else had loved ones kidnapped in order to force this film to be made.
I first saw this movie while I was living as an Italian immigrant in New Zeland at the age of 10 in 1998...it was a movie that sky cinema proposed,so as a child I couldn't miss the movie of a chimp that saved a Californian minor league team.
Here we are now in 2008,exactly 10 years after, while i'm searching strange movies on IMDb for a good laugh,that this ''movie'' appears to my memories again and a long chill goes through my spine.
I think the movie viewing public will be safe for a while from being tortured by another No Limit movie production considering almost everyone on the label is either facing some type of criminal charge or serving time for being found guilty on charges brought against them.
But instead it was used to record Master P's desire to employ all the awful rappers of New Orleans while keeping his unexplainable popularity as the poor man's Puff Daddy through the roof.
(END SPOILER)" Also, no one in this movie can act, especially Master P. All he ever does is stupid things in a Southern accent while flashing his gold teeth.
At times Cate Blanchett changed her phony drawl and driveled moronic script lines, while he uneducated Indian father sounded as if he held a PhD. "
When he awakens, Sarah has married another man, while his once-latent psychic powers come to flower.
Cronenberg made it look easy, while these filmmakers make it seem like an insurmountable feat.
But Walken commands enormous sympathy in his role while Hall comes off as shallow and self-satisfied.
Naturally, the hippie school was the embodiment of everything good and wonderful while The Establishment (meaning; everyone and everything else) was shown as being corrupt, venal, sadistic, and without any positive qualities at all.
When the dog is left at home after indulging in too much of Mom's new recipe while the family takes in a movie, the story gets interesting.
"Someone murders people while another man sleeps and makes him believe he did it".
Nicely photographed in color but with actors going a bit overboard while obviously trying to be "realistic".
It has been a while since I have see Mantan Moreland yelling "Feets don't fail me now," but I certainly expected it to come out of the mouth of Dayana Jamine, who played the sister of one of the Black gang members like Moreland.
I love Zombie films, shame no one seems to know how to make them anymore  Black and Hispanic gangs go bang, bang, with a penis replacement and use words like hoe and other stereo typical so called black gangster related sayings and while they try, listening people?
It's kind of a shame really, because while watching it, I couldn't help but feel that with a better script and director, this could have been an enjoyable little zombie flick, and that the Urban Horror genre could finally have had a good recent zombie effort.
You see, this film while being known as Last Rites in the USA is called 48 Weeks Later in the UK.
So, if you want to spend 90 minutes watching black actors running around a badly lit warehouse, shooting blanks at each other while talking like illegitimate sons of Shaft, be my guest.
In a nut shell, Latino and black gangsters hole-up in a warehouse while homeless Zombies rage outside.
Thailand is shown to be a technologically advanced while India is still so backward.
'Threat' contains some of the lamest dialogue I've heard in a while.
But I didn't even notice Slug while I was watching it.
But the fun of hating this movie (that occurs while they're cruising around L.A. drinking generic beer, which becomes banally involving) withers when the actual party begins, and for the next (what feels like an eternal) forty-five minutes we cut back and forth to various people who look like they're all buddies of the director as they drink beer, swear, philosophize, swear, drink beer, snort meth like it's cocaine, quote classic films (mostly Apocalypse Now), and swear some more: while drinking beer.
Then Micro takes acid (from a guy who's part of a very confusing and completely pointless B-story involving a briefcase) while fully clothed in a bathtub and has a dream where he's starring in his own presidential campaign commercial: RAPPING in front of an American flag while continuously "flipping the bird".
"The Vanishing 1988" tells of the dogged search of a man for his girlfriend who disappears while they're together on holiday.
And while "Ginger Snaps II" is not better than the original, I'm proud to have it as a sequel to one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
i was forced to watch this piece of fecal matter cinema while taking an English analysis and interpretation class.
The unsatisfying part is that while we see many details of these two men's lives, we are given little insight into their motivations.
-During the whole novel Victor refuses to tell anybody how he created the creature, while in the novel we have all this detail.
My husband fell asleep while watching it because he found it so boring.
I am sad to say that while I was in college, I helped work on this film and am therefore privy to certain inside information.
The French schoolteacher is superbly evil in his own secretive way, whilst all the while maintaining his respectable front to the local community.
He proceeds to rip the hearts out of basically everyone in the hospital while stalking the one girl whose body he wants to inhabit - using his, also unexplained, demonic powers.
Yeah, of what little plot there is, the details don't make a whole lot of sense - like the hospital being mostly empty aside from a small group of people and a tornado popping up at the end to ultimately vanquish the "evil"... Robert Englund plays a small but highlighted role as the sheriff who put the psychotic organ-snatcher away and is killed off FAR too soon, while the rest of the cast does nothing but provide clichÃ©s that move things along until the film's end.
The film is about a killer who is hit by lightening while getting sitting in the electric chair and becomes an unstoppable killer after he's taken to the morgue in the hospital.
And while the sets are unconvincing and understaffed and the script and story derivative and pedestrian this is hardly the worst direct to video horror movie I've seen.
It correctly argues that workers should always keep safety in mind while working, but implies that the company would willingly allow people to take time off for simple dizziness or not penalize workers for falling behind in their work.
But it's possible to laugh at the goofy MST3K lines while remembering the short's message: that safety must be consciously and continuously practiced in hazardous environments.
Having believed her lover's story that there would be money set aside for her while she cooled her heels in prison, Gloria soon finds out there is nothing, so, enraged and knowing the boy's worth, she kidnaps him at gun point and off they go, on the run from the mob.
He isn't helped any by a screenplay that manages to ape the original while making absurd "updates" and taking liberties that cleanly toss out such things as believability and common sense.
A heavy emphasis on atmosphere, decor and sex while devoid of any substance.
I assumed it would be about his turn to Russia, while instead it focused on his love of Harcourt (a very floppy Cary Elwes) and disgust for hypocritical friends.
Is it funny that Julianne Moore packs up and leaves Hugh Grant, slamming the door behind her while he's trying to talk to her, because he's been distant and uninvolved?
another question after all what happen in occupied Palestine is military resistance.. so why all the media & obviously the movie maker insist on covering it from an Islamic point of view while in regard to the brutal fights like in Latin America it's about the liberty & getting red of corruption.
For a while.
Clearly John Travolta was out of his mind, and while I am the kind of person who would like nothing better than to go on a religious tirade about the scientology undertones of this horrible cinematic abortion, I will refrain and instead urge everyone who owns this movie to break the disc in half without so much as an afterthought.
It parallels some of the situations that both of our leading guys are going through....and it's cool that Rex is wearing a yellow jersey (like the Tour leader) during those frantic scenes while he looks for Saskia.
If you have "leverage" you can do whatever you like and they will stand dumbfounded while listening to you explain your "leverage" in great detail.
These are only a few of the things I became to know while viewing this masterpiece.
After a while, I stopped even trying to find anything good in this mess and sat watching in sullen silence, unwilling to admit defeat by walking out, but determined not to see the film again.
while the rest want to know the plot.
By the end of "Haunts," I was confused and apathetic...this might have had something to do with my lulling in and out of sleep while watching.
anyway after a while, the sheriff (who sounds like he has a touch of the throat cancer) and his cronies discover who the killer is and the good ol boys take him out.
As you would probably imagine, you have to wait quite a while to get to this moment in the film.
Burton's bits in English as the self-important Trotsky could have been interpolated later while everyone else could have acted in a language in which he could show a little expression.
thats not true, most normal ppl do stay together for quite a while.
It, as well as the rest of the film, is depressing, dark, and somber, and while I wouldn't call it a "twist" (because it really isn't), it's still extremely effective.
It didn't show how he ate up his 15 minutes while he plowed through Generosa's (or Ted's) money.
Their flaws are revealed, making them more endearing: during the drive he becomes macho and demanding, while she rebels and becomes petty and shrill.
She's earthy and fun-loving, while he is quietly appreciative of her company.
And like the rotten cherry on top, Mrs. Jack A-Hole and Dragon Lady duke it out in one room over his precious journal while the wife of a client he is desperate to land insists on aping Sharon Stone in another room while his Top Client (over whom Jack A-Hole kicked Mrs. Jack A-Hole out of the house) drops in to beg forgiveness!
Why, when a soldier comes into the barracks drunk and late while everybody is asleep, does he pee on another guys face?
And, after turning into a bad fighting machine that looks like he fell into a vat of flour while using the drug, he then insists on injecting others!
And, while I know it's common place as pie to take someone else's brain child and "improve" upon it until it resembles something original and creative, the improvements and innovations here ARE creative and original.
In the American presentation there`s ad breaks while over the pond we get to see Johnathan Ross interviewing guests for their opinions during the ad breaks .
The story was simple enough; Rex's girlfriend mysteriously disappears at a gas station they stopped at while on vacation.
The acting in the scene where the girl gets out of the car and is crawling across the ground while being "eaten" by the werewolf is actually laughably bad.
It should be noted that the American Fritz really did hate his life, while the U.K. version's vices (gambling, booze, and adultery) kept him alive.
If this movie is based on the same concept I think it is, than it did a horrible job of presenting it in an even remotely believable way unless, of course, there really is a town out there where the drunks roam the woods alone at night while the bartender leaves her post for a quick snack every night.
I own the DVD collection and while some episodes aren't great or even good most of them are excellent.
A lady develops a tumor like bulge on her neck, a shrink's patients start freaking out, surgeons and doctors can't treat the woman but it just got weirder and weirder while the actors tried to keep a straight face.
The scene where one of Curtis' clients is lifted off the floor, by Misquamacas, and sent down a flight of stairs while spouting Native American gibberish has to be seen to be believed.
Curtis was doing pretty much everything to pay the bills about this time period, so although he's not exactly phoning it in as Harry, he's also got this look like he's going over lines for his next gig in his head, even while he's doing this one.
As for Susan Strasberg...well, she is a knockout, and she doesn't have much to do except play a second-generation copy of Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST, while looking like Quasimodo's girlfriend.
And then she gets to 'camp it up' at the end, with some visual effects that look like what George Lucas left on the cutting room floor while making STAR WARS.
In desperation, she turns to her ex-lover Curtis, a false medium who reads tarot cards to little old ladies while wearing a fake mustache, a velour robe that has the signs of the Zodiac printed on it and quite possibly the tightest jeans in the history of the movies.
The couple rekindles their romance and she is admitted to the hospital while Curtis scrambles for answers.
The acting, direction, and script had such an amateurish feeling that after a while I just simply wanted it to end.
Kind of soaps on steroids that grind you down after a while: i.e.
Zal was disappointing (so promising actress in her early movies like Testament or Amelia, I hoped she'll become something like Mare Winningham, but this movie maybe didn't give her enough opportunity), Perry was better in flashback scenes and quite inconceivable when dealing with her wife's death and being a suspect for her murder, Greene had too small part and I wonder how low can she fall, while Benzali was the only reason one could enjoy in this movie.
I don't think I laughed a single time while watching this movie.
in full Jack (THE SHINING) Nicholson mode, while his victims/successors are your typical teens: one white and one black, obsessed with carnage-happy video games but who cringe in the face of real death Â so they dare one another to enter a morgue at night and take a good look at the latest 'intern'Âand that is where their troubles begin.
Their reactions, however, are different: while the black boy seems resigned to have joined the ranks of the undead (culminating in a predictable coda, down to the ironic closing line, as he sets out to 'infect' The Big Apple), the other resists Â especially after Ironside kidnaps his kid sister to be the blood donor in his initiation!
Sometimes, while I'm watching this show, I actually begin to wonder if this was sort of a "how-not-to-make-a-sitcom" show.
In the episode I saw, something happened to Drake and they both stood there smiling, while saying lines (happily) which would suggest that they were angry.
while i really enjoyed "Urban Legend" and "Urban Legends:Final Cut" i can't say the same for this one.i found it boring,pointless,and annoying.the character of "Bloody Mary" is about as scary a "Tickle me Elmo" from Sesame Street.not only that,but this thing was predictable from the get go.the first 2 were not.at least i didn't think so.this movie does have a twist of sorts,and the only reason it may be unpredictable is that it is so preposterous that no one for a minute would believe it actually happens.there's no way things could have ended up the way they did.but in this movie,they do.the characters themselves are just silly caricatures.and lets not forget the ending.illogical and unsatisfying.i'd say the acting was bad,but i don't see how it could have been anything else in this movie.overall,this movie is awful.1/10
Derek, constantly giving members of the party the one fingered salute, eventually is kicked out, then returns, then leaves on his own will, returns again, shoots a woman in the stomach so the ridiculously slow and idiotic zombies can feast on her, and is finally strung up to a tree whilst the group takes turns punching him in the balls (while zombies surround them) That's pretty much the basic plot line for this excuse of a movie.
This movie has nothing to make it worth while.
It has some novel ideas, such as illegally obtaining a fresh cadaver that has to be transported from the city morgue to the school, while rigor mortis is beginning to set in.
At the same time, a reporter is trying to uncover the story of the massacre while trying to deal with his angry son.
The man who dastardly invented these mutant bugs seems to also have picked up the use of super warp speed traveling while working in the lab late at night.
This they figure out while bugs get zapped while trying to get into a silo!
If you loved the original 1984 'COTC', you may take a while to realise how awful this futile sequel is.
So while there is one or two original things here, the overall feeling, for me was "boring"!
The draw of the first half makes it all worthwhile to me, it's just berserk: Rip Taylor screaming and throwing fake snow around while photographing a topless extra from "Jesus Christ Superstar."
I lose concentration many times while watching this movie.
But I can't pretend I tried to follow the storyline, as I kept missing bits when they spoke too softly while I was laughing.
The script by Argento & Franco Ferrini while Carlo Lucarelli has a 'collaboration' credit has all the classic Argento ingredients like the black gloved killer, the ultra shiny selection of knives & blades, a ridiculous plot & a few glimpses of his unique style.
Non Ho Sonno feels like a commercial attempt at making a film that utilises what Argento is best known for but at the same time he was under pressure to make it a success, while this is undeniably a Giallo I felt that it tried to incorporate elements from American teen horror that was proving very successful at the time like Scream (1996), I know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998), Final Destination (2000) & their various sequels & imitators.
Then, she produces a fake marriage certificate the next morning--which complicates his life, as he already is married--to a lady that Clark met while in prison!!!
I don't say I could do this better, but this was one of the most boring films I've seen in quite a while.
}with getting his butt stuck in a window as he is flashing people(I couldn't help it..I giggled uncontrollably), dresses as a woman while spying on chicks showing their tits, and gets his stomach ripped open with guts splattering out.
In one scene of this movie the heroine's friend and partner becomes lost in the dream house, looking for a way to get out, while the heroine searches for her in the real one, looking for a way to get through.
I love sci-fi movies and hoped this would at lest entertain me for a while.
He appeared in approximately 32 movies while at Universal International and post that he appeared in several to a few movies of varying quality.
I found it extremely hard to watch and had to turn off after a while.
Some people get killed while Palance smokes cigars.
If you can keep from nodding off while watching this, you're a more determined viewer than I.  I saw this on "Shilling Shockers" with host Penny Dreadful.
My opinion is that the killer was probably singing the meow mix song in their head while replacing the lyrics "i'm a killer, i'm a killer, stab my husband in the baaackk".
If you're a male who wants to have something stupid running in the background while you access your computer, you may enjoy this movie.
When he meets his end, the scene is so perfunctory, so devoid of weight, that while Hackman lends some much-needed credibility with his totally unmoved reactions, Stone destroys the whole thing with some incredible overacting.
The movie begs sympathy for these girls while the only people actually doing harm to them are themselves.
Evan Rachel Wood's Tracy is entirely irritating and ridiculous, and while watching this film I found myself not feeling sympathetic but annoyed.
This movie is the best example for what happens, when someone does not focus on the script while making a movie.
The DVD booklet says a lot about intimacy, about how this intimacy with the characters was developed while making the movie.
In an interview the director (who shows his semi-existent camera skills in too many shaky scenes) talks about the script becoming "a kind of map with a lot of blanks to be explored while filming", and thats shown in the movie.
has its highlights where you can at least smile a bit, at Asylum there is no single scene where you could be just a bit frightened, well maybe just at the thought how much of good old money was spent for making this, while it could be put to better more not-stupid things, like i don't know THROWING IT TO GARBAGE!
We are shown her as a child walking down a dark hallway in her parents home while her parents are heard to be yelling.
At least, he does this for a while.
Some of the CGI-actors turn out to be real people and they are held hostage by Homeland Security for 3 weeks being thoroughly interviewed while none of the returnees remembers a damn thing of their trip in the ball of Light.
The premise, while fantastic, could have been much better executed.
Bob ingratiates himself with Marvin's family while in the meantime driving Marvin nuts.
Also, I noticed that his second in command had 82nd Airborne patches, while his superior had 101st Airborne patches.
Three renegade German soldiers -- who somehow know about the treasure trove of Dutch artifacts and artworks -- are introduced in the crudest possible way, i.e., as they interrupt an S.S. bureaucrat while he's in a dalliance with courtesan.
It's sequel "Vampire Bats"(while still far from perfect), draws on this film's strengths and builds upon them.
The problem, though, is that while the Powers films were sleazy, they also were funny in an undemanding and crude way.
Because of this, Austin comes off as a joke while Helm comes off as a boorish pig...an old, alcoholic and boorish pig.
the horrible plot: a country boy working at a gas station starts working for a puppet master while Toulon(the puppet master) plans to turn the boy into a puppet.
Another thing is while Magrew makes Robert carve a puppet out of wood the puppet Magrew uses at the end is actually made out of metal is some awful looking tank like creation with a couple laser guns for arms.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
Curse of the Puppet Master is worse than the five previous Puppet Master films & to be honest they should have stopped making them after Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge while the series was on a high.
There are two kinds of characters on THE SHIELD: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope.
This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while and I went to see this with friends, basically it turned us into those kids you hate in movies.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
It is unfortunate that some of the others who claim to be adults while reviewing work on this site do not.
while it is good it just didn't have the magic the 1st did, and while the ending is really quite surprising, I never did care too much for it,plus Emily is able to match her amazing performance in the 1st!.
It actually looks a lot like that other film of his, "06", only the protagonists are now face-to-face, while "06" exclusively featured two people talking over the phone.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
So, while I agree it's a good movie (and changed the face of movie musicals) I can't say I enjoyed it.
The lines are terribly clichÃ©' and the actors, while capable, are just waiting for there time to speak, never fully absorbed into the movie.
And while "Neverwas" never will be remembered as fondly as those tales, it does manage to skim off the top of their inspiration and come up with a flimsy, smug movie that mimics much better movies.
Just finished watching this and have to say that while we usually find IMDb to be spot on in regards to movie details, this one has a mistake on it.
Writer/director/producer Greg Lamberson's first stab creating his own low-budget horror film comes across as a cross between "Street Trash" and "the Stuff" while being not quite as entertaining as either of the two aforementioned movies.
While the Godfather un-deservedly got Best Picture for 1973, it got a total of only 3 Oscars, while Cabaret got 8 (including Best Director)--making it the movie to have gotten the most Oscars without also getting Best Picture.
The problem with this kind of film is that people who adhere to democratic values need not be taught this stuff at such a childish - and sometimes downright stupid - level, while the capitalist viewer sees a conformation of his prejudice that a "communist" director has neither the intelligence nor the good taste to make a film about the working class that is worth spending his costly time on.
All in all, not a bad movie if you like to make fun of a movie while you watch it.
Director Payne films like a TV film & while it's competent it lacks any style.
Though I have seen Tim Curry do some of the most startlingly different roles while still coming off as brilliant, this is not one of them.
When Grandpa and Grandma Addams get the rare Wontheimer's (?spelling) disease that is slowly turning them normal, Gomez decides to take his family to a family reunion, but end up going to the Adams family reunion instead, while an ordinary couple ends up at the Addams family home.
I have no idea what batch of crap the people behind this rubbish were smoking while doing this, but it was certainly very strong.
The humor of the film is as bad as it gets; whereas the first two had great black humor, this one is reduced to childish humor, which just every once in a while has a bit of 'blackness' to it.
Technically the show's fine & even pretty impressive as it belies it's low budget made-for-TV roots, the special effects are excellent as usual although how the actor's managed to keep a straight face while acting this stuff out is beyond me.
(For those who don't know: SSDD was used in a Steven King book: Dreamcatcher, while not the best book its bad to rip off someone elses phrasing even if you do change one word in it)  It seemed to me that the story was copying 'It' also by Steven King.
We don't know, because the movie mentions none of these things, choosing instead to depict the restriction against ponytails while reiterating that "Japan is losing its way."
The seemingly endless confrontations and arguments between Chris and Pam become rather monotonous after a while.
This is the first movie I've seen in a while with no redeeming qualities.
Not only does Chris do nothing about her illness, he also turns a blind eye while she does drugs and drinks.
Brian seems touchingly innocent and uncorrupted, while Sally is the lively opportunist, who's not unwilling to sleep with producers in hope of a film career.
It's scenes like this that, while creepy, really cross the line.
Cabaret takes place at the tail end of the Weimar Republic era as Sally and her crowd party on while Germany is surrendering its freedom to an authoritarian minded party and its leader.
Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.
I could see young Rolf who became a Nazi while courting the Von Trapp eldest being part of that.
Also, while I do agree that Minelli deserved the Oscar for her demanding performance, I was very surprised to see Joel Grey get one as well.
Overall, while this was a very interesting film, I didn't particularly enjoy it.
Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings starts in the isolated 'Ferren Woods 1958' where a deformed boy named Tommy (J.P. Manoux) is happily eating his slop that his guardian Miss Osie (Lilyan Chauvin) has left for him when a group of six teenagers come along, capture him, beat him & eventually murder him... Jump forward to the present day & New York City cop Sean Braddock (Andrew Robinson) is returning to his childhood town to become the local Sheriff together with his wife Beth (Caren Kaye) & teenage daughter Jenny (Ami Dolenz), at first things seem perfect but while trying to make friends Jenny becomes involved with Danny (J. Trevor Edmond) & his gang.
For some bizarre reason this inspired a video game called Bloodwings: Pumpkinhead's Revenge (1995) while two more film sequels have been made recently Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes (2006) & Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud (2007).
Ironically, the problem for GI's was the same here as in VietnamÂhow to distinguish friendly civilians from the enemy, while too often the solution was to kill them all.
Although I will give it to Hopper for keeping a straight face while reading terrible lines.
And after the killer shows great mental powers by killing all the men in his path and escaping, he realizes the movie is going to end so he lets the girl shoot him so we don't get the would-be-delicious con-mentally-overpowers-stupid-but-gorgeous-scientist-and screws her as she gasps don't, while stripping.
Me sitting with a pile of friends, eagerly clasping their hands and gazing at the blank screen, eyes shining, all the while babbling to me that I (not having seen the first movie) was in for a total treat.
Her singing, while jaw-dropping to say the least, is just one part of her role.
"Two Ladies" is sung while Max, Sally, and Brian drive to his mansion.
Upon closer inspection one will notice that the majority of bad reviews, like my own, are based on the original theatrical release (The Quickening), which is truly awful, while the majority of good reviews are based on another version of the movie (The Renegade Edition), which, I am told, is actually quite good.
His work on "Lenny" was outstanding, and while this didn't speak as greatly, you could see his influences on the script and final edit.
Oh, and Sean Connery's character from the first movie (Juan RamÃ­rez) manages to come back to life for a little while, to help Conner MacLeod.
The Quickening version runs 89 minutes, while the Renegade version runs 109.
Pollock's character, Eli, is a rote "Ladies' Man" while Julie Brown plays 'Zoe' thus accentuating her quirkiness.
I honestly dislike the show so much now that I can't even let my TV be on AS while i am doing something else.
The show is based on the premise if that the mere act defying conventions while ridiculing them in and of itself is interesting or entertaining.
Or how about a "Beaver Boys" sketch where a bloated Tim eats shrimp while getting it all over his face for no reason.
Or they do a horrible rap song about corn left in fecal matter while covering them selves in chocolate pudding-WITH REAL CORN IN IT!!
Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame.
and add to that crap, - while the whale thing is going, there's a stranger with an ex outside.
There are lots of details in the movie - brightly exposed to us by an excellent cameraman - which create a second, historical storyline which you start to understand only after you watch the movie for a while.
Some of these early talkies are downright dreadful while some others are just odd curios.
I'm a believer that there are no bad concepts, just bad execution, so while it may have been possible to make a good movie using Jarmusch's structure and theme, this is not that movie.
When I was a teenager, my stepfather used to rent these bad action flicks all the time, and I would sneak into his room and snatch them while he was gone to work, watching them.
While the criminals had automatic weapons which could fire off an endless supply of ammunition, they couldn't hit their desired targets while the heroes, with only handguns, could shoot a few bullets and down the opposition almost immediately.
So Maher, playing the scumbag ohh so perfectly drives off with Kate and her bags while Jesse and Charlie commence prying the skull away from a Ptierodactyl.
She carries a 9mm in her stockings while she is in concert, i mean come on.
A serious upper class young man, he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance, while looking for an apartment to share.
Documentary about celebrities who utilize hyperboles (like they should die in a fire while eating a sand hamburger) to describe their critics so you feel sorry for them.
Plus, after a while, it was obvious that there was an invisible guy running about--talk about a great way to maintain your cover!
When I was 7 I'd be humming this at school or while I was walking down the road.
The problem is not that the quality of the humor in this movie ever dips lower than that of the shorts, it's that the jokes are endless, and you get tired of grunting out a half-hearted laugh after a while.
There was a deal if you buy one movie, you get another one, my mom picked it while she was getting the "Awesome" Dog Soldiers.
A harbinger of this film was while renting it, the women at the register couldn't get the security seal off.
Two young couples stay at a country-house for the night for a little game of "truth and dare", drinking, and sex while a killer begins to pick them off one by one while filming the action on video camera.
Director Mathieu Kassovitz has been in the business for a while now and is a well complete actor as well and still something about this project went wrong.
Sadly, the only character that we really get to know is just Toorup, who is played by Vin Diesel, he is the only one with depth, while they could have had a little focus on the girl, Aurora, how did she get her powers or was she really ill?
Over all, this isn't a terrible movie, but I would say definitely to wait for the rental, because while the effects are very good and the whole setting is disturbing, it's the story that leaves you dumbfounded and just bummed that the story ended the way it did.
The sex scenes seem to go on & on forever, they are at times quite strong with actual masturbation & fellatio although these scenes are brief while at other times they consist of nothing more than two people kissing for what seems like an eternity.
It was like listening to stereotypical mambo-jumbo and, it may sound "arty" for a while but on the long run it brings nothing more than a head-ache.
Strangely enough Mr. perfect have no troubles killing innocent prison guards while he time after time jeopardize the mission and his crew to protect female criminals.
This show jumped the shark after the writer changes and while I liked Mr Sorbo's work as an actor in previous endeavors, his dumbing down of the show was a bad move.
Once again, as in the earlier film two years before, we have babes in bikinis toting machine guns, killing people while saying 'poor little man' and smirking and simpering and wiggling their busts.
Minutes of frippery go by while neither asks the question: WHAT HAPPENED?
It's much easier to pile a bunch of crap in an old push wagon and hit the road again to defend it in the open air against every marauder and sneak thief that walks by, while you slowly die from exposure.
Part of the reason is that she wasn't wearing a goofy owl mask while she did it.
The voice acting, while pretty good, isn't anything particularly special.
Also the constant swearing, violence and sex wore me down and got dull after a while.
So my suggestion is; if you haven't seen any of the fritz movies, watch the first one only, this one isn't quite worth while.
Once in a rare while, a good idea does emerge from the quagmire, only to disappear again in a welter of self-indulgence, grossness, gutter language and rank stupidity.
While I am not a member of this counterculture and don't relate to it personally very well, I did try to keep an open mind while watching both movies, and neither one really shocked me that much - maybe because they're getting older and I've witnessed more shock value in recent movies.
It's a mess of 70's clichÃ©s, which, since it came out in 1981 (although it might have been on the shelf for a while), you've got to believe were stale, even then.
Every 10 minutes or so there are these big emotional outbursts, and while you do eventually come to know why, there still is a serious separation.
Shakes the Clown is his debut as a writer/director and tells the story about an alcoholic clown who, while passed out drunk, is framed for the murder of his boss and mentor.
As for the desired by woman, he has a one night stand and a girlfriendÂhe is just being tormented by the number of ladies all over himÂas for the bartenders, he usually is outside while the friends stick to the bar.
My favorites were the cop putting a gun two inches from a convict's face in the background while Bobcat is released from jail and the production company responsible for the clown television show, (watch the credits on the TV for it).
His jovial, consoling advice to Ophelia to "get thee to a nunnery" is laughable, and while he hits the right note in the also well-conceived, but displaced finish to the scene, leaving the rest of the speech on her answering machine, we're still so busy laughing that the rage loses it's power.
And while it's true that the story is inherently introspective and melancholy, the director fails to explore the many possibilities available to him-- especially with the contemporary setting-- that could have made this vibrant and exciting cinema, such as the way writer/director Julie Taymor brought Shakespeare's `Titus' to the screen so successfully.
Bill Murray's Polonius, while a good try, just was not up to it.
This documentary makes indirect suggestions of a significant Jewish population in Palestine prior to the 1900s, while the fact that the territory was colonized by Jews of foreign origin is shrugged off.
So we have this millionaire widow who's bank account is full of money they don't deserve and who can't keep her kids under control while spoon feeding them... and after all of that whacking it on TV so that the rest of the people on planet Earth know our lives will always be more meaningful...
Unfortunately having established these bikers are ruthless violent criminals the screenwriters inject a piece of violent action which is totally unnecessary and which draws attention to their actions iun the context of the movie  If truth be told these bikers could have been amongst the best screen villains of the 1990s but the cast are let down by the screenplay , it's both very contrived while failing to explain some things .
There were constant spats on the set with the biggest complaint that Murphy would arrive three hours late for filming while everyone would have to set around and wait for him to show up.
So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong.
Good taste is never a factor in what's included in this movie, and while that generally is no deterrent for me, there are some places where I just have to draw the line.
If reviewers are using anything even remotely resembling my criteria for film criticism, I have a difficult time understanding anyone thinking that a film like Sixteen Tongues is great while they also think that films like Boogeyman or Gothika are horrible.
They're celebrating the simple existence of independent films made on extremely low budgets, which are marketed as being somewhat "underground", and in which filmmakers are trying to do something different artistically while they deal with at least some controversial subject matter.
Although there is almost constant nudity, and there are a couple violent scenes, the vast majority of screen time is taken up with incessant talking and relatively inactive shots of these three characters while they provide narration.
My favorite scene is the one at the drive-in, where people are watching a movie with a cheesy monster attacking a bimbo, while the "being" attacks people in their cars.
As the Shaw quote that starts off the film notes, you'd better make people laugh while you're telling them the truth.
while after winning the civil war they might have implemented censorship for the sake of keeping slaves quiet, they wouldn't have used such a statist policy for its own sake.
while they were racist and perhaps apathetic when it was convenient, they were by no means the fascists that kevin willmott portrays them as, and many slaves were freed before the war was over.
Then, for a while, we're back on track with Bond meeting up with 006 and the planting of the bombs, Trevelyan's convincing "execution" by Orumov and Bond's escape.
Rollin has got together a wealth of hot young French girls to star in the film, and while it doesn't compensate for the plot; at least the casting might stop you from falling asleep.
When Anna died, she was partying in Florida while her infant daughter was in the Bahamas being cared for by unknown persons.
The set and lighting, while not thoroughly professional looking, are good indeed and do help to make the movie as good as it is.
while making this movie ?!!
Sira Stampe is robotic as James I's wife, while Robert Carlyle's James is as unconvincing as he is unhinged.
I had also seen an interview with one of the stars on Fuse a while back and desired to see it then.
This horror omnibus gives us 4 tales of surprising unoriginality that will keep you guessing at what the next lame horror clichÃ© is going to be, while offering some amusing 80's star watching.
They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking "pay-dirt" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise.
The art of satire is to mirror life while leaving an artist's touch (of opinion); however, if this is dir.
Apparently Tim Burton was set to direct this but decided to make Ed Wood (1994) instead, he might have actually injected some horror & mystery into the plot while still retaining the Gothic romance just like he did with his excellent Sleepy Hollow (1999).
So I think it goes without saying that while Julia is a very good actress, she can't do Broadway or accents!
while running all over Edinburgh on errands for Dr Jekyll for whom she nurses an ill-concealed passion.
If you are a new neighbours watcher you will most likely watch this, if you were a loyal neighbours fan, probably haven't watched it for a while, don't bother watching it you will be deeply upset but its catastrohic downfall.
- Exhausted by the effort of slapping man with a bottle, The Sandman stands bolt still for a good 5 seconds before diving on the floor while Burke waves his feet in his general direction.
A couple of choice scenes to demonstrate the cheeziness of this movie -- First, the scene in which Gooding gets all the inmates to tear up their playing cards while the inspirational music swells and you half-expect the cast to start the slow-unison clap from those awful highschool sports movies.
Looking at the message board on this page several people are asking when this film was released while people who've actually seen THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY are now asking why it was released .
Students: note the grossly ineffective vocal inflections, the myopic combinations of fake-English-lord and California slurring, the twitching rather than walking, the gesticulating wildly while raising shoulders and rocking back and forth and jerking the head.
It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.
Too much time is spent on the cutesy antics of Shirley Temple, while too little time is devoted to the development of the plot and characters.
after the first 15 minutes the story seemed to turn in circles- which actually was a good thing for a friend of mine, who got out of the theater to buy some drinks and returned 15 minutes later: I didn't have to tell him what was going on while he was gone, because actually nothing happened at all.
I think it only has 2 seasons left, but I still love the show, and enjoy it while it lasts.
The trio must adjust to the strange new world, where medieval weaponry is mixed with modern technology, all the while trying to find a way to travel back home.
The scientist becomes separated from the young couple and they attempt to find him, all the while a warlord is trying to stop them, so he can take the young woman for his own," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.
Reading other user comments this movie seemed to appeal to people imbued with a sense of unreality,people decrying the intrinsic Communism of Hollywood while most of the reviews coming from outside the US almost universally condemn this movie as being idiotic at best.
Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart.
I suspect the movie was financed so the director and actors could have an 'adventurous' vacation and make a movie while they were at it.
This leaves the movie as an 18 year old's fantasy of what he could do if he left his home town in anger and embarrassment and had hot chicks falling for him through a series of adventures while traveling on money provided by a cool dad living vicariously.
And while we are there we will make a movie too!"
The one moment the movie is about the Daniel Stern character, while the other it's about the John Heard and the other its about good old Captain Bosch.
The creatures are meant to horrify but merely look like inept Halloween window displays, while the unbearable synthesized score sounds like a seven-year-old toying with a department-store display organ.
There is a funny scene where some guys are trying to contact someone while the guy near the other line is yawning in your face.
We have a "worldy widow" whose "christian neighbor" judges while forgetting her own sins including gossip, pride, and slander among many others.
Molly really tries to do the best for her daughter, while living with the "stigma" of being the local "Women at the Well" (again in Scripture).
I don't expect everything in a movie to be completely correct, after all it is entertainment, but at least once in a while something should work in theory in the real world!
Fifth, come to think of it, Hilary Swank, while not as voluptuous as the young Raquel Welch (who could be?
Some of the final shots of Moreau's camp burning to the ground while the now-dead doctor himself hangs from a railing in the foreground are impressive too, but the movie hasn't really earned them.
It gets tired after a while.
First, maybe I was still kind of young (but it happened while I was in HS) and I just don't remember any kind of nudie bar involved in the movie.
Matty gives it a 7 while the average voter gives it a 4.9.
It gets tired after a while.
I heard about this film while at the NY Horror film festival where the audience was told they HAD to see this intense & brutal movieÂand I read some reviews that called it amazing and grippingÂLIES!
SPOILER This film, while fascinating and beautifully made, seems little more than a glorification of self-mutilation.
).I also noticed that all the actors were at least in their thirties while their characters were high school kids.
It`s as though the screenwriter got bored with the subplot and discarded it while he was writing it and the film is littered with these subplots that are unexplained and go nowhere .
It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask.
while rescuing the girl from the woods was mundane.
Now, that's not to say the movie doesn't make us laugh, because there are several sequences in the film that are down right hysterical, proving that a movie can be successfully made about an imaginary six foot rabbit, but most of the funny scenes accrue during the first twenty minutes, for the one joke this film has gets stale after a while.
Stewart's Dowd cannot help but be loved, while Anderson's Dowd feels wooden, and I ordinarily like Harry Anderson.
Based on the Hecht-MacArthur play, a newspaper editor and his ace reporter battle each other while fighting civic corruption in Chicago.
Actually, I had watched the godawful MYRA BRECKENRIDGE (1970) on TV while I was in Hollywood a few months ago so I was really expecting the worst here.
West, having enjoyed a late film career resurgence with 1970's "Myra Breckinridge", made one final celluloid splash before her death (at least, it is widely reported that she was still alive while filming this!)
Periodically the action, such as it is, grinds to a dead halt while Mae croons some totally unrelated ballad.
All the while West is posturing like mad, looking like something they found in the wreck of the "Titanic".
The fact that Mae appears to have dunked her head in a bowl of make up and is filmed through what appears to be guaze seems to indicate that all others concerned were at least trying to take pity on the poor woman while at the same time humoring her.
), Mae's costume changes look like an expensive Edith Head designed drag show, and Mae cracking unabashed double entendres while staring cross-eyed through heavy lids ("I want them to say the British are coming") is mind boggling.
director araki concentrates (as always) on backgrounds-especially colors, so be sure to take in the different surroundings while viewing this.
dark is a true anti hero and while i personally believe the doom generation is the better film, james duvall's role as dark here has much more depth than the dopey jordan in tdg.
Katherine Isabelle is back but essentially in a cameo as the ghost of Ginger while once again the angst ridden sister Bridget is the centre of the story.
this movie is not that great.i found the story too banal(ordinary).there's not much originality here.it's a combination of many other movies.it's equal parts a Christmas Carol,It's a Wonderful Life,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,and Even The Cat in the Hat movie.the movie isn't very funny,but there is a bit of slapstick that works.this movie is,i felt,overly sentimental and preachy.in fact,i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is.now,don't get me wrong.family is very important.i just find that subtlety works best with these movies.this was just way too heavy handed for me.but there is some good news.the movie has a great visual style.i mean,it looks fantastically magical.and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost,the baddie of the piece.he's not really scary,more mildly disconcerting than anything,and even a bit sad.i also like the look they gave him.this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker.anyway,this is a case of style over substance.and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2,i still don't think it was as good.the negatives just outweigh the positives.for me,The Santa Clause 3 is a 4/10
So while there is no sign of Uwe Bohl directing (not nearly enough copious amounts of blood) nor any appearance of Wings Hauser (who probably would have fit well), this movie still sucks.
Sometimes his metaphors are obvious and sometimes not and while this is definitely not a movie that every one will enjoy-if you have an open mind- it deserves to be seen.
And while this comes as a shock to her father at first, despite the insistence of his girlfriend, Janet (Catherine Hicks) that this is all normal for the girl and in fact, good for her, he is still unconvinced and becomes not only paranoid, but soon enters therapy.
Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
The lines are terribly clichÃ©' and the actors, while capable, are just waiting for there time to speak, never fully absorbed into the movie.
Costas "sneaking up" on character after character while making all kinds of noise, the enemy compound so sophisticated it controls top secret space satellites, but such shoddy security that the marines' walkie-talkies go undetected as far a underground subs and Costas runs around without any surveillance picking him up.
Foolishly, Denise appears to have tried to buy her way into their lives because she's so desperate for love and for a family, but it also appears that she likes the role of favorite woman, lounging around while the others are cooking and cleaning.
I can almost understand polygamy for religious reasons (while recognizing the welfare fraud, statutory rape, and other associated criminal acts that commonly accompany this lifestyle), but this pig of a human openly states that his polygamy has nothing to do with religion - just his inability to keep his organ in his pants.
From the very beginning one can tell that this film is going to be a major head trip, and would likely be best watched while high on some manner of substance.
So while I do hate this growing trend -one that has seen studios offering "condolences" to parents who drag concession-hungry children to see their movies by using two-tiered, age-discriminating humor (I guess so parents can nod knowingly to each other over the heads of their kids, while receiving these studio "winks", as if to say " They didn't get that one, but we sure did -it's because we're OLDER.
The movie, on the other hand, while well-acted and visually attractive, does not seem to understand that it is Janie's character development, not her finding love, that is the most important part of the story--and without this development, even with the chemistry between the actors, the story feels shallow.
Parts of the film which should have been much shorter, as they were only marginally relevant to the story, were given too much time, while other sections which required more time were cut too short to have an impact, i.e.
The book is more geared to a woman audience and i don't really enjoy it that much, and the southern dialect, while giving the book an authentic feel, makes it a hard read.
Columbo leans against a pedestal with a three-thousand-year-old vase atop and juggles it for a moment while Elizondo looks on blankly.
It was a waste of money and time and the character you think may be the normal character I was talking about hardly ever comes up or does anything the rest of the movie is just about stupid people doing stupid stuff that gets on your nerves after a while.
What you see is what you get; there is little subtly ("God Help Us" a large sign cries at one point while the main characters cheerfully ignore it).
And yet somehow, despite most odds, Araki actually manages to construct a film around interesting, affectionate characters, and then pit them in an environment of illicite sex and drugs, disillusionment and disaffection, all while maintaining a level of pathos that (for the most part) is genuine.
Like "Less Than Zero", the plight of central character Dark seems to begin and end with who he's sleeping with, who he'd like to be sleeping with, and who he realistically can sleep with Â all the while looking for a way of bettering himself in the belief that unconditional love should not mean loving everyone with a pulse just for the heck of it.
This is hardly a criticism Â while still on the unpredictability drive, Araki even throws in a large reptilian alien, just to see what happens.
It was a huge review that showcased the talents of the artist and the director while also giving us a backstage pass to a play many of us probably never heard of.
I'm sure that had I had some clue as to what the play was about the scenes we see being worked on might have had some resonance, instead of just seeming to be random.Many people have compared this to Looking For Richard, Al Pacino's film about Richard the Third, while that film had what seemed like random scenes, the play is part of our cultural heritage and so the plot is known by most people.
Basically, it was an excuse to have a lot of young women prancing about in lingerie, maid's uniforms, pretty frocks, while baring the occasional boob.
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
compartment of a running train that too from the train's window?, how can two people see that a tunnel is approaching while traveling in the same train?
Both central characters are blighted by past misfortunes (Lopez is at odds with her family over an incident which occurred ten years previously) and both are wary of romantic involvement, which leads to the inevitable complications: Lopez' hard-bitten cop is unwilling to lower her defences, while Caviezel is the angelic loner whose refusal to confront the past renders his life meaningless.
Harry gets more paranoid as a result of hearing the sentence but while he moves around more frantically he doesn't seem to be going in any particular direction.
This film cannot be compared with Liebeneiner's work because it goes much further openly endorsing the actions of the mother who killed her child, and suggesting that she was merely carrying out the clearly communicated wishes of her daughter, while condemning all those who questioned the right of a mother to kill her child.
It makes about as much sense as Doctor Seuss having a tea party with Frasier Crane and Peter Griffin, All while on LSD and talking about the recent downturn in the economy of slippers.
He ran around in his underwear, climbed up a tree and just sat there for a while.
Two of the crew get busted up by the bear while trying to find water, the initial driver terminally, and the other three scarper in the truck (apparently the radiator is self healing).
They mow down a bear cub and destroy their radiator, all the while howling and screaming along with their screeching tires.
I first saw Grizzly Rage, like so many other Big Creature Eating Attractive People films late one night on the Sci Fi channel with a large group of friends while the majority of us were downing sizable amounts of alcohol.
It may be no coincidence that the title letters of this movie form the acronym SIC, and while it certainly isn't suitable for the mainstream prime time TV slot, serious students of bondage or porn will be disappointed if not downright bored by the film.
I read that this was up on the banned list for a while, not sure if it really was banned or what.
Gregg Champion is a TV movie director, whose groundbreaking technique seems to involve placing the camera down and then rushing off for a cup of tea while the actors say their lines in front of it.
But while the 'sell your land' plot is evocative of Raisin, there's no racial or social dynamic, merely a group of rich city businessmen trying to buy the land of the poor country worker.
I liked the others but this is truly unfunny.the only scene worth watching is two old guys talking a good fight while keeping away from each other.This is more soft porn than comedy.it lacks big names in the cast this time round.The jokes are just not funny.1 out of 10
Askwith, as usual, mugs as if his life depends on it while the movie provides a masterclass in how to make a bunch of attractive women appear completely devoid of sex appeal.
Chanticleer, while supplying a dead-on impression of Elvis Presley down to the voice and the singing (courtesy of Glen Campbell), is a two-dimensional lead.
NYPD Blue started that awful trend, and while NYPD Blue was strangely still a hit (but not as big at it would have been had it been well shot!)
All seemingly while "remaining a virgin for her daddy" whatever that means....not sure I want to know.
I saw a sneak peek of this film while watching The lion king on video and was excited about an American film, a great break from the recent films where the main settings were in Austrailia, France, Arabia, and Africa.
Victoria Rowell, as Samuel L. Jackson's wife, has a long monologue where she lists all of the things she did for their family while he was gone; he's aware of all of them ("I supported you when you enlisted!
Byron was certainly a flawed human being, but Bolt magnifies and distorts those flaws while ignoring many of Lady Caroline's.
It belongs to an age where you had to make your own entertainment, when you only had Dixon of Dock Green on the black and white telly, while going to the movies to see a big colour film - and a woman get her kit off - was a real treat, real decadence.
The best kinds of "different" films are the ones that challenge the norms and conventions of moviemaking while engaging the viewer emotionally in some way.
The ending is also weak, not because the idea (a shoot-out in the fog) is bad, but because it's impossible to believe, while watching it, that you're seeing anything other than one man alone in a studio pretending to be in a fight.
So when I ran across this film while channel surfing one late night, it was a foregone conclusion that I would settle down to watch it.
Several scenes are overly dark and obscuring detail while other scenes are washed out, again, to the point of obscuring detail.
Walter Brennan, Chill Wills and Edgar Buchanan reprise their roles from the original THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG TV-movie made the previous year, while Astaire takes on the role of the troubled Baltimore Kid who might not be in jail or lynched (as newspaperman Andy Devine misinforms them upon their arrival) but has fallen on hard times and become the town drunk instead!
And while the choice of music at the end was pretty, it really didn't fit at all.
Both these movies are MUCH better written and succeed in sweeping the viewer away to a magical world of adventure, while Kismet just seems pretty but dopey--in fact, REALLY dopey.
while "come to daddy" is one of my favorite, "rubber johnny" is far from that.
Zhang Ke has a talent to make you feel relieved or even elated while showing reality at its most bleak.
while part of the acting is fine, and the snakes are semi believable (not outragiously huge) the speed with which the victims die is too exagerated, and it is almost identical to the old movie "Rattler" that is now makign the rounds of network tv movie filler during reruns seasons.
The town is holding some sort of fÃªte so Vic takes the opportunity to introduce himself to the locals, while Vic talks lovers Lacey (Nathalie Roy) & Jake (Daniel Murphy) disappear into the nearby forest where Jake is bitten by an aggressive rattlesnake & dies almost instantly.
All the while I was watching him in this movie, I just kept thinking of the old skits on Mad TV where they used to do the Keanu Reeves School of Acting.
It all has a certain well-measured charm, even if the whimsical wordplay gets overbearing quite often, and ultimately it loses this charm when it is decided that the character Marie is maintaining her dignity when refusing to read aloud pornographic material by de Sade for a geriatric judge and his friends, while finding no moral objection in allowing herself to be seduced by another client.
For a while I kept thinking it was FAIL-SAFE but done as a subplot on the Love Boat.
The prince can't get his hands off her from 20 seconds into their first meeting, the dress which is supposed to be at her ankles shows as high as her panties, all the other male character are constantly smooching her and touching her against her will, while they discuss which of them will get to keep her to satisfy his needs.
Laura Smet (Johnny Hallyday's daughter) has a monotonous acting while Bernard Le Coq's part is underwritten.
The Song is played while they had the party.
Poor folks want to watch "Who wants to become a millionaire" while the limo-democrats want to patronize the 'disadvantaged' by throwing other people's money at the government bureaucrats.
But once in a while there comes along a true genius who comes from down below but with a true gift to show to the world what really is like down there in the real world.
(bizarrely, the bad Englishmen kill all the natives with their diseases, while the Pilgrim Fathers live happily and healthily beside them).
The act of union between England and Scotland didn`t happen until 1707 while the St Patrick cross of Ireland wasn`t added to the flag until later still so considering this movie is set in 1620 it`s totally wrong .
However nearly everyone else is totally wooden while Michael Gambon gives a truly ridiculous performance  Perhaps the best way to evaluate this movie`s true worth is for me to point out my local ITV network broadcast it at 1.40 am
And while Johnny Depp plays his parts with gusto, they do little to add much to a film that was already a lost cause by the time he appears on the screen.
I'm a relatively big rockabilly/psycho fan, so I thought I'd dig this film - but honestly, it was so extremely dull that I could barely sit through the whole thing...  A vampiric Elvis reincarnate woos a local thrift store girl while a bunch of other boring sh!t happens...
So while I didn't really care about this story, his acting in it makes me interested to see what other projects he'll be seen in.
By the end, due to a misunderstanding, the one-time hero is mistaken for a dangerous "wild man," and winds up in jail himself, disgraced and sobbing with frustration while his wife flirts with the Police Commissioner.
There are moving scenes when immigrants with different languages try to communicate to share the commonalities in their lives -- a Russian immigrant is terrified when her passport is taken away, while the Chinese woman is envious that she even has one.
Saw something similar to that camera work during the 1989 earthquake of Northern California while attempting to film the World Series.
This is about a group of underground tunnel workers in NY who come across some molten lava while digging a new sewer.
Two of the above serve as the obligatory divorced couple rekindling their romance while people get zapped by lava all around them.
However, while reading the book, I imagined Kurtz to be quite the stereotypical opposite.
All I could say to my wife while I was watching this was "The book was better."
Maybe it is because I slept a bit while watching this.
There it took a while for them to appear, here we are only at a quarter of the movie.
It seems they just had to be willing to take off their clothes, get groped while showing everything.
So if you want to watch a movie that has some pretty cute guys (not all mind you) having pretty graphic sex while delivering bad dialog, then this ones for you.
But while Erik suffers self-doubt and possibly, Philip suffers a nervous breakdown.
Well, uh, it's about Will Smith running around in slow-motion while talking a lot, and yeah there's this other guy Martin Lawrence who also talks a lot.
Together this cop duo show plenty of attitude while pursuing a ruthless crim who has stolen millions of dollars worth of coke from under the noses of the Miami P.D.
He does all this while, in a retarded ape style, keeps repeating: PUNISH!
At last he goes crazy and kills a bunch of people while moving his eyebrows a lot, because apparently that's what crazy people do.
It's hard to believe director Lee Harry wasn't laughing out loud while directing this thing, it's that bad.
This screen time is merely a shameless excuse to save money while taking cash from paying customers who ventured in to see it.
He provides us with little snippets of his past while chatting with the psychiatrist(..who stupidly insisted that a security guard wait outside the room..this understanding that he's in the room with a man who shot numerous people for no reason whatsoever).
This is why while the original Silent Night Deadly Night is a personal favorite of mine, this film is possibly one of the worst sequels of all time.
The difference here is that while his brother was set off by the sight of Santa Claus, Ricky gets murderous tendencies whenever he sees the color red.
No, all it means is that the writers were probably snorting cocaine while they typed out this script.
As such, if you haven't seen the original in a while, this is a decent horror film.
As Robin's new found freedom is put in jeopardy, she must do whatever she can to remain free, while not hurting the man she really loves.
The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.
Murphy feels out-of-sorts while Reinhold still has the wide-eyed look of someone who is surprised that they're acting in a film at all.
This was fabricated to create a situation of tension while the main character (Owen) was away on his business trip.
The music was catchy the first two or three times you listen to it but can also be repetitive and annoying after a while.
That Cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2-ton sword?
Well, I was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, I'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better.
Nutrition-ed with radiation while in outer space, wasps mutate into giant wind-up toys that mimic a groaning sound like motocross bikes after being sent into orbit on a V-2 rocket during an entomology experiment.
Rani's character then goes off to live with her husband (Vivek) and things go smoothly for a while until they start dealing with issues that surround every married couple.
Kim Basinger is the middle aged Kuki Gallmann, a struggling divorced parent living in 1972 while nurturing her young son, Emanuele.
The mother wore expensive-looking saris, while the sister acted more like a rich party animal.
I watched some of this when going to see another movie, while waiting.
This filming and editing effect is so subtly handled by both the highly experienced cinematographer and the editor so that the viewer's eyes move with the camera so effortlessly, and after a short while, get accustomed to it.
As an added bonus, the film is much shorter than the usual Bollywood formulaic crap, and, because it has the ability to capture the viewer's attention and hold it to the end, the time just flies while you are having fun.
Despite the origin, the two films are different in atmosphere: Tamil one is quite rural looking while, the Hindi one is quite modern and urban in setting.
But let's face it, this is a very clumsy attempt at retelling the life of Valentino and while Nureyev was excellent showing us the tango, he looked like a fish out of water when it came to dialogue.
to see something grabbed him, and try to figure out where Colin's brother went to, then the rest of the movie is pretty much a tale of terror where Javier and the girl with him (forgot name) get information about the past of the beach by a store clerk, where this man and followers lived on the beach and prayed to god for (I think) entry, they never ate real food just what the tide would bring in until one day he brings food and everyone devours it, then they realize he was bringing children from town, well they get man and do a horrendous act by placing him in the sand with his head out and cut his eyelids off while facing the sun, as he was there he prayed for help, but got the wrong religious man, but took the offer so he could take revenge on anyone who comes near his beach.
I love watching C-3PO and R2-D2 always repairing the Star Speeder 3000 while the screen advertises trips to Endor to visit Ewoks or a ski vacation on Hoth, or perhaps a wild adventure on Tatooine.
We all know the lines at Disneyland are murder but there are plenty of cool things to see while waiting.
Banging the table repeatedly while Rhoda plays that infernal piano as smoke billows outside and the yardman screams is NOT acting.
The orchestra and sound effects department whip up a frenzy of a storm while little Patty McCormack is required to -- what?
However, the screenplay doesn't give her enough to do other than hide in cupboards and peek round doors while listening to secret conversations.
I've never had a fondness for Victorian-era horror films, but I do admire the talents of Peter Cushing, Herbert Lom, and Patrick Magee, and thought they'd make this worth my while.
The latter two have extended cameos, while Cushing plays the lead (unfortunately, we have to wait 47 minutes until he makes his grand entrance) and, god bless him, shows not a single hint of the boredom I was feeling in his refined, ultra-classy performance.
Were her lines being tampered with while she was having her hair done?
Mainstream Hindi films in recent decades have neither been very realistic nor critical, but they (at least the good ones) while being entertaining, have embedded some understanding and critique of the larger social context.
This film, while being somewhat of a fable of morality (about love, family ties etc.)
After Aditya's father disrespects Suhani's parents while coming for the alliance and Suhani going to training do they get married secretly.
The title track is best in audio and film, while other great songs 'Naina Milake', 'Chhalka Chhalka Re', and 'Chupke Se' stay with you.
R.H. Thomson is far too bombastic and over-the-top in his part as well, while Pascale Bussieres and Alice Krige are completely forgettable.
Then Chupke Se is another good song while Naina Milake didn't appeal to me.
viciously pressed against his neck, while the impalement of a pair of oblivious lovers clearly rips off Mario Bavaâs far superior A BAY OF BLOOD (1971).
is notable, as are the Swinging London settings; incidentally, the hero is a Spanish actor appearing under the name of Vic Winner â similarly, his character is hilariously named Laurence Redgrave, while that of the Scotland Yard Inspector is Hawkins who has an assistant that goes by the name of Basehart!
O'Donnell is typically bland, while Tyler is not only awfully miscast but a bad actress, as well.
Notice how the Masai are noble, tall, cattle herding folk, contented to tend to their cattle (on bad land, of course), while the few Kikuyu and other people are grafting, if they don't blow themselves up with loose explosives.
It is still ironic how the 'inferior' Kikuyu have managed to get all the good land, while the 'superior' Masai managed to only get land fit for cattle herding.
This is while the African population was driven together on the worst pieces of land.
I also felt a little bit sleepy while watching it.
Since I knew it was about a British heroine parachuted into Vichy France, I was expecting something along the line of the marvellous "Odette" of the 1950s, Odette being a real-life heroine who endured much hardship while aiding the French resistance.
Take one gormless girl, add two competing handsome hunks (one home, one away), mix in a land of franglais where the locals say "good morning Madame" without a single sub-title and you wonder why the heroine had to know any French to become a spy... the kind of spy who keeps saying "what's your real name" while breaking the next person's cover and rushing up to warn the next safe house as the Bosche may or may not have got there before her.
After which it starts to get sensible, but only for a while.
A short while later comes a scene (after said airdrop, of which the enemy had got wind and ambushed it), which shows that the Germans have left bodies of resistant fighters lying unguarded in the middle of a field.
The problem is, that while all these undeveloped 2-D characters would have been great in BILB, they ruined the atmosphere that the audience needed to believe in Tilo's magic.
Ashwarya Rai's voice over after a while becomes boring.
that scene when they're in bed together felt like watching the weather channel, no scratch that, it felt like watching my grandma cutting her toenails while watching the weather channel.
Watching Dan (Brett Butler) try to sneak his old mattress out his ex-girlfriend's apartment was pretty damn funny (note: this is attempted while his ex is still in the apartment).
His comment "We need to talk" while peaking out from behind the would-be stolen mattress is quite hysterical.
However, while NEW NIGHTMARE was a clever and original horror picture, HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD is anything but.
The problem, you see, is the following: the first half of the series (yes, even the 4th installment which most people dislike) were monster-movies - a mysterious box, a couple of evil looking beings that came with it, and a lot of unlucky people who came in contact with them - while "Inferno" and the rest have been turned into mind game movies, where people see things which may, or may not, be related to the box...  What we have in "Hellworld" is a genuine mediocre teen slasher: 5 young people, who were once dedicated players of the Internet based game "Hellworld" but are taking it cooler since the suicide of their fellow player, get invited to a big party.
We're in a perpetual state of not knowing what we're supposed to be concerned about until 80 minutes into the film, when instead of revealing the answers to the mystery by making connections in our mind for ourselves, we're dealt a five minute scene of the villain saying, "Let me explain my dastardly plan that's been going on for the last 80 minutes, that you as an audience were completely unaware of, while you watched random scenes that still don't make any sense or have any connection to the plot, even after I've explained it."
Lines of dialogue like this:  "You been away from the dark realm a while, Chels, how'd it feel playin' again?"
3) Did anybody notice in the beginning that van had a European license plate while driving and then pulled up with an imitation New York one?
Watch it while doing household chores so you can get stuff done.
Every once in a while, I'll see a low-budget independent "gay film" that is so lifeless that I am embarrassed for "my people."
The problem is that while Loretta thinks she's married to a high living salesman, she's really marrying a very high living gambler.
And to politely end my tirade, the one thing that annoys me more than the rest is how the show really takes only 10 minutes while the rest of the show just keeps cutting to characters faces repeatedly during seemingly tense moments.
(I love it when the woman and the security guard suspect a killer is in the multi-story building and the guard insists she stay in the lab with the door locked while he checks the place out, even though the door to the lab has a flimsy glass window on it).
The story then serves as a strict remake of the first one, with Anthony trapping the doll in a case, cutting herself while trying to grab the knife when the doll saws away at the case, and then becoming possessed by the spirit in the doll at the end.
Technically the film varies, some of it looks nice & colourful while at other times it's one of the cheapest, nastiest & most idiotic films ever.
Frank made deliberate choices to use violence while trying to recover money from the crime he was imprisoned for.
Bad guys' lawyer is finally testifying against former employers who both die in the most ludicrous final scene in the history of gangster movies: both choose to stand by the wide window panes while police is firing from below the street.
This is mainly because the Baku, basking in regenerative radiation all day long, have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out.
This is one of the most infuriating films I have watched in a long, long while.
(if you don't want to know the ending stop here).the main character,his ex fiancÃ©e and her lesbian girlfriend agree to stay together to raise their kids, and evidently while maintaining a 3 way sexual relationship!
The fact that the supporting cast included such venerable thespians as Ossie Davis (Judge Buchanon), John Turturro (Don Angelo), Lonette McKee (Lottie) and Joie Lee (Gloria), while featuring a fabulous soundtrack by Terence Blanchard should be a surprise to no one.
So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him, he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him.
We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film, and some of them are clear while others are not, unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance.
At one point in the movie, while bike riding together, Jack's brother gives him a bright, sparkling gem of advice Â get a vasectomy and call it a day.
Lee makes a valid point that while all the players involved in the burglary and subsequent cover-up went on to have lucrative careers as statesmen, authors, speakers and radio personalities, Wills died in obscurity.
And, after a while, I didn't care.
This is as deep and meaningful as gutters will allow it to rise, while an insight of Parisian lowlife drug smugglers, pimps and killers, there is just nothing to add to the narrative.
So while he goes on hoping for the best, he takes his best friend Mike (Freddy Rodriguez) around town looking for a job.
As I learned it, they are no good losers who drink and smoke while driving, and just get into general mischief instead of what they should be doing.
And while Jim does show some distress, Mike shows nothing but bewilderment.
Which after a while became quite boring, once you realize that's the only point to the movie.
I'm sorry- while I don't doubt the rejuvenating qualities of swapping spit with Ms. Longoria, I think its effect was slightly exaggerated, because I don't really think that it could eliminate the horror of killing your best friend.
As for Roland Culver, he ambles through this film as if he were on a golfing holiday, occasionally wrinkling his brow in order to suggest he may have thought of something, and once in a while uttering a platitude to remind us that this is a talkie (or perhaps to wake the audience up).
The film centers around a group of college theater students who decide to initiate new students by playing a prank on them while they are in the theater.
I also found Daguerre's jester irritating after a while.
In particular, while Robin's victory over Daguerre and Folcanet was accomplished, I was left wondering what was going to happen when King John (OK - Prince John) returned with his troops to collect the taxes.
Okwe's character is very superficial, while Senay has no depth at all.
This movie was really bad, I think that the title fooled me because I thought that there would be at least more vampire call girls and more of a vampire acting but what I got was a bunch of boring sex scenes including a girl straddling a washing machine while some goof with glasses watches through a peep hole, a lady at a club watching the most horrible band in the world play with a guy playing a guitar with only one note and then she takes him back stage, or vice versa and straddles the guy.
Problems in this film arise because there are loads of fights and most are from Don, while Mayid and the other leads have a lot less to do.
Apparently while you're playing it takes control of your mind so in case you hadn't already figured something similar, a virus gets into it and locks his mind inside the game so his Dad jumps to the rescue and the only way to free him is to complete every level according to Grandpa.
Somebody would have had to have coded a virus for this game while it was in production.
I caught a little deja vu while watching the film (as a kid my father owned similar west Indian type of restaurant in the bronx).
The plot, while it touches on the original story, sends you off course all the time with poor direction, and what to me, was obviously at best a pretty poor script.
this really got my interest for a while, until i realized that the captain didn't see anything, or whatever he did see we would never know.
There's nothing really good about the movie, but its still interesting (for a while).
To be fair for a short while I was quite taken with the sheer atmosphere of Sunshine.
(To override a mission saving action by the computer you need two people and security codes...) Once you raise it, although it turns off, in a while it will destroy itself, somehow.
I've been thinking about it for a while, and with seeing A Winter Tale, I'm very seriously contemplating this move.
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
Indeed, Jaspers is taken away and buried, while the girl calls a detective friend and is caught by the same guys before the cop arrives.
However, despite everything, it's worth a watch, even to laugh a while.
Here familiarity really does breed contempt, and while his Melody Jones character gets into some heated clinches with the alluring but otherwise out of place Loretta Young, in truth there's little other chemistry between them and you can't imagine her really throwing over the at least mildly dangerous desperado Dan Duryea, whose abilities are wasted here on an underwritten part, for slow-walking, slow talking Jones.
; the resolution, then, sees a happy ending for the Count and his companion â while Frankensteinâs well-deserved come-uppance is amusingly delivered over a game of pool by Merlinâs own hand.
That being said, SoD is not entirely without merit-it's great to see Nilsson perform "live" (he never did so during his real career) with an all-star band, and there is a clever scene where Harry puts the bite on a nubile young female while T.Rex's "Chariot Choogle" from his "Slider" LP is playing in the background (they even show Harry putting the needle on the record, which sports a T.Rex Wax  Co. label-unseen in the USA and very cool for this fan of not only Harry but Marc Bolan as well).
The plot of this film has a witch queen sending off a rubber suited monster thats controlled by a guy playing a magic flute off to kill people while the cops try to stop the mayhem.
The fact that it seems to go on and on forever doesn't help, and while I am as nostalgic for the late 1970's as the next guy one can at least take heart in the fact that human kind effectively evolved beyond a state where movies like this are possible.
As it is, one long car chase, punctuated by the kids thinking Arnold isn't such a bad guy after all while dad Paymer insists they "stop being nice to the criminal" (okay, I liked that part).
The studio broke one of the rules by employing children as main protagonists and while we don't have much in the way of animals we see another golden rule broken , the one that states " Never work with a duff script " .
Thornton Wilder's play about a matchmaking busy-body named Dolly Levi in 1880s Yonkers, New York who has been hired to find a mate for a wealthy, grumpy business owner; she comically attempts to keep him for herself, while the gal he admires is quickly falling for one of his own employees.
We kept watching this farce lurch from plot hole to plot hole while Burton did her best to lend it some undeserved dignity, but by the end we would have needed a forklift to keep suspending our disbelief.
Also, the rave was never rave-y enough, the music would always be soft while they were talking or they would be in the quiet room.
From what I've learned from this documentary all you have to do in order to be credited as a philosopher is point out something no one has noticed before as in " Fascists don't clap while Stalinists clap themselves " Hey Zizek might actually have a point until you watch an edition of FAMILY FORTUNES .
Frankly, while I would not condone it, I am surprised that there haven't been punches thrown in the direction of the hosts.
Most thematic elements here are actually missing, a more successful movie, while there is little truth, was The Curse of The Golden Flower.
Heck, she manages to ride her motorcycle while being chased by baddies without wearing glasses.
The film's theme about aging and living one's life while it's offered and on hand is of course important and surprisingly well-concentrated on in the script and practically the whole last part is about this and not about the killings anymore.
This grubby movie, the first of four, has slapper Robin Askwith having unprotected sex with numerous horny housewives on his window cleaning round, while his brother-in-law Anthony Booth cheats on his pregnant wife!
Peeling flock wallpaper and horrid furniture surround Sid and Timmy Lea in their council house while the apartments of some of the 'birds' whose windows they scrub are resplendently ghastly.
Joe Dalessandro and Sylvia Krystel were top sex symbols at the time "La marge" was made; the former still had the infamous Warhol trilogy stamped all over him , while the latter had found stardom a couple of years earlier with the legendary "Emanuelle".
And while Krystel seems to be laid back in a territory she is familiar with, Dalessandro is obviously nervous at times, the reason probably being that he CANNOT speak french!
The bet: The twisted minds believe they can kill this family before a certain time, while the family believes in survival.
Because while some people will criticize the film for being without any redeeming merits, others will praise the "originality" and the "daring" aspect involved in creating something so "deep and meaningful".
And while some film snobs will suggest that the film is "complicated" and needs a high intellect to enjoy, I say that it is too simplistic and predictable.
At one point a remote control is used to rewind the action that just happened while the audience is scolded for rooting on the heroine in a violent act that they would have booed for if the villain was the one with an upperhand.
But it's christmas so he comes to see his family, while picking up his wife at her firm, a group of terrorist shows up and holds all guests as hostages, John McClane manages to escape and is now the only hope to save the hostages and alert the police.
Peter is the younger and less confident of the two, while Paul -- played with chilling menace by the soft-spoken Michael Pitt -- runs the show.
The same opening overhead shot of a car (this time an SUV) driving down a desolate highway while the family inside plays a game of guessing opera tunes, opens the film.
(some spoilers) Ray Liota is the husband of a District Attorney who was killed while RAY was passed-out-drunk on the front yard of their house (and everyone thinks he did it).
John McClane, armed with only his police issue Berretta, manages to escape out the emergency exit while the terrorists are gathering up the others.
One amazing scene has him trying to tell McCarthy's  orphaned son a funny story about crows and an outhouse roof  while he slowly breaks down in grief.
Also there are more and more inconsistencies in the power of Peter Petrelli (replicating other's power) which is automatic when needed by the script (regeneration, be invisible, becoming radioactive etc..) and inoperative when really useful (replicating Sylar's powers at first, second or even third encounter, time travel from Hiro and so on) and not to mention that he never uses the ones he really need when he needs them (unlike Sylar), why did it take him the last episode to listen to anyone's mind (aside from the accidental encounter with Parkman), and why does he need his brother to fly him and play the firework while he can fly all by himself (his first ever duplicated power).
Quit while you guys made some money.
and, quite frankly, while i appreciate the attempt to set up the lives and moods of the characters, poorly executed homogeneous direction, coupled with the pitfalls of the initial premise provide the viewer with little more than a forced and crypto-pedantic show.
Unfortunately, while Patton was an outstanding general and administrator, he was a poor politician and the long knives in Washington found him an easy target.
After the slam bang opening the film grounds to a dead halt as babysitter Kane tries to get on with her life while detective Charles Durning tries tracking down the killer.
When i brought it home i began to watch it, and i have to admit the opening scene, while not as scary as i remember, still holds up as being a truly terrifying moment in the film.
Now while this would have been a good premise for a thriller in the drama section, it seems really out of place in the horror section.
But watching the film i wish i had been called by a "stranger" just so i could have had something to do while this sloooooooooooooow movie went on.
And while the ending scene did almost match the opening scene in its creepiness, the rest of the movie is not enough to make a viewer sit and watch the rest of the film.
While it is easy to get carried away every once in a while, if you have an ounce of self restraint it won't "ruin your life".
He hides out, and takes out the bad guys one by one, all while trying to get police attention from the outside world.
The group is led by Hans Gruber, one of the most interesting villains portrayed for a while and Alan Rickman's best role to date.
It is a shame that this show was made on the backs of the Canadian tax-payers while the art and animation department struggled to make the show funny and brilliant under the weight of poor scripts and even poorer management.
And the two start dating and whatever while Audrey watches from the side and she realizes that she's in love with him or something.
He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it).
After a while, I finally got annoyed with "Criminal Intent".
Actually, it was my wife who tried to help herself enjoy the film, while most I could do was delay my judgment and not ruin it for her.
We hated the clichÃ©s of stumbling on the floor while running, rivals fighting over a girl at a really bad time, and a teen couple leaving all the others to have sex while inside a ghost-inhabited hotel.
The title, while interesting, turned out to be irrelevant to the story.
The actors' acting, while not in a drama, can make you cry.
There's not enough action or character analysis here to make this film anything but an exercise from Miike, which while I'm sure was a good workout for him, leaves the viewer with little else to say, except it was kinda neat when the character's sprouted wings, a non too subtle metaphor for their rebirth as "heroes".
He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.
The Detectives where at the PD checking his moves by a satellite transmitter installed on his truck, and while the Detectives where talking the older one said they must let him go into Amber's so that he confessed to her his crimes, the younger one reply him and then suddenly the older one says they must caught him before he get her, contradicting himself previous parliament.
I've seen Man Behind the Sun and while I can't exactly say I 'enjoyed' it, it was shocking, powerful, and deeply disturbing.
If you've seen the original, just quit while you're ahead.
One sounds completely normal while the other guy sounds like he's yelling into his cupped hands or through a saltine box.
Terrible continuity, too-in one scene, a guy bites into a small corner of a guards earlobe while fighting, then we cut (they always cut away instead of going to the trouble of showing any sort of effect) to a shot of the guy with a huge chunk of flesh in his mouth.
Oh, and every once in a while, they stick in some stock war footage that is so grainy you can barely tell what's going on (I *think* that was a shot of something being blown up there...)  The characters look so much alike (I'm not saying this in a racist way -in the first movie, I had no problem, but here the screenwriting is so sloppy I didn't know who was who.
while the reporters would grab candlestick telephones and shout 'Get me Rewrite!'
Still, this climax reminded me of several much better films -- the musical 'Chicago', 'King of Comedy' and especially 'Sunset Boulevard' -- in which a delusional criminal basks in imaginary stardom while Justice closes in.
They even remember to make a feature film while they are there.
They meet Stanley, and go on a stupid adventure with him, while Gnorga is hot on their tail, and for some reason wants them all out of the picture.
So, this is important as a preserved record of their culture, but honestly, to me it became awfully dull and ponderous after a while.
And while I greatly admired the heroine, Charlotte's spunk (Jessica Chastain),she was no shrinking violet - the woman didn't hesitate to use a gun or a knife - she was so homely, she could have stopped a clock at midnight on a moonless night.
There were the numerous battles over ships, the ships he won through those battles, the smoking hat when he boarded a ship and the fact that he was caught in a sandbar in the Pamplico Sound while trying to flee from Lt. Maynard.
Meanwhile, the governor and his essentially second in command have been working with pirates for a while now and are willing to team up with Blackbeard so as to get their share of his prizes.
It takes a while to understand what's going on, but the build-up is quite good and is creepy, bordering on disturbing.
Karate Cop is a title that makes little sense, since while Richard Marchini knows martial arts and is a futuristic law enforcer, being that there is obviously no law in this phony futuristic scenario, can one still be considered a police officer, if you no longer have a public to serve?
I almost had a stroke during the scene where the Penthouse Pet (seriously) is tied to leather straps while a dominatrix whips her.
As strange occurrences and the feeling of an alien presence start plaguing a successful doctor's life, he suddenly gets trapped at the bottom of a well while a mysterious person who looks just like him takes over his life, including his house and his wife.
Apparently he hired actors from a certain local theatre to play the roles, and the approach they have to their characters is certainly very physical: the doppelganger and Rin snake around each other while making love, the way he cartwheels around to scare the brothers' mother, the level of distortion each character puts on their face in order to project their emotion.
I have never seen such a blatant attempt to pad out a movie in a while.
viciously pressed against his neck, while the impalement of a pair of oblivious lovers clearly rips off Mario Bavaâs far superior A BAY OF BLOOD (1971).
is notable, as are the Swinging London settings; incidentally, the hero is a Spanish actor appearing under the name of Vic Winner â similarly, his character is hilariously named Laurence Redgrave, while that of the Scotland Yard Inspector is Hawkins who has an assistant that goes by the name of Basehart!
In my opinion, a film starring Pauly Shore is going to be bad, however, while some of his films are good/bad (Encino Man), this is not one of them.
He is like a enclosure to Holmes, just sitting there and doing nothing, while Holmes is babbling on and on (he never babbled, he was a man of silent action).
Why did he do it - the spouses were feeding him, while his was hiding before moving to South America (he never had the chance).
It's downhill from there, folks, as Cubitt makes major changes in the story, such as tossing out important characters while creating entire chunks of business which add absolutely nothing to Sir Arthur's finely constructed plot.
He may not quite be the worst Holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst Dracula (in Van Helsing), but he's certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities, while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead.
With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.
Sadly, this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic, while marginally better than the dreadful Peter Cook and Dudley Moore spoof, is nonetheless a very poor show indeed.
But alas, I am clearly in the minority, this show has stood the test of time with countless re-runs on BBCtv, UK Gold, and while I stand to be corrected, even on Paramount Comedy.
She is told not to marry until her disease is behind her, so her longtime sweetheart waits in the wings while she treats her disease and hides it from him.
I had taped this off AMC during the 2002 Halloween marathon and finally had a chance to watch it and while it had the look and feel of a Hammer movie it was amazingly, painfully dull.
Beastly men and gorgeous babes were teamed up on one side of an island, while their opposite numbers lived at the other end.
The men of Goona had no strength, while the men of Wongo are hampered by poor eyesight.
So, while I've only rated The Wild Women of Wongo a 2/10, I'll give The Film Crew commentary a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
The mysterious doppelganger takes over the doctor's identity, his household, and his wife, all the while laughing and taunting down the well at his imprisoned twin.
I also learned one or two things while watching this movie:  -- Women are foolish objects.
All the couples start winking while looking STRAIGHT into the camera!
There are some hairy ape men like creatures who invade both the islands and it takes a while for them to come to a common plan of alliance.
I wonder also, why such rubbish is dubbed, while really good movies are only subtitled in Germany.
Easy-going so as to keep children happy, but most certainly if only about 7 years old, or if you are 97 years old and want to sleep for a while.
I must admit, I only caught the last 45 minutes and while I was working on my laptop but most older viewers will only need minimal conscious facility to assimilate this movie.
I felt that way while watching this film.
All the while, she has time to practice for a roller boogie contest with her boyfriend and blow away her fellow contestants.
I didn't give it a lower vote because with all its flaws it still entertained me for a while (it was a Sunday night).
The best I can say for it is that a bunch of kids and ninja fans probably watched it while drunk (or stoned) and cheered a lot.
However, if you're getting drunk before or while you're watching a film, there are literally thousands of terrible, terrible films that become enjoyable where they would otherwise be unwatchable.
The fatal shot is fired in semi-darkness while a distinguished audience observes the stars projected on the dome above them.
Back at home, the boys show their find to a local assayer while "Gus" fiddles with Sonny's chemistry set.
Forgive the histrionics while they flex!
Conscripted by a Witch (Yevdokiya Germanova) to collect some mystic artifacts needed to overthrow Munkar and in return win the hand of Princess Gretchen (Irina Grigoryeva), Kane battles stock villains while collecting his traveling companions.
For those thinking people who are interested in the subject, see "United 93," a professionally-made film that leaves out the melodrama, and presents the hard facts, while giving at least some insight to the mindset of Islamic Extremists, (and please remember that these extremists only account for about 10 percent of the Islamic World, as the majority of Muslims are deeply saddened and ashamed by these violent events.)
Whilst the Towers were still upright and smoking, somewhere in Hollywood, a movie exec's amoral mind was ticking over with shot angles and how to pitch this disaster as a theatrical release, while a television exec's mind was simultaneously projecting how much advertising time he could sell during a Movie of the Week based on this calamity.
The acting is particularly bad and while I'm not one of those who considers Blair a bad actress I think in order to keep working she had to accept roles such as this.
I've always been a huge fan of hers and while her role is horribly written she is still breathtaking to watch and the best scene comes as she's doing her nails by the pool.
You can probably put this in the "It's so bad it's good" category and while it's always easy to just say this is crummy it's still a film that's exactly what it advertises.
She promises her father she won't be "Cutting Class" while he goes on a hunting trip, or have brawny basketball boyfriend Brad Pitt (as Dwight Ingalls) sleep over.
They gave me something to do while I was waiting for this movie to end.
happens to be shot by an arrow while on a hunting trip.
There is a premise of boy thinking he has girl wrapped around his finger, while another boy decides he deserves the girl in question.
When Paula is left on her own for a week while her father, a district attorney, goes duck hunting, she promises to behave, but with rival friends fighting for her attention, the school principal (Roddy McDowall) perving over her ass, and a crazy murderer bumping off her schoolmates, staying out of trouble is going to be harder than she thinks.
It's taken me a while to get to this.
As for characters, I do not see a male character I like enough to want to be...And though there are some attractive females none of them seem very desirable after a short while.
There's a bus full of murderers that crashes while all this is going on.
The men run the show, make all decisions, while the women in true 1950's fashion, support their men- regardless of how many bad, ignorant decisions they keep making.
Having the camera slowly pan across paintings of Hell by Hieronymous Bosch while eerie music played was very effective and spooky.
Both Shatner and Borgnine are at their overacting best in this as they debate good and evil, while the black robed Satanists just sit around and chant; really, have you ever seen evil be so devout and boring?
On one level, in the present, it's a realistic, low key look at how some typical working class characters deal with disappointment and loss while poignantly cherishing memories of the more glamorous past.
A trio of nerdy sorority sisters (Linnea Quigley, Brink Stevens, and Michelle Bauer) are possessed by Succubi while holding a sÃ©ance with 3 fellow geeky guys.
The male hero Engor (Allan Nixon) discovers fire, while his buddy Kama invents the barbecue, even if by accident.
Basically Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) has his wife Rebecca (Kendall Cross) and son while eating lunch in a restaurant, when they were shot by a man who then shot himself.
Driving back to New York City, Cotten is involved in a freak accident while passing by a Georgia Chain Gang.
Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!
I cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes).
- The young lead actors, while charming, seemed confused and crippled by the badly paced and downright bi-polar script.
Davis becomes very good at searching for clues but Brent is in it to bag the story while getting the news before Garfield.
He sees a dead body, dripping of fresh blood, of the concierge while exiting the Paris hotel, and is now in fear for his life.
Either Amigorena thinks American characters cannot practice deep retrospection and emotion or Riley is really one of the most horrible movie actor's I've seen in a while.
Paris is a neon lit rain soaked city, while Venice is filmed from an intimate, non picture postcard point of view.
The pace doesn't start to pick up for a while.
Could it be possible that he might have swallowed some arsenic or something while no-one was looking?
The movie ends with Roscoe P. Coltraine threatening to impregnate a Swedish woman while her German father looks on.
The episodes were witty and funny, having jokes that people of all ages found funny while still keeping it innocent and clean.
Each episode was fresh and new, while still keeping it's old charm; but after a certain point things turned for the worse.
Ren and Stimpy, while vulgar and gross, was one of the most original ideas on the air.
I mean, you would think the baby crib dangler made of dead black crows would freak her out, but, no...she starts singing a lullaby she remembers from her childhood...all the while looking at a baby crib dangler made of dead black crows while being chased by a chainsaw killer...exactly how I'd react in that same situation!
Yeah, smash into a tree branch while showing your tits outside a vehicle's moon roof, that will cause your body to split in half!!
And the whole while he's doing it, it's like he's all calm, cool, and collected!!
Once in a while I manage to stumble across certain movies that, despite the cool box art, seem to go out of their way to appear unoriginal.
From, there they are killed off one by one by a deformed, psychotic madman and his wife while wandering through the house.
I was glad I was exercising at home while this mind-numbing piece of drek droned on and on and onÂ.
SPOILERS: 1.first off what was with frat boy not changing the flat 2.who closes the sunroof on there friends while they are hanging halfway out.
But, a little while ago, I got suckered into watching this on TV by a friend of mine.
As a straight man, I'm not very fond of 90% of men (most of them haven't got the heart, openness, and sensibility that I can easily find in many female friends), but the guy in this movie was extremely disgusting and is shown as a typical 1960s smug, self-opinionated alpha male who doesn't ask a woman once he has made up his mind, and who isn't interested in her thoughts, doubts or feelings (this being another ugly stereotype in this movie: a man doesn't have second thoughts, doubts or too much feelings, while women are so despicably weak that they consist of nothing else).
Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock "refrigerator moment".
Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has been long ignored by many, gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite.
I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch.
Paris Hilton (while stupid) is no dummy when it comes to money.
She laughs all the way to the bank while audiences in America continue to watch this.
ISLAND OF THE ALIVE is a very entertaining bad taste horror comedy , maybe not a classic like Peter Jackson`s BAD TASTE but still fairly good as the film opens with a woman giving birth in a New York taxi cab and a cop trying to shoot the new born baby , while the next scene features the knowingly stupid line " It took four bullets before it died - That`s some baby " , and of course there`s scenes of the mutant killer babies ( Done by stop frame animation , none of this CGI rubbish )going on killing sprees , and I haven`t even mentioned Michael Moriarty doing a great Al Bundy impression .
Personally,I didn't see a single boom shot in the whole extravaganza.There were some shots that were incredibly out of focus,but it turned out they were deliberate choices by the filmmakers.Parts of this film are actually wickedly funny,as all horror films should be.I couldn't help thinking though while watching this film that it might have actually been quite terrifying if the babies just looked like real babies!
With only two seconds to spare she tells the general that she has the boy and all he has to do to turn off the bomb is push one button while it took at least three to set the bomb.
The acting, while not horrific, is at least bad enough to put "Contagion" in the B- or even C-movie category.
In theory, it's a great idea for a black comedy: a school-kid calls a prostitute while his parents are away, and ends up running a brothel.
They are also somewhat unnecessary since they are based on Wilberforce narrating his life while pursuing a late-life romance that never existed in reality.
It seriously looks like some man just took his home video camera and filmed two kids staring at each other in a van and then every once in a while threw in a clip of a shiny knife with blood.
Out of the blue one day he says "I want you to eat my heart" and tries to justify it, she, I guess, says she dosen't like it and dosen't want to see him anymore (or they should not see each other for a while), but somehow he convinces her to kill him and eat his heart, why is never explained, neither is why he believes in this act.
At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock.
At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut.
Digital Film Tree's Founder Ramy Katrib stated the other night while presenting that the DV revolution has done nothing but put powerful creative tools in the hands of mediocre to horrible story tellers.
Like Trading Spouses, the families are completely different, but the problem is that instead of simply having the wife living with a new family the show tries to start a fight by getting each wife to read some sort of manual about the other family and then after a while to set rules.
He stood on the edge of the pipe for a while, and then just FELL in!
Don't worry, while some may call these spoilers, there's nothing here to spoil...
Keep the dog away from chocolate while it's on.
For a while I thought I was watching an episode of "Animal Planet".
It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her.
I eventually remembered how, but it took a while.
And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good-looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions.
Why anyone accepts this pigeon-holing is beyond me, but wondering about this isn't worth the time it takes for a synapse to fire, so ...  And while it's easy to see the above-mentioned no-names populating this production, it's quite disheartening to watch a veteran actor such as Jon Voight, who plays Meredith's father and school principal.
I don't recommend spending your money on it though; usually a TV station will show it every once in a while.
Obviously they have some sorting out to do on this matter while all are sailing back to America.
During propulsion testing, the Traveler phases in and out of 'our' time or reality and loses control of his powers while looking at Wesley (lost in thought), setting off an accidental burst of speed.
That being said, the highlight of the movie for me was the carwash scene where Eliza and Kirsten both were covered in soap-lather while wearing small bikinis.
The laborious scene where the cheerleaders audition a new member for their squad: the captain insists on the weird girl while the other cheerleaders complain saying the process is supposed to be a democracy, their corrected and told it's a "cheerocracy".
As a courtesan, Ms. Shue exhibits about as much ability to drive men to ruin as a stale baguette, while a rosy-cheeked, unwrinkled Ms. Lange delivers a studied, monotone performance relieved only by occasional lapses into a southern accent.
I thought this film would be about an aspiring white hip hop artist or rapper who was going through some reverse racism while he was trying to get his career started, and boy was I wrong.
The teens "party" at this frankly embarrassing event at which they have to pretend to be having fun while oblivious to the fact that there's only six of them there.
It also takes quite a while for the killing to start, because the makers of this vaguely likable crapfest thought it necessary to introduce us first to the utterly dull and unfunny humanoids.
This is a pathetically dreary film about a "gang" of drug smugglers and their not-so-funny misadventures as they are hounded by the Georgia State Patrol while first in a beat up camper and then a huge rig.
She quickly finds lodging in a hotel down by the harbour, but is forced to share a room with a sailor who works at night and sleeps while she is out in the day.
Taking a job as the man's office assistant, she soon becomes involved in a sort of relationship with him, while at the same time being intrigued by the sailor (Stipe Erceg), whom she only knows through the things left in their shared room.
I'd rather watch Ben Affleck and Jenny from the Block in that other awful movie that we dare not say its name, while watching it with Chinese voices dubbed over it and bamboo being shoved under my finger nails.
For while the miniseries was a remarkable - and important - piece of television, the book on which it was based has now been widely exposed as a historical hoax.
The main story is really just kind of going on in the background while a forced romantic story is developing...and the rest of the cast just enters screen to say their lines and walk off.
The black comedy/noir works for a while.
A pox on any who think this is worth while viewing material.
Some guy trying to push the boundary on how low his voice can go while recording it on a phone.
I watched it while sick, and it just lay there, so i thought, "why not?"
I tried, i seriously did, but i can't recount any part of the plot without curdling into a corner while crying, as my brain tries to exit my skull by digging it's way desperately through the back of my head, writing the script down on paper would summon chtulu, dropping the script in holy water would cause the water to boil, it is seriously THAT bad.
The movie follows a scientist who, while trying to cure HIV, actually is making a virus that creates vampires.
Also, could he not wait a short while before he decided to get together with the strange postal worker girl?
I am glad that I watched it at 2am on Saturday night while I did other things.
If you are bored one night, I guess you could leave it on while you do something else.
The good vampires live on a synthetic substitute to human blood while the rebellious ones go around murdering humans by drinking their blood.
Woodbine spends most of his time running around saying the 'F' word as many times as he can while Paul just looks bored, standing around with too much powder on his face and a glazed expression on his face, delivering every line with a dead-pan approach, it gets very tiresome after awhile.
The sets were awful, the usual run-down derelict building with lots of smoke and fog, minimal scenery involving a graveyard shot or 'people running through the forest while being chased by men with guns' visual.
When the director wants to make the action scenes 'dramatic', he thinks he can fool the audience by filming everything in slow-motion, while adding an 'echo' to nearly every word spoken in the dialogue - it just boggles my mind as to why amateurish garbage such as this still gets financed in today's economy.
That adds up to 200-odd minutes of watching five different stories, all while distracting you with camera gimmickry.
It didn't take more than two minutes for one of the horses to say (while eating a carrot, perfectly normal food for a PONY) that she couldn't wait until their synchronized swimming competition was over, so they could all go back to eating "normal food" again!!!
And lastly, while the history is substantially correct, there are enough errors or omissions to shove a stick in the spokes of any claim to authenticity.
The Nazis in Schindler's List are portrayed as evil heartless demons who seem to lack any kind of soul (well, Amon Goeth was pretty evil), while Schindler and other "goodies" are portrayed as saints with hearts of butter; It's time to wake up people!
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
Watching people stare at walls while soft music tinkles in the background is, well, kind of boring.
We have a brave "bone hunter" in search of Dinosaur Valley but all the poor guy can find is bad action/adventure movie clichÃ©s, like people sinking in quicksand, nude natives, plane crashes, Viet Nam vets, and knock-down drag out fights in piranha infested waters while bleeding.
There are a couple of nice ladies to look at but beyond that it's all pretty far fetched stuff that manages to be somewhat entertaining but wears thin after a while.
But one or two jokes made me smile a while.
Also no explanation why Melnicker dies while sitting alone on the sofa.
Counterfeiting while in stir, who'd a thunk it, the brothers Warner that's who.
Unless I`m imagining it there only seems to be one set used and the set designer hides this fact by using different furniture scene to scene ( I might be wrong of course ) while the werewolf make up is absolutely laughable .
Even the fights are pathetic, with stupid overuse of knives while they have big guns hanging in their backs.
They seem to be looking for this professor, but all the while they encounter child smugglers, gold hunters, and other bad-boys ruining the natives' way of life.
Protagonists driving around in 'monster' trucks...stealing amphibious aircraft...playing trumpets while canoeing down the amazon...sound terrible so far?
******* crappy spoiler *********************  Well basically the bad guy is on top of a train with the protagonists daughter suddenly his sister who died (as you find in the opening sequence) appears, which was pathetic, I mean for a while we thought he was some ghost then we realize he's really a man but now the movie has gone back to ghosts?
And while, yes, gratuitous nudity is common in these sorts of flicks, the kind they added here is just offensive.
Keitel is the FBI agent on the case and he and his wife MacDowell base themselves near the island of Ginostra, the site of the bombing, while he tries to pump the child for information.
I was watching it a while ago and I just couldn't stop laughing out loud during the whole thing, since it's just unbelievable the amount of nonsense and common places just one single film can come up with.
I admit I still watch portions from time to time and can actually feel my IQ lower while doing so.
The show is set up to more or less mimic a typical survival situation - lost at sea, lost while hiking, a plane crash in the wilderness, etc.
And then, to round up the usual clichÃ©d suspects, we have the nonthreatening, flaming gay guy Boris (Bruno Bichir) who offers secret, breathless advice to Zoe while confessing, around deeply effeminate giggles, that he finds her husband 'very hot'.
The husband carries on, living a gay lifestyle while he continues to live, and sleep, with his wife in an agreement that includes a 'fully loving' relationship.
Briefly, in this edition you find a progressive assimilation of each protagonist in the alien world while reading each different story.
He looks for the guy while on the phone but doesn't notice that our killer is not there(he was a suspect too) and goes on.
Silent Scream starts with one of the most annoying opening sequences I've seen in a while.
Forget about any blood or gore, just a few red splashes on curtains, clothes & walls & while watching the end credits I noticed there wasn't any special effects credit listed which tells you everything you need to know!
A handful of ships with the last humans trying to find Earth while escaping killer robots.
In the end, while the premise remained solid, the story lines faltered and became a bit campy (space angels?
Two characters, one barely seen, suddenly became "angels", while another was turned into a "divine creature", without even the most basic explanation.
The whole epilogue for the characters was a disaster, pulling the "emotional strings" while throwing logic out of the window.
He also wants Bryan to stop lying to him and once in a while actually show some responsibility.
11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.
There's also a hysterically stupid monster that pops up every once in a while to rape and kill the native girls.
Oddly, while shocking, the group at first seemed to take this in stride--I guess they didn't want to pass judgment on quaint native customs.
Then it's off to the beckoning town of Silverado, where Paden finds the bar of his dreams while the others are reunited with family.
Mia Farrow takes the lead role and while she is undoubtedly an excellent actress; she isn't able to elevate this drab material much above the bottom of the barrel.
The Haunting of Julia does not benefit from an interesting atmosphere either, as while some attempt is made to build one with a musical score; it never really comes off.
The plot, such as it is, concerns the women being ill-treated by the Captain of the guards who demands sexual favors of them while man-handling them brutally.
Also the plot concerns them doing sewing in what is supposed to be sweat shop conditions for virtually no pay, while the man who re-sells the items is making a big profit.
I was excited when I saw that VH1 was going to air this movie, and kept an open mind while watching, knowing that no biopic ever gets it all right, and since I know more about the subject than the average viewer, I didn't want to judge too harshly.
I would not want my children learning anything from a guy who spouts bible verses while hurting people.
A wealthy Bruce Wayne-ish man played by Willie Aames (who did not age well; hard to believe that he was once a teen idol) going through a crisis of some kind decides to dress like a cross between Robocop and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars and fight wussy villains with light-sabers while spreading the word of God.
Those will definitely entertain kids while teaching them the Bible at the same time.
Bibleman noted that he should have seen through it because the robot has two blue eyes while the real person has "one blue eye and one green eye, as an unfortunate result of his hereditary lineage."
Miles Peterson, a suspicious knockoff of Bruce Wayne, fights embodiments of human nature, while hosting an often-targeted youth group.
But while Cronenberg's vision of picture postcard Medford, Indiana is archetypically American enough (though actually filmed in Canada), his villains are pure central casting stereotypes.
Gangster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is such a trite caricature that when he shows up out of the past to confront Stalls, you expect him to step out of his black limo wearing a pinstriped suite and a white fedora while carrying a violin case concealing a tommy gun.
He seems intent to do what has become the norm, subtly glamorize violence as a commonplace impulse in a mundane world, simultaneously pretending to condemn brutality, while giving it backhanded approval as part of the norm.
He runs around fast a little bit, juggles to himself while beating on the Trickster a bit, but doesn't really do anything cool.
I've been anticipating this film for a while, ever since it got such buzz at SXSW 2007 (and I missed the screening).
Robert Redford was a thoroughly believable CIA analyst with a background that allowed him to elude assassination while developing a believable relationship with Faye Dunaway whom he kidnapped at random to aid his escape.
After a while there's just blabbering going on and you don't even care who's who and who's working for this one or that one and he has conflict with him because of someone else's agenda blah blah blah.
Now I remember why I said I would not be going to the movies for a long while.
As a movie, it was entertaining but all the while this ate at me.
Memo to the lazy DP- try switching lenses every once in a while.
And the script, while containing some witty and "daring" (yawn!)
Moreover, the picture just freezes at a random point, while the counter keeps running, then the disc ends (cuts off, rather) a minute or so later.
Talk about the need for acting classes and while we're at - directing classes or a whole new 4 year degree at another film school.
As far as the nude scene by the two guys, while it was gratuitous I say why the hell not?
It is what is and while it didn't add anything to this film or speak highly of the director's creative acumen it at least is a step in the right direction for the male form in cinema.
After some brief introductions, the foursome decide to have sex and it is during this scene (or perhaps a later sex scene - my memory fails me here so cut me some slack) that said Wimpish Man appears from behind a plate-glass window and proceeds to watch for a while.
As is the case whenever two people fall in love, Masturbating Woman returns to the villa for a nap while Aristocrat continues wandering aimlessly across the beach.
This turns them on so much that Stern-Looking Woman kneels over the bed and begins stabbing Masturbating Woman repeatedly, which affords Wimpish Man the opportunity to mount Stern-Looking Woman from behind while the Mistress masturbates off to the side.
There are some real unpleasant scenes in the film, and while this might have pleased some people; they are not done very well at all and a scene that sees a man kill a dog, for example, looks incredibly fake and stupid.
Franco successfully builds their scenes, starting with the eye-contact between Odile and Mario's wife, while we also see that Odile ogles Mario, from their hotel windows..an opportunity is presented, and we watch as Mario's wife makes the first move.
The other women rush over and start hitting him, then sexually abusing HIM, all the while shouting at him to stop raping them.
Go out and rent something worth your while.
It is so atrociously bad that it even makes you angry while watching it.
Thomas seemed and felt unfocused in this film giving us not enough in one area, while completely destroying another.
Watching this movie made me remember that I didn't have to settle for whatever actors I could scrape out of a trailer park, a DP who had no experience outside of a Polaroid camera and sound recorded on an answering machine while the freaking actors phone it in.
Because Mr. Dylan seems more interested in getting smashed out of his skull on something or other while Lennon - no stranger to drugs himself though much more composed on this occasion - comes across as cool, while his co-passenger Mr. Dylan is slurring his words, making little sense, and gradually becoming so ill to the point of needing to vomit into the camera.
We see some people standing along a road, when D.A.Pennebaker makes a fast pan, cutting to another fast pan to Dylan and Manuel, climbing the fortress of Kronborg, while a dog is barking.
Peter Mullan is superb as the Mayor, convincingly essaying the kind of man who can rule an entire town by sheer force of will alone, but while you understand his emptiness, the film never allows you to feel for it, leaving the finale a rather empty spectacle rather than genuine tragedy.
Unfortunately the supporting performances are rather dull and characterless: Nastassja Kinski has little to do but waste away, Sarah Polley isn't able to do much with her cardboard good girl, Milla Jovovich lacks the moxie her saloon manger cries out for while Wes Bentley tries to coast on charisma without ever having enough to do the trick.
Cabot makes a slick villain while the supporting cast includes such familiar faces as Travers, Fowley, and Bond.
Even while trying to recover an extremely poor script with above average actors, this movie is a bomb.
The film's got a lot going for it -- wisecracking script, bright colour, great music, and moments of sudden shocking darkness amid a generally easy-going plot -- but while it's pretty good, it isn't Errol Flynn's finest hour, and it isn't among the greatest Westerns either.
while i didn't mind the original The Shaggy Dog(1959),i thought this sequel was not too good.i found it way too silly and absurd,and not realistic.by that,i'm not talking about the premise,a man transforms into a dog.that i can accept as being within the confines of the movie.what i found unrealistic was how most of the characters acted and or reacted.too say there was some overacting going on would be a massive understatement.i also didn't find the characters endearing.i did however find them annoying.and the acting in general was unimpressive.and i found the ending abrupt with no real resolution.i'd say this would be a good family movie,a family comprised of only 3 year olds.maybe they ran out of money or time.whatever.this film had none of the fun or charm of the original.for me,The Shaggy D.A.is a weak 3/10
Too often he relies on cheap gimmickry, be it Jean-Pierre Marielle's gay private eye who has never solved a case or the old 'image caught on dead person's retina' plot device, while the main character treads water.
), and while the horror set-pieces are often vividly realized - most notably, the scene in which Brandon's blackmailing maid (Marisa Fabbri) finds herself trapped in a lonely park with the killer, a sequence which refers backward to a similar scenario in Jacques Tourneur's THE LEOPARD MAN (1943) and forward to John Saxon's final sequence in Argento's TENEBRAE (1982) - the pace is labored and dull, especially during expository dialogue scenes.
Mimsy Farmer makes a fair impression as Brandon's nervous wife, while popular Italian character actor Bud Spencer (Carlo Pedersoli) plays Brandon's closest friend, a bad-tempered fisherman who helps him solve the unfolding mystery.
All in all, a minor entry in the director's filmography, elevated to mythic status by legal problems which have prevented its appearance on home video, and while the film exercises a gamut of stylistic concerns (Argento followed it with an unlikely detour into historical comedy, FIVE DAYS OF MILAN, before cutting loose with his giallo masterpiece DEEP RED), it amounts to little more than a footnote in horror history.
Errol Flynn looked far more at home with a sword than a six shooter, but, while not John Wayne, he's fine here as the goodguy cowpoke pressed into service as Sheriff when things in Dodge get a little too nasty.
The movie sticks to that for a little while.
Three stupid and obnoxious teens burn an American flag on Sam's funeral plot, which somehow makes him return to life as a ghoul (the make-up is actually pretty good) who offs non-patriotic people while dressed as the title character!
An awful film with some hilarious scenes, like when the family is on the table and enjoying their breakfast together, while the coffin of the dead Uncle is in the same room.
Anyway, this documentary by Nick Broomfield focuses on (for a while) friend rappers Tupac Shakur, murdered in 1997, and Biggie Smalls (Christopher Wallace, the Notorious B.I.G.
Hatton is ably assisted by his sidekick, Rusty (Alan Hale), who acts as deputy and backs up Hatton in all his fights, while he is sheriff and before.
One night while in my local video rental outlet I settled for "Dead Boyz Can't Fly" because reviews touted it as the "Clockwork Orange for the 90's," one of my favorites, I thought it might be another "Warriors."
The husband of Raynelle Slocumb (Whoopi Goldberg) suddenly kicks the bucket while eating breakfast at the kitchen table.
"Kingdom Come" is a movie obviously driven by moral beliefs and powerful conviction, and while its intentions are noble and understood, it never manages to get its point across clearly.
Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are growly and great villains, while comedy relief comes in the fine form of side-kickers Alan Hale and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams.
It lingered around for a while and didn't smell too good.
The great howler in this film is that Astaire is supposed to be drunk while doing two incredible dance numbers.
And all the while this old hearse keeps showing up on the roads or in her driveway.
The film wouldn't have been quite so bad if we'd been provided with a bit of eye candy, but while she's not ugly - lead actress Trish Van Devere really didn't do anything for me.
This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedian  The movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film worked  This film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comedies  The comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice one  Direction by DD is bad Music is okay  Akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
She finds out more about Manuel her husband while he is away one night and gets scared.
On the flip side, you have lazy, untalented hacks who desperately want their films to be viewed as cult classics and think they can accomplish this by making everything as loud, vulgar and obnoxious as humanly possible while populating their already annoying movie with jerks and weirdos who scream moronic comments at each other from beginning to end.
She goes home, he follows her, gives her a painting of a unicorn, basically makes an ass of himself and runs home crying while some horrible cover of the horrible song "Bang a Gong" plays over the credits.
The four lesbians then head out on some sort of vacation and basically prove to be boring, unlikable bitches on the way to their rented lakeside cabin while another horrible cover (this time of "Radar Love") plays.
So the guys break in, overact, scream and act like obnoxious attention-starved cretins while holding the ladies at gunpoint and forcing them to do things they don't like, such as cleaning up a puddle of puke on the floor.
And making out and rubbing up against each other while covered in blood.
also there is a scene where a feminine dude literally cries (while running) at the camera for five whole minutes and you my mouth was open the whole time in shock.
I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I've seen in a while.
After the threesome, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front, listen, and smile evilly into the camera.
This guy's claymation art, while skillfully done and painstakingly detailed, is truly disturbing.
And the method of murder dealt differs somewhat from ELEPHANT , a car bomb in a street of Saturday shoppers was a favourite with republicans while capturing an innocent passer by and torturing them to death with a stanley knife and red hot poker was a common practice amongst loyalists .
It started off pretty slow and while it introduced some very interesting characters, the story line lacked big time.
They learn respect while knowing each other's secret.
This documentary is fundamentally misleading in its characterization of the "split" that divides Americans politically by focusing almost exclusively on relatively meaningless "hot button" issues like abortion and homosexuality, while ignoring real class, gender, and racial disparity.
Moreover, it was even more propitious that they happened to have all their high tech surveillance, radio and radar equipment with them while they were bow hunting.
The mockumentary "Farce of the Penguins" is obviously an attempt to cash in on the success of "March of the Penguins" while at the same time making fun of it.
Since then, for quite some time, I've been aware of the title, "Farce of the Penguins", but didn't see it for a while.
However, Carl and Jimmy's friendship gets awkward after Jimmy accidentally has sex with Melissa one night in the dark while she is asleep and he feels something soft!
Some of these comedies can be described as crude, juvenile, and FUNNY, while some can only be described as crude and juvenile.
But considering there isn't much amusing about penguins in the first place, Saget couldn't do much to make it funnier than the thoughts everyone with any sense of humor whatsoever was thinking while watching March of the Penguins.
Another example is how some of the clips blatantly reverse themselves to stay on screen while the actors talk.
The penguin footage had so little to do with what the comics were saying most of the time that it just got stupid after a while.
One thin finger taking on her attacker's entire iron hand while naked in a mud pack and "mmmmphing" into an anesthetic pad.
It was one of those film that while watching it you realize, oh my god, there was no effort at all put into this film
The other boy has to dig the hole to bury it in while this is happening.
4) The boys, as teenagers, are running away from home to go to LA and 'make it big'and while they are waiting for a ride at the side of the road, Mom pulls up to give them a bag of money she's managed to sneak out of their father's bank account.
5) Eliot gets knocked out by a gang of Nazi skinheads while symbolically throwing away his bag of prescription (and non-) narcotics and is then taken in for the night by a haggard homeless man casually toting a rifle.
and finallyÂ   8) not an implausibility, but yet another ridiculous inanity: When Eliot goes to Tom's dad's house to visit the old man (Mom died while the boys were in LA), they have a kitchen conversation during which the old man is framed by the camera standing in front of a canvas of the 'Our Father', and Eliot is framed in front of a canvas of Jesus on the opposite wall.
while at times the scene is funny, overall it's pretty drawn out and boring and the big 'reveal' at the end isn't all that funny and is basically a cop out to end the scene.
Linda Fiorentino plays a sad caricature of her character in "The Last Seduction", while David Caruso pulls off a pretty decent performance.
Young Fievel Mousekevitz the mouse gets lost again (for a little while) and then decides to try and get rid of all the cats from the West part of America, where the story left off.
I remember being bored out of my mind while watching this (as a child).
And while they got the history right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejecting pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen.
And while Careful looks quite good--though the tinting is at times oversaturated--his insistence on having his cast read the script in an arch deadpan style is simply annoying and frankly an insult to the films to which he is supposedly paying tribute.
Ashore, they put on a dancing spectacle for the crew, who are drawn into romantic relationships with the natives while living on Tahiti when the Bounty is at anchor.
Yet while there are eager visitors to this nearly inaccessible spot, with a harbor that only the trained inhabitants can navigate, there are drawbacks.
They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking "pay-dirt" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise.
It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.
In the first part, alien Meeko is endlessly tortured and mutilated by American scientists while his pal Nukie wanders around South Africa and mutters.
In the third part, Meeko is first hypnotized by, then befriends a talking computer, while Nukie disco dances.
It consists primarily of a disgusting little alien rushing around the desert, while his brother shrieks NUUUUUKEEEEEE approximately fourteen thousand times.
I'll leave you with a bit of the wit from this movie; while the scientists are taking miko's pulse with the x-ray machine, they still don't know whether he's an animal, mineral, or vegetable.
Honestly, when I finally finished this movie I felt like dying(it took me a while because I watched about the first half hour and needed to stop on account of the utter idiocy of this movie).
They must avoid an American chopper pilot working for NASA (watch out - he's a `player'), local poachers, and a pesky nun (Glynis Johns) while they do so.
A few of the Keystones display a degree of finesse and are well worth watching (I'd put THE STAR BOARDER and THE NEW JANITOR on the short list of Charlie's more enjoyable early works), while others are of interest only to Chaplin buffs determined to see all his work, even the scrappy and incoherent stuffÂwhich brings us to LAUGHING GAS.
Typical gag: Charlie, pretending to be the dentist while his boss is away, flirts with a pretty young patient, then takes a pair of pincers, pinches her nose, and yanks her face over for a kiss.
I get the sense that they might have run out of time while making this episode and had to cut things out, since a lot of plot threads are abandoned.
The movie should have stayed true to the book wherein the first scene started with the Muggle Prime Minister being introduced to the new Minister of Magic and while he was being told about the ministry and how resent catastrophe were magic related....scenes o death eaters destroying the bridge, etc should have been background scene and not, not what was shown in the movie.
Events such as Harry and Dumbledore's quest for Voldemort's Horcruxes are barely touched on, while the majority of the film focuses on the sillier parts of the novel such as the growing hormones between the sixth year Hogwarts students.
WHY for the love of all that's holy, did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes?
Harry just stars under the floor, while Snape kills Dumbledore.
The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.
Sure there is nudity from the two stars (Cherri Caffaro and Jocelyne Peters) and while the ladies aren't quite ready to make up half the Golden Girls sitcom even Mr. Magoo wouldn't mistake them for nubile.
The other guy in the scene was producer Sandy Cobe who wasn't an actor and couldn't really handle yelling while imagining loud music.
Cheryl Campbell is sometimes irritating as Lady Brent, while James Warwick is adequately convincing as Jimmy Thesinger.
Olivier Gruner fails to impress the viewer as the protagonist Caution Templer, a lawman who must defend himself from attackers while investigating the mysterious death of his brother (also a lawman) on the Martian outpost Alpha City.
This was shot on DV(as opposed to film or HD), and while the film does show, I think they did fine with this format, one I myself have had the pleasure and good fortune of working with.
Over the last little while, I have been catching up with Mr. Allen's work, both on and off-screen and he not only seems to be an impressive actor, but an amazing human being.
I might go back again and watch another minute of the movie later, while I'm having a cigarette....or maybe it's time to stop smoking...
Like THE THING meets THE SHINING while falling flat on its ass?
Of course, I couldn't help myself longing to re-watch 'But, I'm a Cheerleader' while viewing 'Save Me.'
Though two different genres Â 'Save Me' is hard drama, while 'Cheerleader' is strictly comedy Â they both present the same premise: unwilling homosexual participants admitted into a "Go Straight for God" isolated home.
Working along side her is Dr. Dane(Marjoe Gortner), who wishes to help the patients, while Fletcher seems to enjoy them for homicidal kicks.
In fact this film has a lot of nudity in it with a cat-fight in the showers and a mud bath as standouts...anyway,...ah the mind wanders...Susan is being stalked by the man that killed her mother all the while learning about the atrocities committed by Dr. Fletcher.
But make no mistake, while outwardly a horror film, this is also a sexploitation film equally.
Mad Foxes is just as ridiculous as it's meant to be and then some...however, while I enjoy a good silly flick, the inconstancies and illogical nature of the film don't help it as the plot doesn't move well at all, and the film gets confusing too often, which isn't good when the plot is as simple as the one here.
In fitting with the rest of the film, the acting and the dialogue are both terrible; but the film is very funny on numerous occasions, and while I can't say I overly enjoyed Mad Foxes; it might appeal to those who enjoy seeing movies at their worst.
Apart from the fact that the 'shock' of the fight wears off after a while, having a battle scene that takes up 75% of the film's run-time leaves no room for character development - and hence you could not give a monkeys who lives or who dies.
Their appearances are accompanied by sinister Arab techno, while the US forces are trailed by violins, oboes and vocals inspired by Enya.
This movie has been clearly aimed at a different market, at a public that consumes tons of popcorn and chats on mobiles (cellphones) while watching a movie.
I was going to wait until a second viewing of CASINO ROYALE before writing a comment for it since my opinion on a film occasionally does change the second time around, but I am absolutely stunned at the positive rating of the picture so I feel I must get my two cents out while my grips are fresh in my mind.
We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine.
It wasn't exciting, the jokes were groan-worthy (although after a while I even gave up groaning), the plot was.. well there didn't seem to be one, being more a selection of scenes thrown together with no reason behind them.
maybe it is because he is coming from an alcohol addiction background and is more accepting, while she is trying to make amends for driving away her son without really understanding that love exists in all forms, straight or gay, and that acceptance of others is the only truly Christian way of living.
He stops to pick up his friend Timmy Ainley, but Timmy has the sniffles and must stay home with his mother (Rosemary DeCamp) while Mr. Ainley (Ray Milland), a professor of English at the local college, thinks the sniffles are being faked to avoid a math test.
Hodiak's discomfort builds toward angry jealousy while Milland's drinking gets out of control (don't expect a rehash of "Lost Weekend"; the boozing here is mild in comparison).
Thank god this is one of those movies that you have to stumble across while channel surfing late at night (and hopefully drunk).
French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on "Third Rock from the Sun", while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature.
I thought the scene you culled from your home movies with him scorching his toe while practicing fire-breathing was a real cute kick!
A mass of crystals with a very small lizard (he looked about 2cm long while hurdling through space) looking vaguely like you lands on your island home and disrupts your family life, imprisoning your son and committing other rude acts.
I am an ex-Christian who, while never having done the whole "ex-gay" scene in my church years, have held nothing but contempt for the movement and the promises it makes.
The story is a beautiful discussion of both the goodness and healing qualities of the Christian faith, while also exploring the brittle, rigid quality that faith by rules brings to the table.
One scene, not a spoiler, shows Duvall's character trying to negotiate a flight while much grass is being unloaded.
Being neither American or particularly patriotic, 'Old Glory' was never going to have much of an effect on me and, while I do recognise it as a handsome piece of animation, it's a misfire in the entertainment stakes.
Hangar 18 stars Gary Collins as one of three shuttle astronauts who see a UFO in space while attempting to launch a satellite.
For example - while on the run, Gary Collins seems, under any circumstances, to be able to find a car with keys in the ignition and an owner who doesn't really care if he steals it.
Overall, it largely plays like amateur fanfiction, overusing the surface strengths of the originals (namely L's eccentricity) while losing its deeper strengths.
Even Death Note veteran Kenji Kawai's score, while certainly not bad, is a far cry from his work on the previous films, though largely because he's mostly forcibly limited to low key background music and the long periods of sluggish silence Nakata so adores.
Martin is a strong, capable actress who should be commended for this attempt to broaden her capabilities, but the film's budget is low and the script, while well-meant, is full of tired clichÃ©s (updated clichÃ©s for the 1980's).
If you watch the director/actor/producer interviews on the DVD you will find out that they shot it over 8 days on break while the director was making ju-on, this makes sense as they spent no time developing this movie and one has to wonder why they bothered at all.
But Jerry has stowed away inside the picnic basket and does everything he can to torment him while scoffing the food for himself.
There are some very funny painful tricks played on Tom, but they do get a little tiresome after a while.
He brings her home and begins to study her animal-like behavior while his life takes a bizarre turn for the worst.
At one point, Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act.
While I will admit that the plot held my interest for a while, it was largely due to the poorly handled time travel logistics (which are ultimately explained/explained away).
Poaching is a blight upon the face of civilisation & anyone who buys or uses ivory should be forced to work on an anti-poaching patrol for a while, as many of my school friends (black & white) did.
It is hard to like a movie when the story is unremittingly violent and barbaric while the characters are cold and (Donovan excepted) unappealing to look at.
Just like the TV series "Lost", it seems all exciting while you watch and wait anxiously for the ending, which is supposed to explain everything, but when it ends, nothing is explained.
Some scenes looked like the camera crew accidentally left the camera running while the actors were just goofing off.
Also knowing that Super Sayain already existed while I watched this movie, made Kaioken just seem a stupid technique.
"Killer Fish" mixes a heist movie while cashing in on Joe Dante's "Piranha".
Also, while Bette Davis is in the movie, she's largely given an unremarkable and bland role.
And because the story lines are convoluted and intertwined, I can't just watch it once in a while and enjoy it either.
One of the AmericansÂa leading newspapermanÂdies from a mysterious fall while the other vanishes into the ocean on his voyage to San Francisco.
The I Inside is a complex movie and while some may dislike it for it's complicating story lines others may just because of it.
and during the movie Dudikoff is tied to a hood of a car, while Hamill drives, Gersak screams and Hamill twitches in front of the camera while Robert Mitchum cashes an easy paycheck as he barely looks at the camera as he plays Hamill's doctor.
In fact, what he did deliver to the powers at Dreamworks was an absolutely terrible comedy of horrors that undoes everything in the previous movie while simultaneously making the audience wish that they themselves were drowning in the bottom of that damn well.
Unfortunately, while her performance is bearable up until the climax (and definitely not during the climax), her character is so freaking stupid it's amazing she doesn't die in the first five minutes.
Watts seems to be catatonic through most of the film, with a range that goes from confused to pretend-scared, while her overly-pancaked son Aidan played by young David Dorfman seems both possessed and cardboard all in the same go.
If one likes B horror with the obligatory semi-nude scenes, flimsy plots and a little gore, this might be worth your while.
It, of course, manages to elude capture and bullets and just about everything else, and the professor, while talking to himself the whole time, manages to kill everyone but the girl and they ride off into the sunset, sort of.
Anyway, this gets her white trash boyfriend all hot, & while he's having his way along comes our monster & cuts in.
The truth is, while every shot WAS taken in the arctic, and was NOT staged, the characters Nanu and Sela were "composite characters" comprised of MANY different animals that were filmed by the directors over their time in the arctic.
The sound is also poorly edited, and, while I can not be SURE, I would guess that many of the sounds did not occur as shown in the film (pull my flipper??!!)
It's even fine if the audience doesn't for a while, but I find it incredibly annoying to invest a couple of hours into a story only to find out in the end that it was all just a dream.
Also the kids were trained by a Van Damn wannabe who while solidly built lacked any acting talent.
I have seen other movies like this before like the movie dead end,but I thought the ending of the I inside was more real.He was either in a coma for 2 years and while under imagined all the scenarios of bettering his life and making up for the people he wronged,or was stuck in hell tortured with never ending memories of what he did while he watched with his own eyes the sins he committed.And his guilt was making him see how he would change things if he had another chance.
They will usually go over-the-top when "pimping" the car, adding at least 4 TVs per car and other expensive and unneeded items you would not use while in your car.
Another thing that bugged me was that the premise of the movie was this group of people stuck in a house (which may or may not be haunted) all the while being recorded and streamed on a website.
All of this would be enjoyable had Death Before Dishonor contained some punch in the action sequences but unfortunately these one sided action sequences feature a three digit body count on one side, while only one good guy dies.
DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR is the kind of film where multiple bad guys can't hit the hero (granted his underlings do die for the cause) with machine guns, but he can blow them up with a rocket launcher while driving a car.
It was depressing to see her standing there nodding while holding the suitcases.
Disaster is staved off for a while by Swanson's energy, Donald Sutherland's ability to keep a straight face, and Paul Reuben's touching conviction that he's in a funny film.
There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part.
Eden's partner ends up getting knifed as he cuffs the guy while winking at her (saucy!
The fact that Simon, the main protagonist, is dead at the end of the movie is not a clue to the story, it's rather the RESULT of the different choices he makes while time-travelling to the past.
Simon starts out in hospital in 2002, being a victim, presumably of inhaling poisonous fumes while working in the house (but it is also suggested that this might be a poisoning attempt by his wife Anna).
The significant thing is that he was in the same hospital in 2000, after the (rather unintentional) murder on his brother, and the car crash he got involved in together with his nearly dead brother (presumably while on the way to the hospital).
Almost anything that happened, could have happened in a different way if the protagonist would have made different choices while travelling to the past.
The film's opening sequence is actually quite good and points towards the fact that it's an adventure film, while the following boring half an hour points towards the love drama.
At the cinema I was sitting next to some teenagers that obviously was waiting for the great battles, and while waiting they were talking and "play fight" with each other.
Like when Banta gets stuck in the aliens' sticky web and the guys sit around for two days debating whether to go try to rescue her, all while they can clearly see from afar that the aliens are trying to conduct experiments on her.
To this film's credit it has some decent atmosphere and once in a while lives up to its title.
Pass on this film, people, it will make you want to beat your head off a couple of rocks and then stick your head in a microwave while you sit on a grill, because this movie is utter crap!
Avoid this one if at all possible and rent the original instead; at least its camp is somewhat entertaining, while the remake just disappoints.
I couldn't help but wonder what JoBeth Williams and Craig T Nelson felt while making this sequel, an obvious decline in all areas from the first film, from the rather embarrassing plot to the dialogue they are forced to endure.
The antagonist is a giant mechanized whale/shark creature while the main character, Joshua, and his people navigate through their sky world in highly stylized mechanical blimps.
Mystery channel (and not until January 2005), while a film like Alone in the Dark (2005) has a major multiplex release across the country makes as much sense as leaving the Ferrari at home and cruising the strip on a tricycle instead in an attempt to impress the chicks.
It's even more complicated than that, as when he's playing the character in the previous temporal setting, he has to be two characters at once--the character as he was when that temporal setting initially occurred, and the character from the later temporal setting experiencing it again, as a voyeur, while piecing together the puzzle.
In some scenes, skin tones are posterised and macro-blocked, while the grain-like compression effect known as mosquito noise sometimes runs rampant.
As far as performances go, Campbell Scott is solid as always, but his efforts here, while commendable, are ultimately an exercise in futility.
This film stands out while looking at the DPP list of Video Nasties due to its wacky title.
Once again, we get Waldemar Daninsky being bitten by a werewolf while on an expedition in Tibet.
But, her father, once a great dancer himself, with a New York company, is confined to a wheelchair while her mama drinks too much.
Donnie Darko is a beautiful, thought-provoking film, while this movie just falls flat.
Even poor Richard Bremmer didn't look good trying to act while using that rotten Russian accent.
The overall impression of this version of Crime and Punishment is much more different than what I saw in my mind while reading the book.
There was no notable action: the main characters were in a big investigation, full of dull dialogues, and the creature was just wandering around in the sewers doing some cheap kills once in a while, nothing too original, entertaining or gory.
The creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive.
This movie is possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen, as the first one is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time i have been bitterly disappointed twice so far !please save yourself the same heart ache and just watch the first Starship Troopers again while imagining in your own mind the endless possibilities they could of embraced to build open, then if you really must, watch the second and third films and see how it was completely and utterly screwed up.
The nude scene(while yes, there were nice looking bodies) just seemed totally tacked on and had no plot barring whatsoever.
But after a while, I desperately felt an urge to get out from it & eventually it took quite a few days to get back to my normal system.
Unfortunately the only gag was the reflex I experienced while watching.
Unfortunately the only gag was the reflex I experienced while watching.
I kept wishing I had learned how to darn socks for fun and profit when I was younger, so I might have accomplished something constructive while viewing this moo-vie.
The author's phobic attitude toward the "Boston Marriage" of the two heroines seems to mirror that of the southern chauvinist Basil Ransom (which is offputting) and the book never quite recovers from thoroughly humanizing the doomed females while setting them up to be trounced by the Great White Male.
It failed to show the irony of a headstrong young feminist (daughter of a "mesmeric healer" and a chronic hypochondriac) allowing herself to be manipulated on all sides while falling for a dull, misogynistic Southern lawyer.
And while Warbeck does his usual tough-guy shtick, the real amusement of "Panic" is the pair of tight-binding white jeans he wears during the last act...never has a bulge been so shamelessly exploited since David Bowie donned tights in "Labyrinth"...but aside from that dubious curiosity, there's really nothing here worth seeing.
The movie's absent of gore and the monster itself is wisely hidden in darkness, with only mutated(..latex)flesh made visible as light briefly flashes on it while in pursuit of new victims to eat.
starts a search for the monster on the loose, while the army forces consider it to be better to exterminate the whole city and its entire population at once.
This movie is S-L-O-W. it takes forever to make any point and while the movie has a relatively high body count, all kills are offscreen and in the dark.
When a director can't wring any suspense from the plight of a group of small children locked in a church while a priest tries to find a way to save them, it's time to go into a new line of work.
Like Ironside, for instance... did you ever see that episode where he tried to get up the stairs without his wheelchair, and he just kept thumping along and then falling back down while the goofy music played, and then his assistant came in and said "Oh, Ironside, won't you ever learn?
Also, the story of Sid is kept on the sidelines, while in the true essence of the film, that is the story which is the most honest and strongest one.
What made the original story be world wide phenomena is that it's flawlessly written, in this "ugly" remake they squeeze in a cute faced actor just to force the story to go on further, and yes of course, make some more $$$$$ while it lasts, doesn't matter if it comes down as out of character and totally unbelievable.
I was actually squirming while watchin it repeating "no no no"... And finally just had to end its misery after the first hour.
Why any film company would choose to publicise the fact that their product is courtesy of the man whose most notable recent achievement was Escape From LA is a bit of a mystery Unlike that though, while a long way short of being a good film, Ghosts is surprisingly fun.
Both Grier and Clea Duvall are wasted in their parts, while Jason Statham's cop role is so hammed up it's embarrassing.
Only one member of the cop party is not white, and our main character, Natasha Henstridge, is as white as a human can get while retaining life.
Although I do admit that I did jump out of my chair a bit in the scene where one of the Martian Police jumped out from around the corner while the other Officer was walking toward it, but that was such a cheap shot.
The girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while.
The Weather Man, while also lame, did pose a worthy threat to humanity, and the JLA's actions in dealing with him were entertaining.
1st watched 9/1/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Giulio Petroni): Culture shock seemed to occur for me while watching this movie.
After a while, they come to the AT&T pavilion and look at what ma bell has been working on.
This was one of the worst films I have seen in a while.
The best that can be said about "Dangerous Attraction" is that slender, strawberry-blonde Roth looks pretty on screen, the cop and waitress are likable and make a cute couple, and there are a lot of suspects to confuse the issue for a while.
Comparing it to even the worst heroic-fantasy has to offer doesn't do it justice, because while those films are merely poor, this film's badness is extreme.
Another thing that you might notice while watching the film is that there is not much of a plot.
A TV actress named Tracey Needham was, and while she was very attractive, she ain't no Jim Belushi.
He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father.
I feel this way and I was getting paid while I was watching it at work.
It used to be that a John Cusak movie, while a little offbeat, was, in the end, rather good.
Here, Chief Abel Marsh (James Garner) returns from a Los Angeles vacation to read in the paper about a local woman's death while he was away.
I just finished reviewing all 9 seasons of the X files (while watching the 8th and 9th seasons for the first time) and i guess that my comment is not only about the last episode but also about both last seasons.
I loathed him and couldn't stand that his character was now the star while Van Damme's character was dead.
The former tries to actually make the movie work while the latter suffers through a thoroughly embarrassing role.
I especially love the scene of the base general just casually taking a walk in the woods near the base(as if the base commander would have the time go on a simple hike while the base was under lockdown).Also the woman scientist being treated so subserviently by her fellow male colleagues(hon, I know you have three phds, but could you just go and make the coffee).And Peter Graves final speech smacks so much of Mccarthy era propaganda, its not even funny.He warns us to be ever vigilant to guard against those outsiders who would try to control us, and change our way of thinking... OH NO!
This movie had great, creative, hilarious scenes mixed with an emotional and heartfelt story while at the same time remaining true to the elements of the original.
The poster was a copy of Daredevil and Priyanka was very annoying, while the end was just awful, the warehouse fight which I looked forward to was awful..I mean Spidey's fights are pretty spectacular but c'mon!....
By the way, another thing that really bothered me was that in Krrish, Rohit in the flashbacks while he was still young looked too much like the mentally handicapped Rohit from the first film.
Secondly, while we're on the alien kick, FEEL I HAVE BEEN CHEATED.
Starting with a baffling opening - note that the poachers see strange lights while the asteroid/egg chamber is still in outer space - and ending on a depressing note (most of the interesting characters are dead and poor Trumpy will inevitably follow them), Pod People provides two hours of... well, pain.
Even after Home Alone 2's sadistic effort, there are very few laughs -- in fact, many young kids will be frightened by what they see, while only the nuttiest of adults will laugh.
One alien goes on a murderous rampage, while the other, who was taken by a local boy as an egg, grows up to be a sweet, kind thing.
In the end the good alien gets reunited with its parents while the bad alien dies, and gets immediately sucked into the earth.
Second, Roz, while appearing somewhat matronly, still looked a little too young for the role.
However, if you don't think they'll enjoy seeing a guy get hit on the head repeatedly with a brick and have 1000 volts pumped into him while using the sink (that is just SO funny) then you might want to look into something else.
The stream becomes a series of rapids and small waterfalls that first damage the canoe, then the bow breaks off while Dr. Jim and Laura, respectively, continue to paddle and scream.
When you're being attacked by the black dots while standing next to a riverbank and the firetorch doesn't work properly just jump in the water!
Right, the actors are only giving half an effort, while they don't have any sensible materials to work with.
the CGI for blowing up the dam is cutting edge, not to mention when the helicopter goes kaboom while traveling at granny walking pace.
He gets discovered by the two criminals while he's out buying something.
One guy is in a truck driving in circles while fire bombs go off on either side of the truck, no matter where he is at any given moment.
Funny that the ants attack a guy on a helicopter and yet the two dorks who are on foot somehow get ignored while they are sticking their hands into ant larvae (looks like rice-pudding) and kicking over the logs which are presumably the center of the community.
If you suspend your ideas of reality for a while it could cause the odd smile but this is its only redeeming feature.
Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS   The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves .
The other women look decent but are somewhat forgotten while they attempt to tell some very dull story.
You can clearly see Craig Charles' face in the mask while painting the F in Red Dwarf in the beginning.
The only two sex scenes that I can actually remember was a very short lesbian scene in the club that the main guy was visiting, they were doing it while he chatted with the owner.
, so when you have a movie about the Duke escorting a bunch of refugees downriver from Red China you know what to expect ie all Chinese who aren`t commies are brave and noble and could easily pass as WASPish Americans while all communist Chinese are drunk , stupid and rape anything that moves .
And this one, while not his worst film, is a dud.
The next tedious hour involves Billy trying to convince the police that his teacher is the murderer while the teacher zeroes in on Billy.
Where was I. Oh yes, the neighbor finds herself being murdered for a satanic ritual while Billy watches, he decides to climb up onto her roof to get some pictures to better remember the moment by, and realizes his history teacher is really a disciple of Lucifer.
From this point on Kevin turns into some sort of demon child on par with the kid from "Pet Sematary" as he tries burning, electrocuting, and cracking open the skulls of his victims while shouting things like, "Nice night for a neck injury!"
And "Benteen", a major involved in the Battle of the Little Big Horn, while "Bailey" is a perversion of Jimmy Stewart's name in the best-known and most endearingly heart-warming Christmas movie ever made.
It's diverting fun but it lacks entirely any of the poetry that Sam Pekinpah might have brought to it while he was still functioning adequately.
When a columnist is killed while looking into the Crusaders, Howard Malloy finds himself appointed a special prosecutor.
Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same general plot as the first one.a few of the particulars have changed,including the location.this time Kevin is Lost in New York,while his family is somewhere else.the 2 bumbling Robbers,Marv(Daniel Stern)and Harry(Joe Pesci)return and of course meet up with Kevin and slapstick ensues.this movie is a bit longer,and i felt it took a while to get going,but once it does,it's very funny.the booby traps Kevin designs are just as elaborate and cause a lot of pain and grief for Harry and Marv,and a lot of hilarity for the audience.this movie is a bit more touching and heartwarming than the first one,and at least as funny.the only downside for me is the slow beginning.otherwise,it pretty much lives up to the first one.for me,Home Alone 2 Is an 8.5/10
because it won't work for a good while when it is in the water, second of all where in the name of god did they get the guns?
I happened upon this short movie while flipping around channels and since it was so short, I decided to see just what it had to offer.
Every once in a while -- perhaps more frequently than that -- you watch a movie and marvel at the the notion that someone would spend the time and resources to transform a stunningly incompetent script into a feature film.
The fairground scene equally predictable and nauseating as we see the "romantic interest" blossom, while bad kids steal fireworks, and you just know "sumthin' bad is gonna happen" There's even a "bridge crossing" reminiscent of SBM, at which point "bad earring boy" falls into lake, is naturally saved by boy, just before they all go over the waterfall that wasn't there 2 minutes ago, and the dog has disappeared only to make the customary reappearance at the end of the film when everything turns out happily ever after, the good and bad all become friends, and while playing chess (the way new best buddies always do), along comes baddies daddy, with a peace offering, and a hearty welcome and along comes doggie to be greeted with absolutely no emotion by kid, and they all lived happily ever after.
Lassie, with Tom Guiry, is a much more enjoyable film, and while as predictable as most of these films are, is at least played out with some passion and enthusiasm.
Mainly all you heard was choppy, barely audible dialog, then crappy background music blaring in the background while scenes skipped around like the west was won.
So while the  McCallisters boarded the plane to Florida, Kevin boarded the plane to New York!!
So the next day while Kevin was enjoying a limo ride across town, Tim Curry discovers that the credit card Kevin used to check in was stolen.
Outside, Kevin reads a map while Harry and Marv depart from the store.
Oberoi, who at times has almost gleefully recalled his training at NYU continues to spit out roles that incline viewers to believe that he didn't actually learn anything while in training.
Because the producers felt that he could help to sell an appearance that consists of him throwing shadow punches at the camera while inter cutting to the rest of the cast dancing in their 'bling' gear - that and the fact that Tyson needs the money right now.
I think I'd have loved this film when I was 9 or 10 but now I can only watch it in disbelief while I shake my head and mutter "Oh, come on!"
When his wagon breaks an axel, he's forced to stay behind with a small disparate group and look for a large enough piece of wood to fix it, all the while contending with in-fighting and the lingering threat of Comanches.
I couldn't help thinking while watching, as another viewer commented on this board, that here was a half century early preview of the politics of appeasement that the liberal Democrats are waging during the present day Iraqi War.
It became unbearable after a while, I must say.
He's not particularly witty, especially for a professor, and he does really annoying things like show up uninvited to spy on her while she's out with her brother and then cover it with a lame excuse.
Maybe it had something to do with that transorbital lobotomy a while back -- that might explain the baldness.
A New York cop is brought in to try and find Clouseau by picking up his trail he was on while investigation the disappearance of the Pink Panther.
It's simply a chance for everyone to waste time while Blake Edwards continues to beat this dead horse for all it's worth.
This time around, Kevin gets left behind at the airport while the rest of the family travels to Florida.
Now, Kevin has to foil their plans while he is dealing with management from the hotel he's at.
Fonda appears bored, while still trying to appear smart and glamorous, in her role.
Basically, while watching it with three good friends of mine, I forced myself to fall asleep.
Trying to squeeze too much into X has meant that a lot of it doesn't have any point - while the characters are easily distinguishable in terms of their powers, they don't do enough to actually mean anything to the audience.
A new chapter that promised to have both the charm and aura of the old while incorporating the new technology of the day.
Granted, Jar Jar ButtMonkey would have been far less intrusive (say, only as much as a proctological exam) were he not so abrasive and his voice less like the experience of simultaneously chewing aluminum foil and scraping your nails across a blackboard while a band of dwarven accordionists march in clockwise fashion around you playing an atonal interpretational montage of Bette Midler's greatest hits.
More importantly, I think, is the way that the film portrays entire alien races as having a species-specific character, as though they were created with racial personality cookie-cutters; hence, the Hutts are gangsters, while the Gungans are clownish, petty and stupid.
All he manages to do is p*** people off while at the same time manage to avoid death every moment due to some undeserved luck.
The acting was wooden and rubbish, Yoda saying everything backwards, (which he didn't do in either Empire Strikes back or ROTJ), gets horribly boring and annoying after a while.
Keep in mind while reading my comments that I am - and always will be - an avid Star Wars fan.
Starts with a woman who cooks (adobo - a Filipino dish) and looks out the window, while she narrates the opening spiel of the movie -- all to the tune of some funny yet wanting to sound mystifying music that continues throughout the movie-it was irritating!
Having seen my share of Regal and Viva films, I'd say that while the production values were better than usual the director can't overcome the bad acting or maybe his own style of directing.
They find a patient from Amazon with a unique case of tumors in the memory cells, and while examining him, the glove of Taylor ruptures and his finger touches a strange powder.
There seems to be more pointless and stupid chases in this film than any I've seen for a while.
I'm watching this movie while I write this and still can't believe this wasn't filmed in jest.
He hires a new assistant based on her dress and shoe size so she can wear his wife's cloths while at work, decides that arrangement is too weird and asks her not to come back, sells all the cloths and resumes his boring meaningless life.
About the only time people are not lighting up or puffing away or communicating through clouds of smoke is while they're involved in chases.
I have the board game (made a while back), tons of books, the piano book as well which I play all year round and I've watched the movie about 80 times so far.
All this film did was show how great it was to be a football player in Masillon and they could easily get away with anything they wanted while being glorified as heroes and political footballs (pardon the pun).
We get a view of a man who is simply all alone, out-casted by a film community that once embraced him, and sullen by the fact that people don't care about his movies after a while, or the kinds of stories and characters he wants to portray.
My wife wandered through the room while I was viewing, and asked, "Why are you wasting time with this crap?"
Inexplicably, Bela Lugosi and Mini-Me show up (okay, it wasn't Mini-Me, but a close relative of the annoying midget variety)and act creepy while everyone else is barely acting at all.
However, the plot is just...stupid and I was not once thrilled or scared while watching this.
- however, judging by the absurd split-second flashes to the body on the morgue slab every once in a while, the film-makers apparently thought the audiences constantly needed to be reminded of this novelty!
Hear the corpse stick her two cents in periodically, while the same spooky chord plays every time.
At times you will have to fight off boredom while watching this flick, but the occasional voice-over from the main character makes you want to know how it all will end.
What is weird is that while the show has obviously turned in to a train wreck, it is still on even though you can tell no one cares anymore... Their daughter has been replaced twice, even going from a brune girl to a blonde girl between 2 episodes, but if you can't tell that it's a sign even the producers don't care anymore then keep watching by all means!
Maybe Om Puri's parts were filmed earlier and at least attempted a Bengali accent, while the others simply had no clue their characters are Bengali!!!
And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I felt Park did this at very inopportune times.
The rest of the film, which keeps a fairly light tone while throwing in bits of melodrama and a badly done attempt at action at the end, involves Williams' and Thompson's efforts to get off of the island while unraveling the mystery of who Chandler is and what he is doing there.
Still, you have to give Esther credit: even while stranded in the sticks, she manages several changes in her hairstyle and goes through a myriad of colorful outfits.
It's nice to watch a clean movie, however some brain cell lossage might occur while watching this film.
Dave Starsky, while Owen Wilson of "The Big Bounce" updates the David Soul character Det.
Altogether, while its boasts several funny scenes, this "Starsky & Hutch" remake doesn't amount to much.
Featuring stupid characters, including: a perpetually annoyed priest who doesn't allow anyone to complete a sentence while speaking to him; a dry-boxed old penguin who morphs from cheerless octogenarian virgin to yardstick-wielding commando an hour in; mean girls who are also dumb sluts; mullets; tawdry demonology; bad boys time-warped in from the '80s; and a thoroughly despicable wuss-boy hero.
Its been a while since I saw a movie that infuriated me like this one.
It took me a while to find this movie here on the IMDB.
It's something that Lemmon does so well, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.
The idea of having radio/TV stations still running while earth is being taken over clearly influenced Romero in Dawn of the Dead.
Paris Hilton (while stupid) is no dummy when it comes to money.
She laughs all the way to the bank while audiences in America continue to watch this.
I mean it's like the kid in your 7th grade class who sings songs into his dad's tape recorder, then he brings them to school and he laughs while the rest of the class just sits there feeling pity and shame for hating someone so much, knowing he's trying to bring laughter to the world, but to spend so much time on something so inconsequential feels karmonically wrong.
He's just moved to Jefferton to try and make a living while making the world a better place, in spite of the town being populated mostly by degenerate mutants bent on torturing him to death, his new wife and 3 stepsons chief among them.
Still, Tom is so adept at messing with your emotions while mocking our society that it's worth watching once.
Burrows is tall , slim and elegant while Mullan is a wee middle aged Scottish guy and the two of them make one of the most unlikely screen couples ever committed to celluloid and their lust filled relationship is very difficult to believe in .
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
But, while they are on the plane, they find out that the flight that they boarded to go back home is hijacked en route to....Havana, Cuba!!!
The effects of marijuana on the characters are at times similar to what heavy alcohol consumption might be, while at other times the characters behave more like they've been snorting cocaine, and eventually it is compared to the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Another man just sits in a chair and giggles insanely, while all the women turn into nymphomaniacs.
Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.
I loved her patience, while he was off on a rampage.
Kiefer Sutherland looks fat, out of shape & has a really bad moustache but managed to live this down & has gone on to have a fine career as a respected actor while Lou Diamond Phillips has made dozens of low budget straight to video action films.
The pacing is better and the characters, while still a bit stiff, more relatable.
The lightsaber battle with Yoda at the end, while laughable, is quite entertaining.
In Firecreek, Jimmy Stewart basically spends the entire movie "turning the other cheek" while also trying to be the volunteer "Town Sheriff."
A retarded guy who happened to be the town deputy gets lynched by the bad guys thanks to James Stewart being at home with his young wife while the outlaws were burning down the town.
Give me a greatly exaggerated expression, while delivering lines with the life-like qualities of a typewriter, and the speed of a machine gun?!
AIDS is undeniably there, as is child abuse, while internet predators are problematic.
In the early 1970's, veteran stars (Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Kate Hepburn, Olivia DeHavilland, Joan Bennett, and Bette) were all working; Hepburn and Stanwyck pretty much remained unscathed, while Bennett's "Dark Shadows" was still a hit no matter what the critics thought.
I first saw it on a tour bus while studying in Ghana, West Africa.
All in all, the primary emotion I felt while watching the supposedly gripping trials and tribulations of the heroic duo was a restless queasiness, and the urge to bolt from my chair and run shrieking into the night.
And one scene which was hilarious was the young man trying to explain how he's a counseller to stop people doing things that are bad for them, and what addiction was, all while ostentatiously smoking a cigarette.
Dreamworks needs to stop delving into the animated world for a while and give the movie going public something to look forward to that is actually worth their time.
Plus, while I didn't think it looked very realistic, there was tons of fake blood as well.
Apparently they've never traveled or have never experienced a modicom of mess while traveling (and I LOVE to travel), or, have simply never had a really bad 48 hours, doing whatever!
I liked almost all of Thea Beckman's books and if this is the way the movie-industry treats them i just hope the rest of her stories will be kept of the screen and in the hands of people who do not feel like reading a book once in a while is to much of an effort.
They act like normal people while having sex and none of them seem to have been physically enhanced, The star, Gry Bay, is a true natural beauty - not at all like the typical "silicone bombshell" that plays in the blue movies.
She morns him for a while then decides to just "have fun" with multiple partners and no commitments.
In another wonderful scene where sex becomes comedy, Anna and Johan start to make love, while Frank is asleep in the next room.
I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point?
Sure, he could do the flip kicks, throw his opponents into pottery, and every once in a while deliver the crushing elbow-drop, but it all just falls flat.
Tom Long does well with what little he has, while Jeffries and Williamson make do.
Woody makes the effort to mask his discomfort, while Godard seems determined only to sustain that discomfort by employing indirect tactics designed to catch him off-guard.
I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.
To sum it up, Parsley Days made me feel like I was lying in a patch of dirt, in a stranger's backyard, wrapped in a cold, wet, musty smelling towel, while eating a bowl of plain white tofu, and listening to Ani DiFranco.
So, he sneaks her away from Karloff's home (where she is staying while she "recouperates").
Frightened, vulnerable refugees, escaping the political tensions permeating Europe in 1930 (and, we are to assume, the escalating prominence of the Nazi party), come to stay with friends in London; seven years later, having received their British citizenship, the younger sister embarks on a dancing career while the older sister reconnects with her handsome fiancÃ©, now a newspaperman and leader in the political underground.
The film was still watchable, and while it's not one of the better films I'll be seeing this year, it has some redeeming qualities.
The strangely Byzantine plot doesn't take itself too seriously, and writer/director John-Paul Nickel takes the opportunity to send up romantic comedies and Indy films alike, while making a movie that is arguably both.
Also, wasn't it nice of the guard standing watch, to not struggle while his neck is being chomped on and to die in 5 seconds without a noise or spurting any blood............  What used to be somewhat watchable and enjoyable (yet always somewhat far fetched) has turned into a complete joke of unrealistic moves, actions and timelines, just another good series gone bad due to poor writing and what probably amounts to the almighty dollar from the advertisers over content.
And, while the lesbian vampires might have a taste for blood, there sure is very little of it in this film.
For most of the movie, you can run out to the kitchen to grab a snack without missing anything of import - it'll give you something to do while you're waiting.
Apparently, by being remarkably pushy while trying to look vulnerable worked in 1971 - perhaps I should have tried that at the singles bars.
The ending sequence is awful - the Countess is being driven through a wooded road at night, urging the other survivor from the hotel to drive faster, faster - so they'll get to their destination before daylight, while distracting them with love chat and fondling.
He realizes while trying to kiss her that she's a virgin, then respectfully backs off and gives her some money for a cab.
To make matters worse the character's are one dimensional stereotypes, the dialogue is awful & at 100 odd minutes it's far too long & feels more 100 odd hours while watching it.
The Thirst: Blood War is terrible, I haven't given a film a lowly one star rating in a while but this throughly deserves it.
We actually ended up at the premier in Pittsburgh while visiting and have managed to see it at least a couple more times.
while endlessly complaining about scheduling problems.
World civilisation is here made stupendously dull presented by someone who achieves the difficult feat of being extremely superficial and tediously rambling at the same time while being apparently unable to get off-screen long enough for viewers actually to see or appreciate the "treasures" he is so earnestly and witlessly wheezing about.
For example two movie theater clerks poke holes into paper cups and get kinky with the popcorn tubs while two main characters talk about going out to the improv later that night.
No doubt many cineastes will find "Northfork"'s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity, the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch "Charlie's Angels" or something.
I thought of that review several times while watching "Northfork".
Bob swore live on air in 1985 but he organised the life saving world changing concert so he can get away with it , but here we saw Green Day swear in a pre recorded piece from Berlin while Hyde Park heard the F word come from Velvet Revolver ( I've still no idea who they are ) while Snoop Dogg continually ranted on about a " mother figure " or something .
I see the record sales of some acts have risen by over 1,000 per cent   " Theo you're so cynical you disgust me "   Sorry that wasn't my intention but I did read in the press that all the artists at Hyde Park received goody bags with contents that cost several thousand pounds while the African children who appeared on stage with the artists got a free T-Shirt .
I won't condemn them all of course because as I said Geldof is a genuine living saint while other artists appearing are genuinely caring about the suffering in Africa especially Bono whose set with U2 was far superior to the performance seen at Wembly 1985 .
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
I had friends over while watching this movie, but afterwards I think they considered me their worst enemy after putting them through this trash.
Hadn't heard from you in a while.'
The story is basically about the spy stealing the German master plan for the war and the efforts of the Germans to get it back while the Brits try to get it to the General at HQ.
Excuse me while I pluck out my eyes.
seems caught in a cultural time warp; see, it's set in the "not-too-distant-future", but was made in 1989, while all the actors look like they're livin' like it's 1979 (even feathered hair makes a comeback!
In the future humanity is on the verge of destroying itself which leads to the scientists at ROTOR to make a cyborg policeman who goes berserk and starts killing people for speeding, now it's up to the scientist to destroy him while (in the film's most laughable moments)he waxes philosophical about the robot's place in the universe.
I noticed I had my trigger finger rested on the fast-forward button on my remote while watching this and I had to fight off the urge to use it many times.
Still, there were at least three scenes which have to be seen to be believed: a chauffeur popping pills while driving gets his car smashed by an oncoming train; the lengthy "drug party" itself with the participants freely sniffing coke and injecting heroin while dancing and bickering amongst themselves; and a completely irrelevant bit (obviously stock footage) of a couple of snakes fighting capped by the victor literally swallowing up the defeated reptile!
Carly Turnbull's performance at Albany was very flat and while acceptable in places seemed like she spent the majority of the film reading her lines of an autocue!!!!
The rough camera-work and voice-over are a little too obviously stolen from other "cool" films like "Snatch" or "The Boondock Saints", while the top-notch sound effects often miss their effect.
It's informative, all right, but after a very short while you realize that all you're watching is a bunch of clips of junk exploitation pix & mostly fatuous comments on them.
Wow, for quite a while, I was actually expecting to like this movie!
I don't recall even knowing about it upon its release in 2003, but was aware of its 2006 sequel, "Underworld: Evolution", while it was playing in theatres.
Well, it took a while, but I've finally seen this first film of the two, and while I was expecting to like it enough to watch the sequel, it certainly didn't work out that way.
I often wondered while watching this movie, if they even auditioned the child actors (most were terrible at their job).
The ending, while nice, isn't good enough to warrant a recommendation on my part.
I watched quite a while back, so can't really comment on the editing, etc - but the bitter after-taste still lingers and when I came across it here on IMDb, had to vent some latent frustration that had been pent up.
In the end, the killer becomes inhuman and manages to stand atop a car going 45 while trying to continue his bloody rampage and just won't die.
They made the killer too inhuman and pretty much made it so he could move from one place to another in a matter of seconds, while if I were to run the same distance, it would take ten minutes.
If you manage to see the deleted scenes on the DVD you'll see they're mostly dialog, Essentially any shred of a plot is there, while the film as released is just action.
After a handful of survivors have escaped, Alice is caught and put in a lab, where she not only manages to escape, but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials.
Thankfully, the lighting was very well done, so the film maintained a dark, night-time look while simultaneously allowing the viewers to perfectly see all that was happening.
This obscure Universal "B" horror flick is also included in that yet-to-be released Box Set I mentioned in my review of HOUSE OF HORRORS (1946) above and, unfortunately, while I would certainly say that this one is more readily enjoyable, my verdict overall is equally lukewarm.
3)Micheal Madsen looks like he shot for the movie while going for a walk and did it just for the goggles.
Roberts being the most pathetic and stupid looking "hero" ever running around like a complete idiot and trying to clean things up while the stupid president is being kidnapped by a wannabe psycho.
How many times have YOU been been bit on the butt by a wild rat while crapping in the desert?
(How appropriate that I first learned about it while waiting for the lousy "Indiana Jones 4" to begin.)
Don Coscarelli's vision, while implemented in a low-budget and thus low-key fashion, has proven to be a major influence on horror films of the '80s and '90s.
Some of the cameos I've seen while flipping by the station have been hilarious.
I've been watching Charmed for a while now.
They simply prattled on about how evil they were, laughed manically for a while, and then tried to kill people for no real reason besides the fact that they felt like it.
The clone has particular appeal for young women who wish to fight the forces of evil with their supernatural powers while wearing halter tops, stiletto heels, and glitter eyeshadow.
I noticed that the average age of the actors on "One Tree Hill" is around 23 or 24 years old while the actors on Degrassi is closer to high school age.
Brooke Shields is a spoiled little rich girl who decides she wants to enter a desert automobile race and since whatever Brookie wants, Brookie gets....  Streaking across the sand dunes in her favourite sand-colored scarf and cute little goggles with the wind blowing sand in her beautiful brown hair, Brooke gets kidnapped by a handsome sheik with a GQ beard who whisks her away to his pad and ties her up while Brooke pretends she doesn't like it.
The whole point of minimalization in film-making is to recreate the charming, intriguing scenarios that occupy everyday life while avoiding the uninteresting staleness surrounding those moments (watch an Ozu film if you can't get your head around this concept).
The editing in this film is in fact so bad that a friend had to explain to me what was happening while we watched it.
We get lots of screaming and heavy breathing from Danielle while the creature attacks her.
The focus on character is nice, but the material just wears you out after a while, and there is no real driving force to the plot.
So, while I liked reading the other reviews, I was perplexed by the great cast comments.
And while it is still easy enough to get the gist of the plot, the background in those minutes would have been nice.
I sat stunned for the next 10 minutes, mouth agape, missing several key plot points while I sat there thinking to myself, "They really killed him?
Iron Eagle II is fun in short spurts it is just that there is just too much character development and Gossett while good is not there nearly enough to bail out the movie's lame drama.
What I could see almost instantly that the sinister and well hidden agenda of this anime is undermine the male gender while lionising and glorifying the female.
But after a while I began to enjoy my children's involvement in the movie and reaction to this which was no less than enjoyable.
It says something about the acid generation that while PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was a dismal box office failure in 1959, twenty years later PHANTASM was popular enough to achieve international release, spawn at least four sequels, and launch the career of questionable auteur Don Coscarelli.
Some kids and adults gathered around the truck while the announcers stated that "The Stuff" was here.
There is nothing more to say, while many of the old actors are still there, several of them died under recording, unfortunately this wasn't enough to stop this atrocity from being made.
And this while watching it in the dead of night alone with the lights off.
There's also a laughable scene showing intercut shots of Sly Stallone doing some ballet aerobics (or something) in his house while Sharon Stone just stands in the middle of her own living room doing a Marylin Monroe in front of her open breezy windows.
Also, I missed the first hour, so part of my brain was able to work at reconstructing the plot while I watched the eye-candy.
The action sequences such as the Sly kicking ass and taking names while encountering a couple of thugs on a bus and throwing one out the window, a hotel room explodes and collapses into the ocean with the bad guys still in it, and the funky way Sly sets traps for the bad guys gives this movie redemption.
Woods makes the most (which isn't much) out of a standard psychotic-bad-guy role, while Stallone is not only unconvincing but quite laughable, as well.
The acting is terrible from all involved, Stallone is even more wooden than usual, Stone is just plain awful & not particularly good looking in this while the usually superb James Woods is left trying to make the best of a terrible script & a rubbish character but even he ends up looking somewhat embarrassed.
April appears to present gifts to the teen terrapins as they've offered to watch her apartment while she goes on vacation.
Walker argues that Norinaga must buy his guns to quell the rebellion, while Norinaga fears that all is lost now that the scepter has vanished.
Writer/director Stuart Gillard is so desperate for something to fill his decrepit movie's 90 minutes that he sends the annoying, jerky-mouthed puppets back to a laughably unconvincing 17th century Japan and rips off 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' while he's at it.
The smiling dead kid and the Japanese woman with an American accent are just two of the inattentive touches in this blandly photographed, unfunny threequel, while Wilson's demise must rank amongst the worst visual effects ever committed to film.
It takes their news reporter friend April (Paige Turco) with them while back in New York the humans from Japan who have another time device are in a bit of surprise when they realize they're not at home.
With the turtles in Japan, they befriend many of the townspeople with tough turtle Raphael being a pal to young Yoshi while Michaelangelo finds love.
There are loads of fun scenes left out that, while not essential to the film's plot, could have kept things more balanced.
Casey has been given the task of staying behind and keeping an eye on Kenshin while the turtles go back in time.
Making a highly comedic satire that seamlessly blends comedy and drama while maintaining an interesting plot and effectively conveying the message can be done.
In fact, there are so many that it becomes distracting while viewing the film.
They always show up in hordes yet while looking over the city, you never see them wandering in the streets.
- Cara Wiliams had the best part of all - play a mother that throws her kid away while throwing herself at some con that walks into your house.
2) When the female lead does her little dance in front our hero while he works out.
Loving was underrated, and descended into slapstick homage, while Convenience was also an amusing exploration of the coarseness of the series.
Lance Peters's script seems to be a formula of what people think a Carry On is about, rather than a film in its own right, while the overlong scenes and flat direction justify why this one killed the series off.
Co-star Joan Sims is in full battleaxe mode, sharing much of her screen time with a rude Mynah bird (voiced, uncredited, by director Gerald Thomas), while middle-aged lotharios Windsor Davies and Jack Douglas make fools of themselves by pursuing a couple of bosomy dolly-birds (Carol Hawkins and "Coronation Street"s Sherrie Hewson).
If you haven't seen this movie than definitely do so, or if you have not seen it in a while, give it another go and enjoy!
It takes a while to get going (nothing much happens in the first half hour), but when it does there's scarcely a letup.
Now, please excuse me while I go rinse my eyes out with bleach to try and cleanse myself of the festering tripe I just watched.
"Loser" woman assumes role of attractive professional to get the guy who's "unavailable" either through another relationship or because he would normally be out of the woman's league, all the while ignoring the supposed "loser" who is in love with her.
After a while of watching you realize this is all there is and you can't help but feel a little cheated.
It's difficult, while watching this Giovanni flick ,not to think of Jacques Becker's "le trou" (1959) ,the script of which he wrote.But whereas the heroes of Becker's masterpiece were digging a hole to escape from jail,the "heroes" of " les egouts" are digging a tunnel to rob a bank.The characters are not endearing ,former firebrands ,although the lead rather recalls some kind of "true life" ArsÃ¨ne Lupin ,but a humorless Lupin.One does not see why one should take an interest in those men (and woman).Robin Hoods ,they definitely are not.
Stalker , Solaris ) ,while it also steals from Kubrick's Odyssey series.
These animations have been used, reused and used again during the movie and look always the same, starting annoying the audience after a while.
But the story is pretty bad and while the dark space station sets a claustrophobic mood at first, it starts to get annoying at some point.
The budget isn't large for this movie, that's obvious and still the director pulled some extremely good shots and some solid acting while being uneven at times (considering the budget, I can only guess that some takes as to be done only a few times), still, beyond that there is nothing to properly think of.
After a while, it just becomes tedious waiting for the next victim to go off alone.
Poor Donatien, even Geoffrey Rush assassinated him while he was dead.
As they fall in love they have to deal with the unusual ways that each of them have created purpose for themselves--the very reasons society has rejected them--while also facing their prejudices about age, race, and sex.
Once in a while, you watch a movie where you can just immediately tell that the directors mother is also his aunt.
It repeatedly rips off one horror movie after the other, all the while setting new lows in acting, shooting and musicianship (yup, the score was awful to boot).
Later they become friends, while Rebecca sees supernatural events with drowned people in the lake.
Further, I am not moralist but the lead character Rebecca has the behavior of a slut, having casual sex with two strangers in a couple of days and while grieving the death of her parents.
The main thing I wondered while watching HIGHWAY was what possessed Jared Leto and Jake Gyllenhaal to do this movie.
This game has been out for a while, but if you don't have it yet: DON'T BUY IT!!!
It's just another one of those stupid games where you go around killing things, while in the background you experience a horrible plot that was obviously put together over a weekend.
It's a traditional Western (partly comedic and partly melodramatic) that plays like a bunch of TV Western episodes pasted together in slack fashion, while also projecting some of that "spaghetti" dirtiness and desolation.
I never lived in the Old West, but I cannot imagine that the people living in it would have sat around and just watched while one man was going around totally berserk; the early inhabitants of the frontier were tough people (unlike modern-day pansies) who would have had this "bad man" chopped up in little pieces, cooked, and then eaten.
I guess it'll be quite a while until I come across a movie as bad as this rubbish.
That and a later routine with Ted in which the boys perform "The Elevator Dance" (in which Larry stands still while Moe hand pops his mouth and Shemp rubs sandpaper together) which has "no steps to it" are the funniest parts of the movie.
Characters sit in the bath or smoke joints while talking about living life to the full.
The orgy scene is laughable with one character spouting pretentious rubbish about exploring the darker side while wearing a dog collar.
XANADU is more of a series of incongruous elements and ideas the director and producers thought up (most likely while on drugs) and were haphazardly stitched together with no idea of what constitutes good storytelling in a musical format.
But no, we watch a silent ONJ try to dance with the other clunky muses while we hear the ELO song.
This annoying "technique" or "style" (don't know what to call it) is repeated a couple of times during the "film", including the whole "All over the world" moment: we watch Olivia grinning and silent while ELO sings.
We basically watch these lifeless people rollerskate in some really cheesy setting while Suddenly, sung by Olivia and Cliff Richards, is heard on the soundtrack.
Just watching two people rollerskate to a song is like being on a porch and watch two people rollerskate in the street while Suddenly plays on the radio.
Director Giulio Paradisi concocts a ridiculous mixture of horror and mysticism while roping in a sad cast of actors, both over AND under the hill.
I am SO tired of black people being shown as the oppressed and "cooler" race while whenever white people complain about other races they are viewed as "racists".
My daughter is now eight, and thankfully hasn't seen it for a while.
Or maybe your friend the conductor could, I don't know, maybe THROW A FREAKIN' SWITCH once in a while.
The whole sequence in which Christopher Reeve turns psycho and ultimately splits into two personas, having a big fight with himself, is the only reason the movie is worth seeing, and most people fail to acknowledge that Reeve actually did some truly good acting here, good enough so that the "bad Superman" is convincing and somewhat scary -- especially the scene where he is sitting in a bar, unkempt and unshaven, breaking holes in a mirror behind the bar while flicking peanuts at it (never mind that alcohol is not supposed to have any effect on Superman).
In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army.
Worst film I've seen in a while.
Anyway, one day, while jogging in a park, Matt is mugged and his wallet and watch are stolen.
He's just another man in a monkey suit smashing cardboard sets and doing battle with a toy-tank army while clutching the pretty blonde heroine (Joanna Karns of "Growing Pains", then going by the name Joanna De Varona, and who can blame her for changing her name after this one).
I chuckled a few times while watching this mess, just not believing what I'm seeing or hearing.
Characters in this movie speak in a stream of continual profanities, fire flaming arrows and guns at the audience (while smiling), and the gorilla throws rocks at you and flips you the bird.
I saw this film awhile back (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was TERRIBLE.
Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer.
The only way to see this is to gather all your friends just to make fun of it, preferably while drinking heavily.
What's weird is that in BRING IT ON, the stars (Kirsten Dunst, Gabrielle Union, Eliza Dushku) were playing high schoolers but looked and acted older, while here these supposed college-age girls (Andrea Judson-Yager, Bree Turner, Faune Chambers) could easily pass for high schoolers, in both appearance and maturity level!
One) they don't make an entirely new squad, two) the music is good, and three) number one and three both had good song tracks, while this had a really boring track.
The male members of the cast appear to have been selected for their looks (certainly not their acting skills) while the female members are a dreary looking bunch (although their limited acting skills are well-matched with those of the male cast).
have you ever been embarrassed for the actors while watching a movie because the movie was SO BAD?
My two friends sat through the whole movie in pure awe of the level of crappiness on screen while I sank ever deeper into my chair and contemplated suicide.
The plot, while obviously overdone, is quite capable of producing an entertaining movie: boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy and girl have a relationship, girl cheats on boy, boy breaks up w/ girl, boy wants to get back together w/ girl, and they're together in the end.
Judith detains Lincoln but they are both locked in a store room with a steel door while elsewhere Hesse crawls across a strange glowing spot on the floor badly injured & bleeding, as his blood drips onto the floor an evil demon is given the power to bring some of the various toys to life & Hesse first has his face chewed off by a mutant Jack in the Box, he then has his fingers bitten off by an incredibly vicious teddy bear & finally Hesse is shot by a toy robot using blue laser beams.
Demonic Toys is about a demon trying to resurrect itself more than killer toys, this demon just uses them every once in a while to knock off one of the cast members.
I bought this movie on VHS a while back and watched it last night.
Anyone watch Seagal jump through the paper-thin wooden wall of the train while shooting, what, 20 rounds out of a single pistol, killing 3 men(all this in 3,5 seconds!!!)???
I do recommend this movie as a rental,a discount-bin purchase, or a late night cable session while completely wasted.
In short, look at this one while you're hanging out and drinking with friends.
I saw this movie a while ago, awaiting a good and critical movie.
I have a friend that has an extensive collection of bad "B" movies in his collection and lent me this and a few others to watch while a was recovering from the flu.
The man, while searching through the city, visits known places, sits in a cafÃ¨, observes his environment.
The secondary love interest (Simon Baker) didn't make us feel she should be attracted to him, while the boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) made us wonder why she took up with him in the first place.
And while I agree that her deliberately understated performance elevated this movie to something beyond "disaster", I'd hardly give her lavish praise.
And we also get a public service announcement subplot in which it is revealed that businessmen tend to be stuffy and prejudiced, while guitar playing hippies and airport security chiefs can relate to each other.
Allegedly a comedy, I didn't laugh once while watching All the Rage.
That's exactly the feeling you'll get while watching this movie.
1 - Interrupts a conversation that sounds as normal as any in this movie  2 - Writes "Keep talking normal" on a newspaper on the table  3 - Puts his index finger to his mouth with the universal "shhh" sign (how does one "shhh" while talking normally?)
to create a sense of mystery and drama, why do directors just set it up and let it run while the actors talk?
Incomprehensible, pretentious, shoddy and cheap are the descriptive words that sprang into my head while I was watching it.
The rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator.
The second season, while having some good episodes, had some of the worst plot episodes invented.
At the time, a certain way to prove one's talking picture prowess was to sing a song; so, Bow inappropriately bursts into a song, while home with apparent maid Louise Beavers!
The idea of women working during the war in the war production plants was critical to the war effort, and the attempts at coping with an almost unbearable life situation with women workers sharing a house while their husbands are overseas was common enough to have true dramatic value; yet, this movie never seems to reach its high potential.
One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man.'
I could go on for a while...
The Actors while well meaning do not hit the mark with their characters.
Unless you want to see a version of the Plague that puts Oran in South America in 199..., changes the Rambert character to a woman who fingers herself in a cafe while checking for Buboes, changes Tarrou and Grand into giggling novelties, and replaces the enlightening separation theme from the second part of the novel and changes it so that the characters and merely horny, than this is for you.
The soldiers are thus shown as ultimately superior intellects in warfare, and while they may have been, Te Wheke was taken so easily, almost casually so, after months of successful evasion.
In one final battle cars were coming directly straight Antonio and his 2 buddies they spray bullets over bullets , not a single one hits the while his shot just inside from his guitar case is far more accurate.
Maybe this was an experimental work wherein each actor was told to write their own Mummy story/script and act out (in whatever style of their choosing, no matter how incongruous) their self-penned part while others did the same.
Lou, a dubiously celebrated archaeologist (with an ever-present flask), carried off the role with aplomb and MUCH overacting, and was probably actually drinking during the production...I dearly love Lou, but I could NOT stop laughing at his performance here...and the guy who was the sidekick on "Home Improvement" and the face of Orchard Supply there for a while, (yeah, the cute bear) was humorous enough...however, the most interesting part of his performance, HANDS DOWN, is that the very last time the audience sees him, he is having a "spasm' or "seizure" of sorts, presumably from a curse and his last words were "I gotta get some fresh air!!!"
I laughed until I cried...perhaps it was because of the glass(es) of white zinfandel I sipped while watching...(..hey, lay off..I'm a Raider fan, whaddaya want!!)
It is best watched while drunk at 3am after the clubs have shut and you just want something on in the background while you and your mates finish your pizzas or you want something to fill the awkward smoochable pauses in the conversation between yourself and the latest bit of skirt/trouser you picked up.
This movie, while referencing and showing clips to other movies, generally takes most of its inspiration from 8 1/2 and, honestly, I feel if I hadn't had watched 8 1/2 previously I wouldn't have been able to care about this documentary.
Thus, we have to sit around and twiddle out thumbs while the director comes up with scene after scene of boring filler.
Recently while looking at IMDb.com's "100 worst movies of all time" I saw it and realized I hadn't ranked it yet.
The gist of the plot is that Forster's character wants to push the boundaries of realism in films, and while making a new film manipulates his cast and crew to perform unknowingly to his master plan.
I got to see this film while flying to San Francisco, so in some small way I paid for it.
Orlando Jones is the music director of a college band department that has recruited band's "next big thing," a drummer out of Harlem (Cannon) who faces the usual growing pains while feebly attempting to prove that the band members belong on the same level as the jocks...  Before you start chastising me for knocking the band and all the times we had in high school, I am only saying that band members are not on the same level as jocks, but they ARE athletes at the college level.
And Vick's repetitive killing of Adam actually gets funny after a while.
I've been a big fan of Parker Posey ever since DAZED AND CONFUSED, and while I haven't been able to see all her films, I consistently enjoy her work.
Also, while Genevieve Bujold is good as always as the mother, the rest of the cast stunk.
Later while Dickey and his father are watching cartoons in a storefront window, Dickey runs off inside to the toy store and screams for the "CJ" toy.
It looks like he`s jumping in the air four or five times while doing so .
I`m sorry Hawk but looking all homo erotic while riding a horse through a forest against a disco soundtrack just doesn`t do it for me .
Well, not exactly action, more riding around the same stretch of woodlands while ineffectually ripping off The Magnificent Seven and A Fistful of Dollars (you half expect John Terry to say "My pony don't like Begin' laughed at.")
Naturally for a naff movie this boasts a good UK DVD, with a superb transfer (but then it's not as if the negative got much use) and an array of more on-set interviews than any sane individual could ever want to watch, including one great moment where Marcel is asked if it's true he turned down a $10m budget because he didn't want to cast big names: "That's a load of rubbish" he replies while trying not to burst out laughing
Let me first say, I did not select this film to watch, but it was scheduled on TCM at our movie watching time and my wife and I agreed, what the heck, lets watch John Garfield whom we had not seen in quite a while.
The only worth while line is from the Protagonist when he finally catches up to his clone..... "Get in there Xerox."
Possibly a good party movie, but definitely should not be seen while fully sober.
Definition of a donkey punch: a blow administered to the back of a female's neck while their sexual partner, positioned behind them, approaches climax.
Definition of Donkey Punch: a mediocre film trying desperately to make itself memorable by basing things around one scene that will stick in your mind for a while (and I am sure that you can guess what that one scene involves).
Then while the guys are trying the sink the body they leave the girls free to get away.
Three girl friends meet four guy friends while on holiday in Spain and opt for a sunset cruise on a yacht.
And I just love the gay guy wearing a red bikini, lisping about all of the beautiful boys while shaking his hips and petting other dudes for an entire agonizing scene!
In fact, the gorgeous women and men in 'Surf School' were probably the only things that kept me from killing myself while watching it.
In 1945, while in a temporary assignment in London, the "The New York Standard" journalist Sara Scott (Lana Turner) has a torrid love affair with the reporter of BBC Mark Trevor (Sean Connery) and she falls in love for him.
Basically the cast of over-acting 'look how funny and loud I am' unknown Toronto comedians scream and yell over each other for half an hour while they pretend to help improve someone's life with their fantastic advice and most of all their so-unfunny-it-hurts comedy.
The acting is mediocre and the effects, while impressive, feel out of place.
A boxer fights his way to the top while dealing with corruption.
I think that while there were alot of things that took away from my enjoyment of Rules of Engagement, there were a couple of plusses.
I guess while I was watching this movie I didn't know how to view it.
While this film has some good moments and strong performances from Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones (and a disappointing one from Ben Kingsley), I couldn't help but remember the "Chewbacca Defence" from South Park while watching the courtroom scenes: "This makes no sense!".
Indeed, the HUAC must have used the credits as a wishlist Â Polonsky, Garfield, Ann Revere, Lloyd Gough, Canada Lee, Art Smith, Shimen Ruskin, producer Bob Roberts and even, albeit to a lesser extent, cinematographer James Wong Howe (who had originally wanted to be a prizefighter and famously shot the bouts on rollerskates to get a more fluid sense of motion) all found themselves either blacklisted or greylisted, while director Robert Rossen only avoided that fate by naming names.
I think this movie just tried to be too many things that just didn't fit together - trying to make HotDog into a chickflick while still being cool is just plain impossible.
Special mention should go to Paul Koslo was very prolific in 1970s B movies and who appeared in some utterly pathetic movies in the 80s and 90s , while the always excellent Johnathan Pryce shows us what he can do in an early role .
I don't want to mention this but Erwin Rommel was a member of the Nazi party and he was the most respected German general by the allies because of his code of chilvary while many Wermacht non party members committed war crimes every bit as brutal as their SS counterparts so don't be fooled that everything is as black and white as seen here , as the caption at the end shows Schroeder himself was questioned about crimes against humanity after the war   There's a couple of other flaws with the script .
This is nothing more than a recycled concept and while the execution delivers the effect desired, the writing just isn't competent or the least bit artistic.
Some of them look just one step up from animatics or late 80s arcade games, while the opening stampede plays like a Road-Runner cartoon crossed with an early Neolithic cave painting.
At this point, despite having guns, the teens roll around on the floor again with the crooks for a while.
Hay-brained Mr. Hawk decides to go riding with girlfriend Nan Green (as Dotty) while the others join Paul Pepper (as Skip) and Brianne Murphy (as Pam) for water sports.
they rush to the girl's cage and the boy who picked the lock keeps watch while the boy who didn't futilely rattles the lock on the girl's cage door.
One of the spies shoots him and while Ivan is disposing of the body the boys make their move.
At one point while watching the gorilla being zombiefied the spies watch it happening behind them over their shoulders and when Ivan comes to take it out of the room there is is this amazing nothing ten second shot of three people standing in a line looking over their shoulders at a blank wall.
And while most people would agree it seems to have a happy ending, it is possible the ending could be somewhat different after the final dialogue between Garfield and Lloyd Gough where Garfield says, "What are you gonna do, kill me, everybody dies."
Wells, and while I haven't read it, I think it's safe to say that The Food of the Gods is a lot better on paper than it is on screen!
The whole movie is pretty much rats being shot with paint ball pellets while roaring like a tiger and climbing on a dolls house.
But I don't think Clyde Beatty and Siegfried Sassoon together could train 100 rats to pretend to drown, then play dead while floating underwater, a trick employed here with great verisimilitude.
Iâd watched three films by the same director prior to this one: while no discernible point seemed to emerge from them other than to show the dehumanized state of modern society, I certainly wasnât enthralled by the unrelenting gloominess of Wakamatsuâs approach.
Even if I caught the film mid-way through the credits myself, the whole thing runs for just 57 minutes: while the inherent tension within the central situation could well have sustained such modest duration, this is negated by the static direction â which renders the single-setting claustrophobic and the proceedings merely boring!
fall prey to his violent outbursts: one is tied and tortured, while another gives herself to the killer in the hope of escaping her fate!!
The under-rated Lilli Palmer is fine as the 'nice' girl who loves him as is Hazel Brooks as the 'bad' girl who seduces him while the villains are ably taken care of by Lloyd Gough and William Conrad.
The climatic fight scene is very well staged and Robert Parrish and Frances Lyon's editing won the Oscar while James Wong Howe's cinematography adds considerably to the realism.
And while Sharon Stone, for once, did a fine job as the spoiled Muse, Andie McDowell did not back up the female supporting role.
Montgomery's attempt at tough guy speech is ludicrous; it's as though he is trying to emulate Humphrey Bogart while at the same time avoiding a comparison.
Despite some so called action scenes on a Battleship and some gals that looked beautiful, but needed to eat a meal once in a while.
All in all, a pretty decent way to waste a sleepless night while surfing the cable box.
Wlliam Conrad and Hazel Brooks added some great film noir-- type dialog, berating each other once in a while.
1 hit-man for an enigmatic espionage organization Â is forever threatening to leave him and does exactly that at the very start of the film; unfortunately, while Sutherland is very good in his role and literally the best thing in it, the actress playing his wife (Francine Racette) is as stiff and unappealing as one of her husband's handiwork.
Why don't they just tell the TRUE stories and be accurate once in a while?
Movies that give you a great plot, great scenes, well written, and then just end leaving it all open to interpretation, while it is loved by the masses i hate it.
I would honestly recommending watching it while you are a little overtired because it provides some laughs and a lot of confusion.
We are introduced to her in a somewhat inventive and at the same time crude opening sequence where the young girl, having just been verbally/physically abused by her mother, goes outside to play and while playing jump rope - the rope mysteriously entwines around her neck as the children idly smile and watch.
The black leopard, while acting unlike any real animal, behaves like a movie monster, killing for fun not food.
A voiceover accompanies and describes celebrated writer and hunter Alex MacGregor (Donald Pleasence) while he and his attendants plod through a Thai jungle during this film's opening scene, as they search for a deadly rogue black leopard that has killed numerous local villagers.
Alex is attacked and savaged by the animal, and made permanently lame as a consequence, and his offer of a ten thousand dollar reward for the beast if captured unharmed is soon claimed by successful Siamese beaters, following which the hunter keeps the caged mankiller at his remote palatial home while preparing for a rematch.
The three females are escorted by a transplanted Texan, a tour guide in the Thai capital and a former lover of Georgia, and he becomes romantically embroiled with her sister immediately after the group's arrival at the vacated MacGregor estate, while the title character is only seen as he threatens the visitors, the big game hunter seemingly having been swallowed by the encroaching flora as he seeks his hardly elusive prey.
It is but it isn't, and while NIGHT CREATURE isn't a "bad" movie -- there is some camp value to be had here amongst all of the conversations, and one really good extended cat attack scene -- it doesn't have much to recommend it, aside from Donald Pleasence.
The creature must be stopped lest it ruin the local tourism business, and Dr. Loomis gets really intense, sits around glowering like a madman while knocking back the native booze & gabbering about the past, and finally lures the panther to go mano-a-mano with his wits, slamming the doors at the last second ... and then skarkers.
Jungal Trash exploitation film about white people going to the jungles and having all sorts of fascinating adventures while the natives carry the luggage.
The lines in the script are so bad that the actors almost pinch their noses while reciting them!
In the meantime, his voice remains calm while he keeps this very intense look on his face.
As his teen idols had passed him by, Fabian must have wondered where those other guys were and how he could get into another film with any one of them while doing Maryjane.
And it is a funny film occasionally, but it also annoys with its constant attempt of being the hippest movie ever made, and partly seems like an overlong rap-video, which is more than tiring after a while.
This was the most inept film to come along in a while, and there are plenty to choose from.
It was a pleasant surprise to see the great Jill Clayburgh return to film, after being away for a while, in a starring role.
If you want a movie you can watch and step away from every now and then while doing your chores or other errands, this is the one to do it with.
The film jerks from the outlandish to the sublime and back again making for an unpredictably bumpy ride while conjuring moments of hilarity and warmth.
I guess it takes a while into the movie to finally get the idea that is what is going on.
The premise of this familiar actioner had some potential, with Arnold Schwarzenegger getting to act like a "bad guy" at least for a while, but unfortunately the theme is "explored" in just ONE scene, where he admits that he likes his new lifestyle as the right hand of a mob boss.
Some examples: fight in the snow, dividing the film in chapters, the kill list, the cartoon (images in Lady Snowblood, anime in Kill Bill), the extreme education both the Lady and the Bride had to suffer (and while we're comparing: after seeing "Lady Snowblood", Beatrix's education looked like kindergarten), the big fight in an establishment (okay, the opponents weren't masked, but the next scene was set at a masked ball)...
But not only has Tarantino told us all to **** off, he he has done it while laughing in our faces.
And meanwhile there's Harvey acting as weird as ever while he frantically builds/turns into a robot.
Basic plot soon falls into Evil Dude and his robot wants the girl while Ferrah screams throughout the film.
Dad is a drunken newspaperman who can't hold a job, his mother is a crotchety whiner who demands breakfast in bed while trying to sneak booze away from her son, his oldest son is a Communist constantly spouting off about the evils of capitalism, the youngest son plays hooky from school to go to prizefights and his daughter is having an affair with a married man.
The cast is populated with some of Warner Brothers' best character actors of the early 1930's but the result is more outrageous than funny and after a while you just want someone to kill the family and be done with it.
Director Green does provide one great camera move as Papa Frink arrives home to be pursued by his nagging relatives while walking through the entire house twice in a continuous tracking shot that must have been difficult to stage.
(SPOILERS AHEAD) Although the movie is presented as a pseudo-documentary, it shows the main character in a later exercise mission in a role as a downed pilot involved in escape and evasion from enemy forces, while trying to signal to friendly pararescue forces.
The "comedy" evolves from the actors after a few sketches, however after a while even their performances become tedious and predictable.
Again, while Christopher supposedly fears intimacy, no fear is actually shown -- he relishes intimacy and honesty (and has a male friendship exemplifying these) and the under 25 women bore him because they offer neither.
Soon there are more zombies than humans & it becomes an everyday struggle to survive & find food while not get eaten or bitten which infects the victim with the virus & turns them into a zombie.
All the while this outbreak is going on & civilization begins to collapse it is being filmed & documented by the filmmakers...
The film is supposedly camera footage shot by different groups that chronicle their tribulations after London is overrun by walking dead.It mostly ended up being a film that featured a lot of bad actors standing or sitting around trying to emote the horror of fighting off zombies while talking into a shaky camera,ala "Blair Witch",while not being even close to as good as "Blair Witch".
No hordes of zombies here,just a few here and there milling around,usually standing in a group waiting for their cue to fall when someone shoots a gun their way.Then the camera holder walks up and shows us the zombie laying there with a splatter pattern of brains and blood fanned out from the head all over the ground looking as though the zombie was shot up through the head from under the chin while laying there.Bleeck!At least get the basic physics right!
If zombies stand there doing nothing while simultaneous scaring the crap out of everybody, then yes, it's very, very realistic.
The thing that annoyed me about this film was the shaky camera movements, it was tolerable at first but became a nuisance after a while, the storyline is very confusing, it even at times felt like there was no storyline, because the characters were never really developed enough for me to care about any of them, they actually bugged the living hell out of me, it also never really built up any suspense, at least not for me, because given the fact that I didn't care for any of the characters the film just bored me, plainly put.
But this film was SO bad, all I can say is: keep any and all sharp objects safely out of reach while watching this movie... because trust me, you will definitely want to slash your wrists before its painful 80 minutes are up.
Aside from the fact that these ghouls are among the least scary I have seen in a long while, the reactions the characters have to them are even less convincing.
The ending of THE ZOMBIE DIARIES is a feeble attempt at throwing the audience a curve ball, and while I won't give anything away, the film's conclusion is completely tacked on, and frankly, a cheap shot that seems at once out of place and mundane.
Julia Roberts plays a reporter named Catherine and she's interviewing an actor named Nicholas but while on his flight he finds a love letter and thinks Catherine slipped it into his bag.
But while that movie was nominated for several Oscars, and was remade in 1954 as "Young at Heart" (Doris Day, Frank Sinatra), this sequel is so lame it made me reconsider the original, not to its advantage.
It was worth a dollar just to see the heavy machine gunner do a Rambo yell while he slaughtered dozens of mindless villains.
Franco Columbu's role of the lead action character is beyond ridiculous, whilst mastering the double pistol squat run while flailing his hands, his head facing the ground as not to actually see his intended targets, there is a degree of skill required to such buffoonery.
The fact that he seems to be completely unhittable by any rounds while in this mode is even more curiously amusing.
History Boys presents its story with a superficial, pop-fashion twist to make it feel fun and hip, while the movie yacks relentless, philosophical babble over the heads of any real human's comprehension.
This pseudo- intellectual smoke screen is provided to keep the simple minds busy while the story veers into the dark territory that houses the story's genuine issue.
A teacher repeatedly fondles his students' genitals on a motorcycle, while another teacher is crassly offered to be "sucked-off" by their student, and accepts.
A funny thing happened to me while watching "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images.
Yesterday was a rainy day in California so I decided to watch this movie while my memory of the 1995 production is still fresh.
Each episode is nearly identical: some bad thing kidnaps the chick, then Ken-doll caveman turns into Mightor, while his kid brother (son?
Cheap, eye-straining (from the constant blurry underwater effects seemingly achieved by wiggling the lens around while printing the film), and soul-draining.
Finally, while I've always enjoyed Tom Conway's work, The She-Creature gives him little to do and Conway makes the most of it, sleepwalking his way to a paycheck.
The She Creature, while looking cool, is about as menacing as Lobster Themidor.
No one seems to notice that, while bullets can't stop her, she can be outrun by a snail on crutches.
For a while, I had (blessedly) forgotten this movie, and then for some reason, I was reminded of it.
The camera actually dresses up the area, and while there is a union hiring hall nearby, and the area is less than a mile from police headquarters, the site of two white men standing on that corner meant that it was either just after daylight or an optical illusion.
I was disappointed in the newer version, it wasn't true to the book and while visually beautiful didn't have the depth that this version has.
So, while the idea of reconstituted feces being sold as food may be slightly amusing, it's irrelevant to the operations of the WTO, which is problematic if you're trying to poke fun at the them.
Members of the chamber of commerce (or whatever) were interviewed while still under the impression that the WTO was really closing down, and they seem to think that it is a good idea to do so.
One scene has the scarecrow planting a seed within the lusty daughter of Priest Uncle Thaddeus(Bruce Glover, appropriately hammy as a corrupt priest who reads lingerie magazines while alone in his church)as it explodes wooden branches from her skin.
He is out of work leaving Julia to figure out how to pay the bills and get her daughter an operation while he gets drunk.
People start coming apart at the seams, while others find solace and strength where they can.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
This movie should have provided action in the form of Stone Cold Steve Austin but it fails miserably because we can't figure the F out where he is hitting and who he is hitting and what damage it does because the FRIGGIN cameraman is having a seizure while filming !
Or the black guy (characer names are hardly worth remembering) who says he will never trust another woman and then realizes the female contestant just pulled his suicide pin while she runs away.
The script here is most to blame - while 'professional' enough so that it's difficult to quote bad lines, it is a completely moronic story, utterly unbelievable - without knowing anything about the 'true story' this hypes itself as being 'based upon', I can guarantee that the one true thing you can say of this film is that it is not based on a true story.
However, as with most anything made for television, I was able to have this run in the background while doing something else (cleaning house), so I didn't have to pay much attention to it.
I was standing in line at the bank once, a long while ago and this guy in line behind me starts talking about the government grants he was receiving to make a film.
Also, while we're on the subject, that danged Texas sheriff warnt from nowhars near the Lone Star boy.
Sheen's colleague and a woman he meets while investigating are both murdered but old Zaminski (Sheen) is allowed to wander around breaching security at JPL and an installation in Mexico, unscathed.
Oddly, while this professor is supposed to be super-smart, it took him a long time to figure out what was happening.
Oddly, while the mask was cheap and crappy, the transformation process at the very end of the film was excellent--who'd have figured?
After succumbing to Siobahn's seductive allure, Colum finds the beast within starting to emerge, while Stella yearns to leave without him if necessary.
I'd suggest seeing this merely to see Cialini naked, slapping Colum as he's chained to the bed while on top of him having the ride of her life.
(Makes me wonder if someone was smoking an illegal substance while writing this script!)
Cerebral sci-fi doesn't have to be this boring (see "Enemy Mine"), and while the acting is totally acceptable, everything lacks excitement, and just drifts along towards a conclusion that was only a minor surprise.
Kelly's acting was as bad as ever and shows little facial expression while the plot itself is just awful.
I recall the handicapped man visiting museums and studying chain mail while designing his special armor.
But there's something more annoying:one of the characters is unbearable,the notorious Jens:the scene in the restaurant with the prostitute makes me sick:this bourgeois student really demeans this girl thanks to the power of his dough.Seeing him humiliate this human being while taking out his banknotes is one of the most despicable scenes I've seen in years ;and that does not make the "hero"-who's watching- nicer either.Besides guess who will be sacrificed when the others will survive?Another gratuitous scene which comes at the most awkward moment involves Jens and his priest girlfriend in the church .It's really nauseating.That makes the very last scene even more disgusting.And you know ,I 'm far from being holier-than-thou.
The theme of this mess is let women do as they wish, kill whom they want, defend the killer and get away with it, while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim.
I was particularly impressed with how the Merill character turned out-- she could have SO easily been the stereotypical vampy-sexy-screwed-up character, but she was so fragile and so NOT in charge of herself while still remaining appealing-- and with Cherry Jones, of course ("Sit down, Shelly"), and Sean Hatosy is heartbreakingly dear -- could he possibly be anything other than a small-town cop searching for stronger self-esteem?
Memorable Scene:  --Linda Blair somehow drives a car relatively competently while holding her hands over her eyes and flailing her feet all over the floor while a guy is on top smashing through the windshield.
And while Vinny Van Patten has done some good performances, this wasn't one of them.
Great acting carries the film, which, while it has an interesting starting concept, pretty much depends on the interactions of the characters to carry it.
As the film goes on we`re introduced to the characters and I couldn`t help noticing that one is Southern English , a couple are Northern English , a couple are Jocks , a couple are Irish while the sarge is a scouser .
Her co-star is a very young mustachioed Laurence Olivier working very hard to make something of an unconvincingly written character -specifically, a high-strung novelist who resents churning out hack material for quick money to pay the bills while living in a small apartment with his wife (Harding) and a baby daughter.
However, six years later, she meets up with Olivier while in Switzerland and he tries very hard to win her back despite the past.
Again while it isn't boring, due mainly to Geoffrey Rush's effectively diverting Vincent Price send up, and a saucy Famke Janssen.
The fact that it was even made while other scripts (any other scripts) were passed over is a crime.
So while I wait for Bridgette Wilson to do another horror film, I'll have to say that HOHH is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.
1. when her father disapproves of him & she tries to honour her engagement to another man - 2. when she feels too guilty to be with Gable now that her father's gone, because dad died while chasing her (!)
After a while I realized I could act better than any character in the entire film!
And while the film does end on a high note with a little bloodshed and an impressive slow-mo explosive of the Battletruck, there is little else to cheer about.
My pleasure stems from watching the hero, Hunter (played by Michael Beck of 'The Warriors' deliver the monotone one-liners while still having the physical charisma to run, dive, punch, kick, and shoot.
),while the men of the film are made to be the villians of the film,the cowardly sheriff,the bikers.Hollywood liberal politics at work again.
Then there's the matter of the radiation measuring devices they wave around reading the rather trivial level of only about 2 mr/hr or less (it plainly says so in the on-screen close up) while the scientists act as if this were a deadly amount.
I feel for Cage's character while wishing the movie would just end.
Dorian Gray (Helmut Berger) has his picture painted and, through some circumstances, finds his portrait aging while he stays young and beautiful.
As the years go by his immoral behavior continues while his portrait horribly ages.
parallel to the problem, the harbor master cut himself while playing the tuba (how can you cut yourself playing a tuba?)
Kitt Kittredge is about a little girl in Cincinnati trying to become a great journalist during the Depression, while her parents and the US are struggling to get out of the tragic events that were occurring at that time.
The 'hobos' are nothing more than a stand-in for today's immigrants while the kids whose families are lucky enough to escape the ravages of the Depression, mouth platitudes in school about the hobos not working and getting "government handouts".
The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof.
Besides, I have no idea why these bomb experts would land on the roof while they know there's a bomb in the basement.
We the audience obviously see the killer, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), and takes a while for them to realise it is him, but when they do, after about one or two more victims, including Jennifer's good friend Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), Jennifer finds herself the next, and eventually last victim of the deadly traps.
Somehow, he is able to kidnap several FBI agents, stream his vids live over the interweb and possibly rank as one of THE most uninteresting and flat-out DULLEST villains I have seen in a while.
Stuff gets bloody, while Jennifer has no clue how to intercept or capture the perpetrator.
It's an interesting premise-- a killer who uses the Internet to torture and kill his victims-- but aside from that this movie is not worth anyone's while.
If that's not bad enough, instead of Jodie Foster battling her inner demons while chasing Hannibal Lechter, we get the always beaten-down Diane Lane and her cohort played by the lifeless Billy Burke (who, by the way, seems to be this generation's Jeff Fahey).
The film narrates the story of how Temujin overcomes these obstacles and wins Bortai's heart, while simultaneously waging war on her father, the Tartar chieftain Kumlek, as well as a treacherous ruler named Wang Khan.
Maybe while someone was out in the desert looking for that document they found the first trace of the real genius who wanted this movie made - Irwin R Shyster?
I must confess that I'd wanted to see this movie for a while, if only for its notoriety in cinematic history.
Wayne drawls his way through the role of Genghis Khan, while Hayward is alternately dumb/boring as Bortai, his red-headed wife.
Legend has it that in his last days, he watched this film over and over while in bed.
The documentary spends time on "all" the performers who died, implying that they either overdosed or committed suicide while giving no real statistical evidence that the rates are higher then in the general population.
I was waiting for this movie to come out for a while, Highlander had not had anything new come out for a few years and I was eager for something new.
Okay, that was to be expected, the Highlander movies were going downhill for a while.
This film is really bad, while you have several characters from the Great TV series, it is clear they knew crap when they saw it because they gave nothing in their performances.
Methos is reluctant to involve his former good friend, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), but is forced to when Duncan encounters The Guardian, the Immortal Anti-Christ, while searching for his ex-wife, Anna, who is somehow drawn to The Source.
The performances are what make the film work, and while Mcfayden and Cox have the showier roles (and are excellent in them), it is really actress Eileen Atkins who emerges as the powerhouse performer in the complex role of a woman who has deliberately lived in denial--and who must now respond to a double-whammy that undercuts the very foundation of her existence.
To make matters worse the character's are one dimensional stereotypes, the dialogue is awful & at 100 odd minutes it's far too long & feels more 100 odd hours while watching it.
The Thirst: Blood War is terrible, I haven't given a film a lowly one star rating in a while but this throughly deserves it.
Released as "Betrayed" in New Zealand, the DVD cover which is a homage to "Basic Instinct" is somewhat misleading, for while "Basic Instinct" was no masterpiece, it wasn't as terrible as this film.
it was extremely difficult to sit through, and while i love Bill Murray, i'm sure this is some of his worst work.
the whole movie bored the hell out of me, while versus was so great and crazy, loaded with anticipation for whats to come in the next second all the way through, this is just lame....sorry, i cant tell you to go see this in the cinema or even rent the DVD, i really cant.
Let this be a lead up to something more scare in its wake, no need to bring out the pillows while watching this one though.
Independently, the two set out to unravel the mystery of Apartment 1303 while trying not to become it's next victims.
The romantic comedy genre usually proves a precarious balance between attempting to recapture the genuine passion, spark, and often hilarity of a budding romance while simultaneously doing so in a fashion unique from its many predecessors - more often than not with less than limited success.
The entire plot can be summed up as essentially a pitiful attempt to bank of the success of Meet the Parents while throwing in the occasional crack at religion to no comedic effect whatsoever, as the relationship of engaged young lovers Ben (Krasinski) and Sadie (Moore) is put to the test by a series of gruelling relationship tests by a deranged priest (Williams) attempting to determine whether or not they are fit to be married in his church.
Camera is a loving exercise to the magic of movie-making as the subjects are an aged man who became that way while watching a movie in a theater (based a dream Cronenberg really had), and a bunch of kids who have a 35mm camera and sound equipment and are getting ready for a shot.
He has a "marriage course" he wants them to take, which basically involves them doing a lot of foolish and in some cases dangerous things, like driving blindfolded while the other gives directions, or caring for 2 fake babies while they are supposed to be taking care of Ben's friend's actual children.
At one point, he has a 10-year-old kid break into the couple's apartment while they're away at a session, and conceal a wire tap in their home.
It tries to be a romantic comedy, and what little chemistry exists between the couple is ruined by Robin Williams trying to be funny while doing unfunny things.
I found this short to be uninteresting while watching it, but afterwards it did stir up some thought in me about the horror and beauty of film.
In fact, why not combine the two all the way and do very sexually oriented acts while maintaining your tough cool?
Second, while the plan made sense at first, having the man taken from a secure cell where he was chained and putting him in a giant luxury tent made my head hurt.
Several fine jump-cuts during editing as the result of things they couldn't accomplish in one take while shooting the scene.
And while she distracts him by rubbing her four breasts in his face, suddenly there comes a tentacle shooting out of her vagina - no, don't laugh, I'm serious - injecting some sort of venom in David Carradine that drugs him, so it'll be easier for the bad guys to beat him up.
Usually, the naked ladies are presented as sex-slaves or for the mere purpose of providing full frontal nude shots and being drowned in a basin of water, for Zeg's entertainment (while the rest of the village is in desperate need for water, mind you).
I suppose you can guess where the story is going from here - he tries to free the sorceress while staying alive and then there's a whole army of traders to contend with, most of which are quite angry as they were massacred before.
(But he could, of course) Oh, the couple of heroes start to french-kiss and talk about their honeymoon, while the extras chant their patriotic mantra.
She is murdered while on her holiday, and the sculptor spends the rest of the film running around Venice trying to find clues to his daughter's murder...
Jeez, Argento did this kind of thing so much better while Lado makes it look a unconvincing clichÃ©, here.
I know of one case where an extra was used to simulate a speaking role, by dubbing a voice in while his back was turned.
So, while I rate the movie a miserable 2/10, I'll give it a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
Plus, after a while the quantum-fractured wasteland this film takes place in starts to grow on you... a giant hand shaped rock made sense after the tree village (elevation: 3 feet) of cretins, the goon squad dressed as vaguely menacing knights, and the endless rolling hillocks and groves that made it undoubtedly clear that this movie takes place in...Europe... somewhere... or other.
I would have so loved to hear what Precious was saying, in her own way, but she mumbled, talked street while also mumbling, and a lot of it was just drowned out.
Well I got pressured into it by a group of women who all thought it was so "real and raw and emotional" and were sharing tissues to wipe their tears while I sat there thinking "really?
My aunt enjoyed this movie while my father and I were the only ones who realized how offensive this was.
I think some have called this a cult classic,Id call it bottom feeder material.Every once in a while we all watch really bad movies and this is below bad.
Mamie Van Doren stars in this little teen-exploitation flick about two sisters (of which Ms. Van Doren is one) who are caught trespassing while swimming in a pond.
It's an exploitation film which revels in the youth and sexuality of its cast while hypocritically preaching against the "bad guys" who would exploit them.
It involves flapping his knees open and closed in a no-hands "Charleston" while staying on his tip toes, while his torso stays perfectly erect.
I know it's me but while I can't stop laughing at Two and a Half Men or Big Bang Theory these shows just left me not wanting to watch again.
It's the story of an argentinian woman who lived the tortures of the dictatorship, she has spent the last years in spain but returns to her country to see her dad, who is about to die...the trauma of the tortures has left her unable to mantain sexual contact with anyone, and she satisfies her needs by watching others having sex or, as in the movie, hiring a young model to read her dirty novels while she masturbates...All this, believe me, it's ok...The story is not that bad until it transforms into a semi tragedy of edipian proportions, like out of a venezuelan soap opera...the directing touches of Paez don't help at all...we have horrible music (like from a hitchcock film, completely out of place), a ridicoulus atmosphere of mistrust and thriller that has nothing to do with the theme of this movie...and a bunch of supporting characters that in their attemps to portray a heartbreaking inner pain will make you laugh...
The fact that (with a few exceptions that ran 2 episodes), each story was limited to less than 30 minutes (the commercial breaks which accounted for the "less than" were surrounded by fade-outs of some new terror arising - which, even the youngest viewer realized after a few breaks, would be a false alarm when it resumed) rushed the plots of stories I laughed and fascinated over in book form, giving no time to absorb the scares, other than the phony ones resolved in 60 seconds while the camera dimmed and returned.
No, the plot wasn't rushed; even worse - it was as though the while plot was shown but it was a rushed story to begin with!
I'm really struggling to comprehend why this film even exists, while at the same time trying to understand why I have given it 3/10.
There are far worse movies out there that pretend to be funny while trying to pose as comedies.
Mary Vivian Pearce plays a woman who is accosted by a foot fetishist in a park and undergoes a bizarre sexual encounter while envisioning herself in a possible flashback of a Cinderella-like scenario.
The battle consisted of the Red army holding on to a tiny corner of the city while the German forces were ground down.
This film was a solid attempt to reach people with the Gospel of Jesus while still portraying him as the Messiah rather than just a spiritual leader.
Not only that, but the background music in this film is totally UNRELATED to the action....it's as if someone off-screen turned on a radio and let it play while the movie was being shot.
Not so much a picturisation of Ellery Queen's 1934 The Chinese Orange Mystery, this flick is a take on Paramount's 1933 Alice in Wonderland, with Miss Henry snugly and smugly repeating her part as the innocent abroad, while Eddie Quillan makes impotent if cheeky woo as the bungling knight.
"Django The Bastard" tried to create a seemingly supernatural atmosphere while at the same time keeping as close to reality as possible.
The men inside suspiciously examine Django, while finally discovering that the cross bears the name of them.
The part that really annoyed me about this movie was the fact that when they would talk about girls doing slutty things in high school, or dress code violations, the girls would stand up and show themselves off while the guys whistle.
It's a little shocking to see such a widely different level presented, as it's a little gruesome for the children to see graphic death and dying, while the adults will like the more serious scenes but become bored through the childishness of everything.
Godzilla is obviously meant for the kiddies, but everything else is for the adults, which is too mature for the younger ones, while the older fans will have a hard time accepting the kiddie stuff, making this a tough one to really recommend to.
Symbolism is tossed around a bit, but it seems as if this director was drunk while doing some of these scenes.
The dumbest thing in this film (which is not the plot or how slow the creatures walk) is when a little boy yells for Godzilla while he is walking away.
There were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that it was hilarious every once and a while, but it gets to the point where you just don't think you can finish it.
That's only because he limits himself to raising an eyebrow or suppressing a grin while Peck, Valli, and the rest of the cast alternate between performing their one-dimensional roles in leaden fashion, or else overemoting whenever producer David O. Selznick's script takes one of its hairpin turns.
Revelations fly one after another, while tears and sweat pour down grimacing faces.
After a while you wish everyone would just shut up.
Gregory Peck, who gets to wear the proverbial white wig in the final reels, is commanding while grilling the witnesses, but we never learn what makes this man tick, or why he should lose interest in wife Ann Todd (who has some spunk in her early scenes, but loses it fairly quickly for the sake of melodramatic pathos).
This is not Ice Age or Shrek, but parents will not be very fed up (just a little), while kids will have a good time.
The plot is relevant and highly believable, while maintaining it's fantasy charms.
It's a very earnest little number that tries to be "about" something; and while the actors are unskilled and badly directed, they don't ham it up or chew the scenery, and they come across as sympathetic and likable.
She plays a mom who is still in High School and has her divorced mom takes care of her son while she's in school.
A cult of guys in ski masks, led by Satoris--decked in a trench coat, suit, and tie while riding around in rusty GMC trucks--want the map and run after the kid.
Writing this review made me reach a decision: Excuse me while I go drown myself in a bucket!
The script serves as an age-biased loaf of stale bitterness regarding ageism, to which any dodgy Benny Hill-script seems vital and fresh; the characters are archetypical in the worst sense of the word, the story never brings anything interesting or lucid to the screen, and there are more chances of you being hit by lightning while reading this than there are comedic lines found in this vapid, turgid and fake implausibility; collect a billion monkeys, tie them to typewriters and I shall pay you 1000 US Dollars if even one of them should come up with anything less comprehensible.
about the murder, while the D.A.
He had a hangover from drinking too much champagne in a nightclub the previous night, while he was possessing Edwin's body.
Another man's hand is gnawed at by rats and he just leaves it there while the hungry little beasts go to work on it, just so that we can get a good look at it.
He masturbates while surrounded by rats?
But I DID see the aforementioned film so this one while still horrid, doesn't seem bad in comparison.
Some fruitcake is loitering around the streets of L.A. taking pictures of (ugly) wannabe models, all the while we hear a voice over narration as he muses about his ex girlfriend or ex wife- it's never made clear- and then strangles said wannabe models.
When she showed up this movie to producers they thought he gave them some random footage of his vacation he shot while driving from the car.
SPOILER:  Briefly their growing fondness (I really can't consider it love) turns into mutual contempt and hatred, ending with Agostino strangling Brandt to death while Brandt plunges her knife repeatedly into Agostino's belly stabbing him to death.
For instance, Brandt's knife could have been used by Agostino on her while she strangled him in a curious, if fitting reversal, of murder methods.
This is one of the strangest I have watched in a good while.
For instance, while finding the infamous hosts of the show "hack the planet" (which manages to crack into the TV station every week at a predictable time and stay on air for half an hour with a live feed) They are held at gun-point by a robotic arm!
We can laugh while we hate her.
While in search of employment and tending to his four-year-old son Ben during the day while his wife Kim is at work, Charlie has an idea.
The cast seems to have felt as uneasy with it during production as I did while watching.
and the opening shot, showing the Captain's face from a low angle while circling around him has something to it but all the rest is pure rubbish (should I exclude Worf's remarks on Klingon sexuality?).
Arriving at the tail-end of the 1970's disaster cycle, this half-baked thriller toplines catastrophe stalwart Charlton Heston (going through the motions) as an iron-jawed captain who preserves morale amongst his surviving crewmembers while awaiting rescue by military top brass (including Stacy Keach and David Carradine).
Without the standard can't fail wartime dramatics of the genre Â depth charges, torpedoes, silent running et al Â it's a pretty static affair with Heston and his crew spending most of the film sitting around waiting to be rescued while Stacy Keach hovers around the rescue ship's control room and David Carradine and Ned Beatty sit around watching from their prototype mini-sub in murky model shots.
David Greene's flat direction doesn't disguise the fact that there's little in the way of tension while at times you can't help wondering if the price of the Navy's co-operation was eliminating any possible drama from the script in the fear it might make them look bad.
I kept thinking of that terrific scene in "After the Fox" when Peter Sellers is on trial for smuggling while using the pretext of making a film to disguise the crime.
you would have a more fulfilling experience if you boiled garbage in cat urine and ate that while having weasels gnaw on your feet, and that would leave you feeling much better about yourself than if you watched this movie.
The first half of the film dragged mercilessly, while at the same time facets of the plot were not fully developed, making the story line weak and non-sensical and the characters shallow.
First of all, the age difference in the cast, while not readily apparent in the show, burns like a lighthouse beacon FORTY YEARS later.
I heard the audience laughing, of all things, at Dick dancing around in a baggy red sweater while a 3D animated caricature of him cavorted on a monitor screen.
BZ makes us cling to hope by our finger nails while steadily adding to our feet the weight of reality.
The social commentary is crude and obvious, the poor people do over the pigs while the rich people do over the poor people and take their money to boot and just to emphasise the point there are lots of shots contrasting the corrugated iron hovels of shanty town with posh apartment buildings soaring towards the sky.
Our Patty the award winning actress, who got her acting skills from the Wide Eyed Screamers Acting School, keeps her eyes wide like saucers and lays there under a table screaming bloody murder while bits and pieces land next to her.
Tom Selleck is bland and completely uninteresting, and his character speaks entirely in "clever quips", ALL the time, which really grinds after a while.
I was also wanting to get together with a friend I hadn't seen in a while.
He films a woman surfing topless while he waits to board the entrepreneur's yacht along with his girlfriend.
An Eric Clapton score is used insensitively, underscoring dialogue with unnecessary frequency; the acting (especially from Colm Meaney) renders the characters close to parody; the camera work is needlessly jumpy; while the plot is reduced to a series of set-piece encounters.
I love it when these European amateurs poke fun at Hollywood while they themselves aren't capable of making one good movie per decade.
Scenes like the old man being stabbed on the wooden barge, while everyone on shore watches on and yet no one notices what just happened.
And this business of him being such a major stud, (First he beds down a stewardess he meets, then later while he's working on the airline account, he manages to nail the owner's daughter, played by Sela Ward.)
while i've read the two books in the series and had been looking forward to this film, i forgot i'd seen it later that same day, perhaps i'd blocked it out.
Only Rachel Weisz voice acting for the dragon Saphira manages to give the movie its only good performance while Jeremy Irons sincere performance is let down by the hammyness of its lackluster script.
the guy actually sings an entire commentary about walking across a room, looking in drawers for jilted lovers, looking behind refrigerators, (nope, no one back there), all the while waving a gun around.
And he seems to be the kind of guy that believes the best way to make you leave a city would be to make everyone else disappear so you feel unwelcome, then block all the rivers and burn all the food so you'll have to leave after a while instead of say throwing you out directly... and while that might have some sort of style it's illogical and this movie is riddled with similar stuff.
Three men who kill another man while watching, I guess, was his partner plunge to his death, try and secure safety in a farm house occupied by a paralyzed grandfather and his granddaughter.
The gangsters soon notice the attractiveness of the young girl (very strangely and making the film even more "suspicious" considered what will happen later in the film, the cover of the old British tape which was banned, says the age of the girl being thirteen while there's not a mention of her age in the film itself!)
Excuse me while I go watch Dorm again.
So yuk it up while you can.
Poor Johnny Gimble, Texas's best fiddler, who looked pained but characteristically pleasant while trying to save bad, fake "country & western" music--he doesn't even get a credit on this site, while Vassar Clements does.
Cartoonish pastiche on that theme, while being hackneyed and unfair, could have been achieved with little effort, but wasn't.
And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop.
The X-Files style government/military conspiracy side of things is as dull as it sounds while the horror elements are severely lacking.
Mr. Carson and Ms. Russell seem to be having a great time while making the movie.
As for Jordache, he just sticks his nose everywhere, while bodies pile up.
Characters regularly have spontaneous discussions while standing on the floor on top of thousands of man-eating bugs.
Louise's first failed marriage, her daughter who suffered infantile paralysis and her introduction to her future second husband (Jack Carson) - in a fish pond while dressed up for a costume party linger in the memory.
", and trying to figure out one scene while it moves on to the next.
The idea of the falling sky on the chicken and the chicken running helter-skelter informing everyone about what had occurred while the people do not pay any heed to his pleas is based on a children's fairy tale.
He decides to sign for baseball where he is always told to take the bench while his nemesis Foxy Loxy becomes a star.
This plot line, though can be used once in a while if it's done once in a while, gets tiring after a while.
In this pivotal point in the history of The Walt Disney Company, where its relationship with Pixar is still on the rocks while a new president is stepping up, I wanted this movie to be a smashing success.
Arriving at a safe house that borders 'cannibal country', the threesome are able to relax for a while, until one of the gang, Mario, decides to rape the wife of their host (after spying on her having a wash in a giant wooden bucket).
The entire grueling first hour consists mostly of people sitting around complaining, while the last half hour consists mostly of people walking around in the "jungle."
My mother and her sister were going to go watch When A Man Loves A Woman while my father, my sister, and I were going to watch The Flintstones.
It is truly awful  The script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They`re the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer`s journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens .
OK, if it's 70 below why are these guys hanging around OUTSIDE the plane, shivering while wrapped in one thin blanket, with a fire consisting of two tiny sticks that wouldn't warm an insect.
At times, it's painfully obvious they are "acting cold" while a wind machine blows "snow" at the camera.
For no apparent reason, badly acting kid teams up with Yoda or something, and learns one move badly from each of 87 different martial arts, while aging 25 years in about 6 years of movie time, becoming a badly acting short guy with a hypnotically Big Head.
All the characters are boring,and while it does have some action, none of it is that exciting, plus Steve James looked very bored in this, and i don't blame him!.
David Bradley is awful here, he annoyed me, and had no charisma what so ever, and while he has lots of skill he just isn't that exciting,and he had no chemistry with Steve James!.
However, Mr. Valdemar is actually a really enchanting little werewolf who lives with his crazy sister hidden inside the house and while he intends to be a normal person with good manners, his ferocious nature forces him to be wild and dangerous to be friends with.
One woman was actually quite interested while the others feigned repulsion.
Chun Li is supposed to have amazing thighs, two bobs, sort of pale, and she is supposed to yell yep-yep while she is fighting.
He fairs more poorly against Chun Li, while in a very nice suit, but keeps the upper hand until Chun Li performs her epic Kikoken technique, which hurts him way more than it should.
So this movie has been on my radar for quite a while.
And while Meet Joe Black isn't the finest caliber of film out there, it kicks this one's butt!
Shore starts the movie out by giving a brief synopsis of his life and career, while not being shy to admit that his mother, Mitzi Shore, owned the Comedy Store, where many legendary comedians from Andy Kaufmann to Jim Carrey to Sam Kinison got their big breaks.
dumb guy shtick may have gotten old after a while.
One such part is when Shore, while in jail, is put into the hole and has a clairvoyant conversation with Adam Sandler (who provided his own voice in this movie).
It was much like driving through the rain during rush hour while you have a cold.
while looking down at his fans who are portrayed as obsessive rednecks.
After hallucinating pretty severely for a while, Lila kills the young dude with a screwdriver and chops him to bits with a meat cleaver.
This scenario is repeated three or four times while a pair of (surprisingly UNdorky) L.A. cops tries to track the maniac down.
The brothel is an idealized fantasy place where she can remain loyal to her true love all the while crying her eyes out because life's so unfair.
The songs, though melodiously rendered, are far too many in number and get on one's nerves after a while.
"This is what happens when innocent young children are left unsupervised so the adults can go off and drink and have sex," we can almost hear Jeffs saying while she wags her finger at her audience.
We get Como and Stewart singing and sort of dancing to "A-hubba, Hubba, Hubba," Blaine, Como and Stewart separately and in various combinations singing "Somebody's Walking in My Dreams," Como fronting the girls with "Red, Hot and Beautiful" and crooning "Here Comes Heaven Again," plus Carmen Miranda rolling her hips and eyes while trilling her r's through "Chico Chico," the big production number.
As far as Carmen Miranda, she's Carmen Miranda; you either like her or after a while she gets on your nerves.
Seems that some folks watched this movie in the expectation of riveting sex scenes, and while I thought that the whole ending sequence was very contrived, the sex scene did work to make sense of the movie, which was just as well since the rest of it was kind of ludicrous.
The children like him while the widowed mother (played by Beart) is a little more reticent.
It's a gauzy, soft-focus, soft-headed confection about a playboy who becomes smitten with an attractive woman while on his way to marry somebody else; she's also otherwise engaged, and their on-again/off-again relationship has the same old-fashioned complications as the other versions of this highly-concocted plot.
From an uninteresting story (two sisters going on vacation by the sea are fighting over their father & mother relationship while a maniac kills young girls with a huge dildo (!!!!)
You'll howl over the hilarious opening scene where one sis strips off all her clothes (including her sexy lingerie) in front of the other, while said other, with a fixed, disapproving scowl on her face, unpacks teddy bears, pictures of Daddy in wrought iron frames, and... a huge wooden dildo?
Though billed as a hybrid giallo/erotic thriller, there are few thrills to be had in this plodding mess of a whodunnit, and with only a few unimpressive scenes that feature any sort of horror element, the spaghetti splatter here is closer to Stauffer's lasagna (although such a comparison is actually insulting to Stauffer's, since their lasagna is loaded with taste, while this film has none).
Even the murderer's choice of a giant phallus as a weapon isn't too novel, since while reading up on Ursula I learned that there was another Italian film made before this with a killer that employed the same noteworthy instrument of death.
At one point of the movie a warrior explains that he had fought under Attila The Hun's command, while his buddy has served for Ghenghis Khan.
I'm a big fan of the Italian thriller known as the Giallo and while I went into this film knowing that it is not a Giallo; I was still hoping that director Luigi Comencini would be able to make the film interesting enough to at least be entertaining.
The film contains practically no suspense whatsoever and while some of the exchanges between the lead characters are fairly interesting and there's a few red herrings thrown in; it really is very difficult to keep focused on The Sunday Woman.
It's clear that the director wanted the film to be of high quality, and while the tatty VHS I saw it on does the film no favours, I have to say he didn't succeed there either.
Nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee: slow moving.
If the audience is expected to buy this, then the main character's a nut job whose weird logic tells him to build his wife a garden while he plods along, ever ready to escape abroad.
Personally, while very entertaining, due to its somewhat minimal story, I didn't find it as much as a classic.
He plays a man who travels out to Japan to obtain silk worms, while his beautiful wife is left at home.
Keira Knghtly, while attractive and talented enough, was particularly ill - suited for this film.
A Jerry Lewis vehicle that delivers exactly what his fans want while pleasing no one still hoping for a surprise from the comedic actor.
Think how much better that little diatribe would be if we were watching *Polley's* reaction while hearing the *mother's* words.
I felt like I was watching public access theater for a while there.
If you are so desperate to watch this...then count backwards from 5 million and do it while chewing bubblegum and skipping rope, because you will enjoy it ten times more and it will make just as much sense.
There's really not much more to say other than that, but I'll try: Imagine being strapped to a chair while every stupid person who has ever irritated you, wasted your time, or otherwise caused you grief pokes you repeatedly in the face with a rolled-up copy of the National Enquirer while explaining the plot of Jason and the Argonauts to you using no words that contain more than two syllables.
So while the movie isn't that good it did at least stay consistent.
Somehow at the end of the film, Brad is contaminated with no signs of illness , while wife is seemingly going to be OK , while coughing through out , like a smoker that smokes 6 packs a day.
SubZero, while not as ambitious as Mask of the Phantasm is a very good film.
Being the nice girl she is, Clare goes to Arkham Hall and dribbles some of the blood into Sarah's mouth while she's sleeping.
And while Bill O'Reilly may not always say things that people like, he's certainly more worthy of the mantle of "bold" and "edgy" than the over-hyped and self-important Stephen Colbert.
the story with the clown made me wonder if I washed my feet today... too bad, this truly is a movie to see while washing your feet, so you can do something useful when the torment begins.
As it is, however, the film feels like something somebody came up with while tripping out on some really bad LSD.
And indeed if one were actually ON acid while watching it, the movie might possibly be funny.
The movie borrows much of its style from animated hits like "The Simpsons," "Beavis and Butthead," and "South Park," the only difference being that those works are actually funny while this is not.
In this film, Frylock wonders who his father and mother were, while a giant exercise machine takes over the town and makes Carl, the idiot human neighbor, buff.
One of the detectives, George (Lorne Brass) is a homosexual steeped in sadism and it is Marcel's determined efforts to keep the hidden money from the duo while fiercely struggling physically against them that comprise about half of a plot line which also focuses upon the young man's endeavour to repair a severed relationship with his dying father (Roger Le Bel).
One being decent while the other, well, read my first paragraph...
However, while "Driller Killer" has its share of frantic low-budget energy (the murders are photographed in a genuinely unsettling way), the script is simplistic and repetitive--seldom does it veer away from its exploitation surface sheen.
One of the main problems of the movie is that the people who think they will like it, generally won't, while those that might enjoy it probably would never pick it up in the first place.
Abel Ferrara - director of "Ms .45", "Bad Lieutenant", and "King of New York" - directed and stars as a struggling New York painter living a "Three's Company" lifestyle with two babes in a rat-hole apartment complex while desperately hoping to score some rent money with his next big 'masterpiece'.
The second thing i've noticed is that while some films used a lot of day for night shots where they attempt to convince you that it's nighttime when it's obviously daylight, and that's pretty stupid.
There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons.
The film opens with a very confusing sequence in which the protagonist is standing at an altar while being approached by an elderly man.
City hunter will entertain let's say 3 to 8 year olds who are not so bright and it makes one wonder how this scrap made it on DVD while a genuine masterpiece like "The fearless vampire killers" is still waiting for a DVD release.
Strengths of the film were Begnini's performance (though at times, it did come off as essentially the same guy he was in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) and the latter half of the film (while not great--it was light-years ahead of the first half).
- and while it feels free to drop in "famous" Shakespearian quotes from other plays at any convenient turn for the amusement of the adult audience, it could have used a few more in the actual plot without turning off the younger set), but it is coherent and even in "smoothing out" the rough edges of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies for overly sensitive parents, it preserves the essence of most of Shakespeare's lessons (at least as interpreted these 400 years later).
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
I first learned of this film back in the early 1980's, while watching an episode of the "Siskel and Ebert" movie review show on PBS.
Even better is his feigned indifference when he realizes Dorothy stands him up, while waiting beneath the huge clock at the union.
The clerk who sold me my ticket said that while most of the younger audiences seemed to love the film, many middle-aged moviegoers had left the film enraged, demanding to be refunded.
It's taken four or five films, but it seems like Hollywood has run of out occupations for Will Ferrell to have while he acts like a man child.
Both David Strathairn and Samuel L. Jackson ("Pulp Fiction") are hard pressed to do anything with their limited roles, Halle Berry shows she's on the rise with a convincing portrayal of Khaila, while Jessica Lange is strong but she's been infinitely better.
It does take a while to get going and the ending does feel slightly rushed but "Gregory's Girl" is a movie worth watching.
And while it wasn't horrendous, I found myself getting more and more fatigued as it went along.
After a few brushes with her furry friends, Kim is understandably freaked out and skittish (while her husband, with increasing annoyance, considers her a lunaticÂwho knew husbands were so eager to consider their wives plumb nuts?
), which makes it surprising that she doesn't seem phased in the least when, at the height of her nervousness, the lights in the bathroom go out while she's taking a shower.
In addition to never considering just bolting up the chimney again during the day, while the little men are sleeping, which is the only method that obviously worked in the past.
Her friend, Geraldine Ferraro, finally believes her, but still has no problem leaving her alone (while drugged!)
The North Pole set looks like it was constructed as a one-off for John Stewart's Daily Show while chez Bernard is Texan soap-leased.
it points out that Moore denounces the epidemically separating rich and poor while being himself "a rich white man."
But while Moore used the shrinking US job market as an entry point into a career exposing the economic slavery being imposed on this nation (and others), this fellow chooses to attack a man that should very well be a hero to his father and surely his own self.
Nothing here but a boring and desperate attempt to convince us that everything is fine in America, while trying to make Moore an America hater and a liar, in a country that is full up to the neck, with lies.
Wilson puts the spotlight on himself by showing us his family photos at the beginning and portraying himself as intrepid reporter on the beat throughout while complaining that Moore is making films about himself.
The first is that while the alien female cast is definitely attractive (and I am not saying the human cast isn't), but it appears as if someone had instructed them to try and act seductively while playing a part and they just end up coming across like the actors in the crappy porn movies my flatmates used to find amusing.
After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK.
The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor.
For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him.
In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly.
The film has something to do with Satan's wish to recruit her character's husband, while a number of people get in the way.
Ina Balin co-stars for better or worse while Victor French ('Mr.
Jake and Siton set out to go skirt chasing in some domestic and foreign locales, while Siton's evil brother, Lickapon, and his thugs follow their every move.
in a cocky, self-confident tone so the film's entire fanbase can cackle delightedly at how daring he is, while, apart from those two people, everyone else can hold their heads and moan.
Maybe the director thought that things were getting a little too violent and exciting, so he decided to let us rest for a while by letting us look at a lizard on a tree.
As much as I like her, by the end of this movie, I had the desire to duct tape her to a theatre chair while I extracted my fifteen bucks from her purse that I paid to see this train derailment of a teen flick.
Toward the end when the boyfriend avoids her for a while, it was merely yawn-inducing.
This movie may have given cinema an iconic character in its visualisation of Count Dracula Â every kid ever to do a vampire impression has used Bela Lugosi's accent Â and the film is undeniably influential, but, like Boris Karloff's creature in the same year's similarly overrated 'Frankenstein', Lugosi has very little to do besides stand still and stare a lot while someone shines a torch in his eyes.
I submitted a review for 'The Big Swindle' - a 2 hour long Korean heist move - and mentioned that I always seem to find winners while watching random Korean movies.
It is filled with scenes which are so foreseeable and they drag on for long time with many perspectives which repeat on and on while the soundtrack tries to wake some emotions.
The scene drags on for long time, emotional soundtrack joins the scene, many perspectives are taken of the hero getting a tear - and all while the bad guys still fire at them.
By the last 30 minutes I was looking for a hard surface to bash my head against while yelling at the actors to DO SOMETHING!
The plot (if it can be describe as such) was risible and must have had about 30 seconds thought put into it while the screenwriter was waiting for his coffee.
I remember going to the cinema to watch 'Grease',while 'Gregorys Girl 'was the support.
What an anti climax when 'grease' came on while my mind kept flashing back to the wonderful ,previous film i had watched before.
There was a bit of controversy while the film was being shot here--Hopkins HATED working with Derek because she refused to rehearse.
For the first time in quite a while, I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life.
Interesting that Wenders professed that while making 'Paris Texas', he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script.
The producers obviously thought that they can get away with a hit by borrowing the title and the character's name of Ninja Scroll while adding heaps of excessively disgusting scenes to the film.
Even while tinkling the ivories in the new happy ending, he still seems like a self- absorbed brooder.
I saw this film while in Europe, and was extremely unimpressed.
Cage--encouraged to overact--mugs for laughs, while the finale (with the flying Elvis-impersonators) was used as the film's sole advertising gimmick.
And while your at it, Hollywood: stop with all the Elvis imitations.
Gregory's sister is the one with the fashion sense and is the guiding hand in trying to sort out his love life while its Gregory who is the petulant immature one when confronted by his sisters' young admirer at the front door.
The movie is so raunchy, the camera style just feels like an excuse to portray various people in inappropriate sexual situations while trying to call it "art."
This girl killed a god (or at least a man perceived as one) for Imhotep, and she has already been brought back to life, still she freezes in fear while our brave (and beautiful) Rachel Weizs races to the rescue.
While there are adult characters in the film (most notably the coach, who is himself awkward and hardly authoritative), and while we meet Gregory's dad briefly, they come off as backdrop, and the overall impression is that this is like a live-action, Scottish, adolescent version of Charles Schulz's 'Peanuts' movies, where kids run about on their own seemingly at whim after school, but aren't necessarily concerned with being full of destructive mischief given that freedom.
It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all.
After all, it does have Boris Karloff playing the Baron for onceÂeven if, for some strange reason, he is named Victor here while his notorious ancestor is called Richard!!
Still, even here - with the haphazard appearance of the Baron, whose misshapen face apparently gets "lifted" every once in a while!
His nosey servant Shuter (Norbert Schiller) provides the brain & heart, however while handling the eye's Frankenstein drops them.
But little Davey also gets himself hit by a car while chasing his dad.
But alas, I am clearly in the minority, this show has stood the test of time with countless re-runs on BBCtv, UK Gold, and while I stand to be corrected, even on Paramount Comedy.
Its attempt to be "fair and balanced" is about as fair and balanced and believable as Fox cable news; it pokes witty and intelligent fun at strident liberals, while taking cursory potshots at greedy bankers who foreclose on cute visionary land developers.
Having thus seduced them into bliss, she exits with her man, while the shrewish liberal harpy who'd exploited her worst of all now finds her own happy ending onstage, crowing out a song which succinctly condemns every facet of humanity without discretion, or any sense at all.
In "The Californians" the characters appeared unaware of the importance of the world around them while wandering aimlessly through their own, increasingly trivial, lives.
DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funny  This is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similar  The comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage like  The spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrived  The ending is the worst part of the film  Direction by DD is bad Music is ordinary  Camera-work is only saving grace  Amongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly
According to my video store, they get home movies like this every once and a while and sometimes they slip through the cracks and get on the shelf.
The storyline is very weak (concerning two young girls' search for the perfect guy), while the serious and moral content makes very little impact.
This brings to mind a previous comment by another user: "why does Amanda Bynes insist on one of those crap 'dancing like a berk while trying on clothes' montage scenes in every film she's ever made?"
Unfortunately, while there is something to some of the plot, this Italian film also has a lot against it.
But after a while I got the impression she was just glorying in her martyrdom as the long suffering wife.
It was the first programme in a while that I couldn't sit all the way through, I even thought there was funny moments in the 'Green Green Grass' (only fools spin off).
SheÂ´s already made her point by staying on the phone with the guy while both her life and BosleyÂ´s as well as the whole mission were at stake.
As a Zeppelin fan I am all for improvisation as long as it adds to, while improving the song.
The Tattooist starts in Singapore where American tattooist Jake Sawyer (Jason Behr) is attending a tattoo festival, while there he sees an attractive woman named Sina (Mia Blake) & he follows to a traditional Samaon tattooing session.
There's a Asian ghost story kind of feel about it as some vengeful ghost kills a few people & wants the world to know about the wrongs done to them while they were alive & the whole tattooing angle is just awful.
Then there's that little fat kid who can contact ghost's while driving along listening to a bad rap song, there are some bad moments here.
Why does she call him "Manuel" while he calls himself "Chico"?
The movie's alternate English title VIOLATION OF THE BITCH has to do with the scene where Chico proves his love to the lady of the house by apparently buggering her while the family is over for a dinner party.
The problem is that the movie -- while as sleazy as they come -- isn't really sick or demented enough to warrant some of it's reputation, and reading over some of the other comments here I wonder if perhaps the version I saw on a PAL format DVD may have been missing some scenes.
Yet he has immortality and can regenerate after death, all while walking in daylight and not needing blood.
The dogs are supposed to be scary and while the scenes where they are on the attack have an urgency to them, its just hard picturing these pups as anything but cute and cuddly.
After efficiently burning the bodies of the Dracula clan from the collapsed tomb, they pinpoint Veidt's empty coffin and second-guess his fiendish intentions, but Gad...did they have to discuss the exact address of Michael Drake, the last living Dracula, while Veidt was lurking in the shadows???
Holding one's breath while waiting for this day to come is not advisable.
"Killer Nun" is a disappointing Italian nunsploitation film that offers only a little bit of sleaze and nudity.Another serious flaw in the film is the relationship between Sister Gertrude and Sister Mathieu which only hints at lesbianism.During these scenes Ekberg appears frigid while Paola Morra feels more relaxed doing these moments.
I first became aware of this via the Blue Underground DVD, though I was not intrigued enough by the online reviews to acquire it; however, coming my way recently while being in a "Nunsploitation" frame-of-mind, I could not very well let the opportunity pass me by (in hindsight, the English dubbing is atrocious Â even if the print reverted for a couple of brief scenes to the original Italian language).
Every once in a while a very bad film comes along and renews my faith in the sport of watching terrible schlock and having a wonderful time of it.
The acting is amongst some of the worst I've seen in a while, especially from Dennis Rodman.
It looked like there was no story and they came up with (bad) ideas while shooting.
Rodman lets himself fall down a long column, while he holds himself onto it with his legs, because he needs his arms for shooting.
Director Browning was obviously working on a low budget & the infrequent action scenes vary, some are very good & well choreographed while other's are slow & sluggish.
The acting is pretty poor, there are lots of dodgy hair-dos & moustaches while the actor who plays Chuck the cop is a William Shatner look-a-like.
The oldest of the three children is referred to as "Kansas" at one point, and is even called "Man of Steel" while surfing.
However, whenever there was a serious/suspenseful information-revealing type of moment in the movie, the camera would linger on her face for ages while Scarlett's eyebrows furrowed and lips quivered while we waited for her to give a breathless answer of some sort.
Or, when poor cop Josh Hartnett and socialite Hillary Swank engage in carnal relations in a seedy motel, and afterwards, as he, sitting in bed, is lighting up cigarettes for the two of them while she cuddles near him, is still wearing his fedora while she still wears her pearls.
Hillary Swank came off as a bad drag queen impersonator while we find out too late why Aaron Eckhardt's character is in such turmoil over the death of the Black Dahlia.
There were parts of the book that got left out which shouldn't have been, while there we're other parts 'put in' that could've been 'left out'.
The love scene, between Swank and Harnett, is just as amusing with Bleichert and Linscott having a little pillow talk while she's wearing nothing but huge pearl earrings and a long matching necklace with pearls the size of small onions, ensuring, I would imagine, a rather bumpy ride.
And while you're at it, Bucky, take out a couple of those clown paintings, please.
And all the while, goofy and upbeat music plays helpfully in the background, reminding us that this is a stupid kid's movie.
It had been a while since I had last watched it and I had an easier time remembering the elevator death than what the actual story was about.
  Trapped was how I felt while watching the film Entrapment.
After a while, the term really doesn't have much meaning anymore.
Here we get an endless 100 minutes of an unappealing actor trying to hide he's a psychopath (a character as supposedly smart as the woman in this movie should have been able to tell after her first conversation with him, but like the rest of the movie, she remains stone still with a concerned look on her face while he has any number of freak outs), mixed with clumsily directed murder scenes, and an ridiculously repetitive and drawn-out final twenty minutes.
Oddly, however, while this is definitely a horror film featuring Mantan reacting to zombies and the like again and again, his antics weren't nearly as offensive as usual.
So, while Moreland might have been a negative role model in one way, in another he showed that a Black man can be very bright and articulate as well (now THAT'S a first in film).
Parts of this film are gory while violence over shadows the horror.
Meanwhile, the so-called legal medicine men turn a blind eye while working cheek by jowl with presumed deviant sex slayers.
After a short while I stumbled on to the DVD entitled "Freak Show".
The problem seems to be pacing--this version seems content to hit a so-so joke every couple of minutes, while the original was much more consistently funny.
First, while Hill aged rather well, Spencer looks significantly older than he actually was, much as if he was sick or something.
Unfortunately for the audience Dracula's Curse has none of this, the production design amounts to some bland shotguns, a basement & a few rooms in a house while I can't remember a single action set-piece.
Technically the film is an eyesore, while a lot of films have certain colour schemes to look stylish Dracula's Curse just looks as if sometime turned the colour settings down on your telly & it just looks bland & lifeless throughout.
Film takes place over a couple days' time, while Sarandon and her eccentric brood await the news of her soldier-son, but the picture has no particular viewpoint, it's just a melodramatic passel of scenes.
It's been a while since i laughed so much while watching a romantic comedy.
Oil man Hank Anderson (Paul Newman) warns tycoon Shelby Gilmore (William Holden), Kay Kirby (Jacqueline Bisset), and everybody else booked in Holden's luxury resort motel to clear out while the getting's good.
The film opens with the same-old row-call: Paul Newman is an oil drill foreman who falls for advertising exec Jacqueline Bisset, who was offered an engaging ring earlier by millionaire William Holden; James Franciscus is the owner of the island's hotel who refuses to believe the upcoming threat, while not exactly being faithful to his clueless (read: foolish) wife Veronica Hamel.
You see, while I might not have seen this particular movie before, I can certainly recognise Irwin Allen's distinctive signature on celluloid.
The behind-the-scenes crew must've kept their mouths shut while filming the Irwin Allen production, knowing that the final product was going to be garbage.
This movie was encouraged to be filmed at the time because Irwin Allen still had one film left on his contract to be directed and the film studio wanted to get their money's worth while they could.
If that seemed unconvincing, you should see the red lights the film crew strategically placed on the ground to make it look like the heat of the lava is being reflected off the casts' faces while being sprayed with water bottles to make it look like they're sweating.
"), his dodgy partner James Franciscus tries to play down the threat of the local volcano blowing up while Paul Newman's wildcat oilman insists "This thing's a goddamned powder keg" with what little enthusiasm he can muster between romancing Jacqueline Bisset's advertising designer with tales of how he earned the money to start drilling (and not just for oil, we're informed) by teaching women needlepoint.
James Goldstone, who had turned out some pretty decent efforts in the past, directs like it was a 70s TV movie while Fred Koenekamp's cinematography doesn't hide the fact that the grand finale was shot on a soundstage.
All you see are her head, hands, and feet while she tumbles into the lava.
while the four Harvard roommates sit around wiping away their tears because they don't have anything better to do.
I would have sneaked into the bum's room while he was asleep, opened his bottle of liquor, poured the alcohol all over him, and set him on fire.
The story is weak, acting is terribly bad (or maybe this movie is without acting at all) even for such kind of movies while dialogs look extremely silly and cheesy.
On opening weekend Saturday matinÃ©e there were about 15 people in the cinema and half of them walked out during the first 10 minutes while making loud offensive comments.
Once the forms are signed Dracula travels to London to take up residence in his new property which is situated next to a mental asylum run by Dr. Jack Seward (Harvey Korman) & as Dracula introduces himself he notices Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony) a friend of Seward's daughter Mina (Amy Yasbeck) & takes an unhealthy interest in her as he changes into a bat, flies into her room while she is asleep & drinks her blood.
As it is Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead (1982) or Dog Soldiers (2002), I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror.
best you can do while watching this movie is guessing which scene was stolen from which movie - so you could be able to stay awake.
Supposedly based on this Paganini document, the band produce a new (and equally awful) song, and decide to make a video-clip in Paganini's old mansion - The mansion in which the famous violin virtuoso had once signed a pact with the devil... Sound cheesy, and it is, but not only is it very, very dumb cheese, even though the film is only 80 minutes long, the temptation to fast-forward becomes bigger with each passing minute after a while.
Some movies, while corny, are delightfully so.
The crime scene was so outrageous and the idea that relatives would be allowed to live in the house while it's under police investigation is so unbelievable it's almost laughable.
A couple of choice scenes to demonstrate the cheeziness of this movie -- First, the scene in which Gooding gets all the inmates to tear up their playing cards while the inspirational music swells and you half-expect the cast to start the slow-unison clap from those awful highschool sports movies.
The closest this movie gets to genuinely creepy is a part were a girl is talking about impaling while sharpening a long wooden stick...but then she cuts a guy's eye open and what looks like jello-o squeezes out and it's back to the laughs.
A group of road tripping teens are caught in a car accident while being attacked by an unexpected swarm of insects--right off the bat showing just how much sense this movie makes.
After I saw this film, all I could muster was a "Yeah, and...." I guess my point is that Van Peebles is trying to muster up sympathy for black cinema actors while pointing the fingers at the mostly white movie studio and casting executives of that time, and, taking from his example, I could make a film which musters up sympathy for the white actors that were portrayed as extremely racist or prejudiced landowners or business people or action stars or in any other bad light just as easily.
The result being that in most scenes part or all of the speakers are off screen and sometimes the featured action as well, while most of the image is left empty.
When the wallet is lost a second time, while DeHavilland and Forsythe are at a nightclub, the comedy is supposed to be conveyed by the two actors yukking it up with stage laughter.
Forsythe's chatty buddy, who sounds like he's auditioning for a cartoon voice-over job, gets chummy with a senator and his wife while Forsythe has a confrontation with every person he talks to (he's far too intense and focused an actor to relax and be easy, and these fluffball surroundings have him looking like a deer in the headlights).
"Sabata" is really a cheap James Bond picture set in the west and I am sure Frank Kramer or should I say Gianfranco Parolini had that in mind while developing the project.
He escapes only to capture the people who he feels wrongly sent him to the asylum and leaves them out in the desert while he watch over them making sure they don't leave.
Harrelson and Riley play "good ol' boys" that tell lame jokes while playing the guitar.
The characters, while interesting, bear NO resemblance to the ones described on so many precious APHC broadcasts.
When Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep are talking about their family woes while Lily's daughter reads her bad poems about suicide, the stories are just outrageous enough that you can't tell if it's supposed to be a comic piece or character drama.
For example, studio executives use creative accounting to allow the non-union Jitlov to make his short while remaining out of union sight.
Big Monster on Campus is set ion Los Angeles where smart science student Frank Stein (Matthew Lawrence) has ideas about bringing the dead back to life, while at a party local nerd Karl O'Reilly (Ryan Reynolds) is confronted by cool high school dudes Lance (Justin Walker) & Tuttle (Christian Payne) & after an accident Karl ends up dead at the bottom of a swimming pool.
And while almost all the film he really acted no different from Elmer Fudd, at the very end, Bugs tricked the guy by getting him to 'shoot dice'--a typically sad and obnoxious stereotype from the 1940s that claimed Black people were lazy and all they wanted to do was gamble!!
Cinematographer Carlo Di Palma did his best to make the house look interesting, but that yellow and orange lighting scheme became oppressive after a while, and I was longing to step outside and see some daylight.
the entire shoot while the rest of the crew sat around snorting coke and going 'Zut Alors!
Holmes agrees & the plan is for him to travel with the King by plane while Watson acts as a decoy & travels to the Mediterranean country by boat.
There are only two highlights here--the death by the hood of a trunk and a nice shot of a guy's butt while going into a hot tub (it's rare you get any male nudity in a horror film).
Also, while the ending is vague the film makers don't follow the guidelines of a typical horror movie ending.
Watch the opening sequence and marvel out how shoddy the editing is: when one of the baddies fires at an officer, there is actually what looks like a break in the film (as if to chop a few frames out) followed by a painfully out-of-sync death scene of the fat officer- ooph!- getting plugged by a bullet, which apparently stopped in mid-air for five seconds while the camera crew switched reels.
You just can't hold a rope while somebody is descending, it has to be anchored.
So, this Indian guide leads our heroes down into the cave, and they all decide to have a party while their in the bowels of the earth.
Think about it for a minute: would YOU be able to act scared, or even concerned, while being chased by a giant puppet?
After a while, we gathered enough patience to sit down and watch all the movie.
All the while Cab and the cops watched the stage, but monster trucks and a storm proved the perfect distraction; the Blues brothers and the band manage to elude the cops at a local tent revival, with the Reverend Cleophus James.
I saw this on afternoon TV a while ago and i sat the whole show with my mouth open with disbelief.
After watching this episode I somehow felt the urge to smoke a pot and drink alcohol while having sex with a prostitute and screaming "Jesus hates you".
When I first saw an episode of this series, it seemed quiet funny to me: a sexless-Christian-perfect-family-universe with countless daughters who are each engaged for about the 20th time while not ever having married, and in the end, the parents ly in bed and cry because their son wants to marry a Jewish girl.
Otherwise, this is a good movie to spend $8.00 on to just talk while it plays.
The accomplice then grabs some shrub-shears and snips some hair off the dude's head while muttering the grammatically incorrect statement, "I am barber."
One of them distracts a girl by hitting a piano key, while the other sneaks up behind her for an ass-grab.
20) In another scene we have the following dialogue:  Girl 1: "Once in a while you own clothes."
Its cool, but nothing new, that they told the story by methodically revealing the scenes of the character's past while they live in their presently tragic situation.
But, while the clothes and styling somewhat matches the different times of the actors lives, the movie doesn't use color enough to distinguish them.
The detoxification of the female drug addict (Daris Mejias) is one of them, very powerful and emotional, and the acting of young Ivan(Kamar De Los Reyes) while he is having some problems with his wife in his NYC is Good (along with Roselyn) making for a decent scene.
She is driven there by her parents, her mom being the one eager to see her daughter off, while her father is less than thrilled with the idea.
(They come in the first 15 minutes and while never explicitly stated, they're pretty hard to miss.)
Barbara Stanwyck, while possessing a hot figure for a 50 year old woman (at the time), was definitely pushing the borders with her looks.
The number of Oscars they won, totaling six - two for Davis and four for Hepburn - meant nothing because Hepburn won one for MORNING GLORY, which is now a historical curiosity, and one for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, which she knew was a joint one for herself and Spencer Tracy, while Davis' first Oscar was not for Joyce Heath in the badly written DANGEROUS.
and while Hepburn seemed to be too much the social snob (even in PAT AND MIKE or DESK SET?)
At first the doctor sees no reason to pay her at all; after a while, he offers a token payment of "a few shillings" a week.
There are some sight gags on psychedelically painted cars and the bizarre couture of the freeloaders (and the family of eleven Mexican client claiming whiplash, all wearing neck braces) and the surprise that a casket stuffed into the back of the psychedelic car Fine has while his car is in the garage doesn't fall out.
Why would you watch a film Â whether or not realized in the Communist Soviets Â about the exploration of an empty planet while numerous contemporary Sci-Fi flicks handle about dangerous Martian missions or even the invasion of our own planet by ill-tempered aliens?
The movie is worth watching if not just for the funky, brightly colored psychedelic photography while on Venus.
This movie tries, and any movie with Yoko Tuni can't be all bad, but the special effects, while ambitious, are pretty lame.
The actors are quite often a real pain to behold, especially the black astronaut who probably was simply the only black man they had in East Germany, and who is so miserable, that the director, on his more sane moments, has wisely asked him to turn his back to the camera while delivering his dialog.
The goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it.
Well i have literally just got back from watching this movie and while i wouldnt say it was awful, i wouldnt put it up there with Lord of the Rings or any other great films!
When you watch an episode, please remember that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.
They appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane.
You can not put this thing into any genre, while you are watching you can not see any action, any science fiction or you can not laugh either.
The film, while American, set in Connecticut and shot in Canada, feels almost foreign, as if it were set in Germany, for example.
i will be very careful while getting American comedy films/shows.
If you're looking for something really offbeat, this is it, just be prepared to feel uncomfortable while watching it.
Plot's the one about the two comrades who find the home turf awash in crime and, while taking on the baddies, one gets killed, so the other sets out beyond the limits of the law to avenge his buddy - by donning a black mask, raiding the hideout singlehanded, making off with the swag, and giving all to the church save just enough to provide for his pal's surviving family.
Worse still, filler at least used to be action material, but here most of it is Soap Opera, recurring diversions into the Private Emotional Relationships of the two detectives, the hero and his wife, the hero-plus-wife and the victim's three children (who, as per tradition, they take in to raise as their own), while the advertising sets us up for cop action.
Except a TV show can play with nonsense and poor action scenes as a trademark, while in a 90-minutes bona fide caper movie it's bound to be a failure.
OK that's not a bad thing, but the comedy is fast wooden while the action suffers from it.
"The Woods" is David Ross' debut as scriptwriter, and while of course it shows some of the common problems of a first time writer, it also shows that Ross knows his influences very well (in more than a way, the story is a homage to Argento's "Suspiria").
Leading the cast is Agnes Bruckner as Heather, and while nothing amazing, she carries the film and makes us care for her character.
And while pretty spectacular, why did they drive on the roof of the arena?
And how did the crime lord get the news that they stole the gold while they were still making their get-away (cellphone?)?
And while it is definitely a fun ride, it's a bit on the disappointing side.
Hall is clearly less concerned about emoting a performance, but then again, she's been around for a while.
The plot was predictable, the emotional outbursts obviously phony, and the only thing comforting about this movie was to see the attractive face of 'Ray-J' Norwood step into a scene and make the young teenage girls and boys scream to the top of their lungs while watching it in their rooms (at least someone enjoyed it).
And the costumes for the grand finale, especially, are embarrassingly ridiculous (and quickly take the `grand' out of it)-- particularly the white dress Merman wears while delivering the title song; a creation so horrendous it defies description.
some other points:   - they have studied us for a while, decided to destroy us and suddenly change their mind because of what?
Along with her adopted son Jacob (Jaden Smith), the group attempts to try and stop the impending destruction, while the government chases after them.
Smith, while playing to his age, seems to be aping his father a little too much.
Jon Hamm and Kyle Chandler are given such a small amount of work to do that one must wonder why the filmmakers went with recognizable faces in their roles, while John Cleese and James Hong have such short scenes that you may blink and miss them altogether.
The scriptwriter has taken the original script, and rewrote it while apparently stoned or on coke.
McKee is aiming at lyricism, and while we should expect that plot is also served, in this film it is secondary.
It hits Earth and out of the sphere comes a being named Klaatu emerges from the sphere while accompanied by a large robot.
It's so awful, I was stunned into stillness while the rest of the audience seemed to shrug their shoulders.
In the end, while the movie is aesthetically pleasing, not enough attention was paid to developing a plausible story, well-drawn characters, or a satisfying ending.
The displaced Heather becomes close friend of he weird Marcy Turner (Lauren Birkell), while they are maltreated by the abusive mate Samantha Wise (Rachel Nichols).
The Southern people, while often retaining their traditional values of faith in God and a deep mistrust of the government, have largely evolved into a cosmopolitan, technology-driven population.
White and company--with silent, superfluous concrete Christ in tow--spend more time babbling about their own "weighty" insights and showcasing their own music (sometimes while local ragamuffins stare in staged wonder at these "furriners" explicating their little southern souls in song) than in actually interacting with the "natives."
Ozzie swallows one coin, and they hide the rest, while taking one to a Pawn Shop Owner (John Volstad) to see if they are valuable, and obviously Leprechaun kills the collector to get his first coin back.
A leprechaun is accidentally freed from his crate and from this moment onwards he terrorizes a household while searching for his gold that was stolen from him.
I was thinking to myself while watching it, why am I putting myself through a second viewing.
My brother even fell asleep while watching this.
However, it may be worth while to watch for a couple of reasosn.
I personally thought it was worth while just for that.
There's a whole genre of teen sex comedy (which tries to tease the audience while dancing around the fact that they can't really show very much) that loses a lot of its impact once you've actually "lost it" yourself.
This movie in my opinion was trying to go for the music, not he plot, while in the first one, it had a plot but the music wasn't as good as the second one.
The Real world is no doubt the most overrated TV show in television history, to say it's better than classics like sanford and son, all in the family, the dick van dyke show and the jeffersons is a joke, those who think of it, must be on some kind of acid trip, The Real world basicially made generation x go stale and teens bore to death, to compare this one to trauma life in the er is like comparing a alvin and the chipmunks to the smurfs trauma is about real life situations, while the real world is about stupidity eric nies is the most cheesist actor ever and the rest are terrible The real world along with many talk shows are the beginning of the downfall of TV in America.
Unfortunately, all of the characters are so boring that after a while you stop caring who's doing what to whom.
The basic plotline is this: young girl becomes possessed by the spirit of her dead mother while left in the care of her tyrannical father.
Spaghetti Western regular Aldo Sambrell is curious casting for the unsympathetic vengeful head of the family and his sluttish wife (whose spirit possesses the teenage lead) is not all that attractive either (which did not prevent her from getting it on with the novice while still alive)!
But you know you are in trouble in the first minute of the film, when rocker Joan Armatrading tries to channel Joan Baez with an utterly tuneless ballad while a 007-ish title sequence flashes up images of suffering Africans.
I was forced to endure this film a while ago, and can honestly say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen.
The characters make cardboard seem fully rounded, mostly being off-cuts from the Quentin Tarantino "chirpy-arrogant-violent-criminal-with-no-regard-for-anyone-else" block, while the script was abysmal.
He also befriends drifter Stacy Keach, whom he first meets while Keach is causing a drunken disturbance in a greasy spoon.
Barrett's fall from tired, hard working wife to slightly embittered mother who wants her daughter to drop out of school and work full time (while taking night classes), is also nicely subtle.
We can give all the kindness in the world to our family, friends and partners, but if we ignore the opportunity to help someone we haven't brought into our lives, it takes away from our importance while here on this earth.
Croatia's song started off with some bagpipe music while the entries from Greece and the United Kingdom sounded more Turkish than the entry by the Turks .
I guess I shouldn't be too disappointed since the Greek contestant had the best legs and she won while Romania had the best cleavage and she came third with the Israeli motek also doing very well .
Greece and Cyprus give each other twelve points while the Balkan , Baltic and Scandinavian countries scratch each others backs .
It's totally ridiculous as is the fact that while only 24 countries take part a total of 39 countries vote .
I got a very creepy feeling while watching it and confess, I did not finish the whole film.
Dodd is hardly the example to hold up as someone fighting to fix the credit industry in America, but "Maxed Out" tries, while attempting to demonize President Bush at every turn.
Apparently it worked for a while, but they differed on the terms of the sponsorship and eventually the arrangement dissolved.
The students claim they wanted to educate students on smart borrowing while the credit companies had other ideas.
This movie will probably stay in my "worst 10" list for a while.
why are all the actors laughing while Reading their lines???
The story is not intricate, but the movie is so slow that one finds it difficult to follow... Bullitt gets off the taxi, taking all the due time; then he calmly walks toward the parking area; he opens the door of a car; after a while, he shuts the door of the car; he broods over something for another long while (there's no hurry!
Lewis plays a girl who gets caught up in these crazy circumstances and never seems to get things right, while Pitt plays this mean nasty character who takes advantage of this poor girl.
Any feminist who watches this movie will be blown away by the absurd amount of machismo in this... men posture and posture more, while the women cower in fear and wait to be saved.
Second problem was that I obviously wasn't part of the target audience - the movie felt very childish with all the WWE fight scenes, illogical series of events that doesn't deserve to be called a plot, lack of graphical violence while being an action movie etc.
Our bulletproof walk-through-walls baddie gets one of his sidekicks to blow up a school bus full of kids, then gets the police to follow the radio signal back to the happy clappy hide out with orders to kill everyone, while he waits about upstairs.
But for me it was just plain boring, I was waiting all the while for something to happen, but nothing happened.
I can imagine some people liking the ending, in which a bunch of believers miraculously keep singing praise while they should be burning (and in my opinion they should be, regarding the performance they delivered).
The movie is wall to wall sex and after a while it stops being a Women in prison movie and just becomes a softcore (slightly hardcore) porno.
It's full of fun and interesting characters, has a much more substantial story and while there are fewer sex scenes and less nudity, what's there has a greater impact than anything "Bare behind bars" has to offer.
More than thirty years later, while moving an old filing cabinet, Rock discovered some business documents which enabled him to prove that 'Krakatoa' was his film ... and to claim his Oscar several decades late.
As a matter of fact, while the film has a couple of choice moments in its second half, any good intentions are done in by some serious miscasting: an overage Artful Dodger (Sonny Ray) and Nancy (Doris Lloyd) and, worst of all, an unsympathetic Oliver (Dickie Moore).
it's just a shame that they can't be enjoyed while viewing them.
And I've always wondered, why do monsters in movies like this always kill people while they are engaged in carnal relations?
The story and performances sucked me in from the beginning and held me there while the unbearable sadness of the final scene tore my heart out.
During a particularly depressed part of my adulthood, while I was grappling with the reality of having an unloving father, one day I found myself thinking about this movie.
Petrified is about an artifact that turns out to be an alien who comes back to life and turns some people to stone while draining others of blood.
She stands around watching the other players in most scenes she's in, and once was even asked by Lockwood's character to go watch the fish in the aquarium while he hooked up with the Filipinos.
Nielsen's John Trevor, longing for the peaceful life he gave up the chance for long ago, decides he's had enough- he wants out, and escapes to Manila suffering withdrawal from The Program's brain-altering chemicals all the while.
They seem to be trying to remember their choreography while the opponents wait to be punched.
Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here, however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off, and while he was likable, he just seemed to be going through the motions, however i still Love Lundgren , and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!
"Six Feet Under" & "The West Wing" are bound to be a re-run once in a while, right?  
But not only because of her role - she also got to kick much more ass in that one, while the script of "Intent To Kill" is poorly written.
kept echoing through my skull as I shifted uncomfortably while cringing.
I normally can overlook those while watching B-movie horror but in this case it all worked for the worse.
A woman must put her life back together while chasing after a homicidal killer clown murders her son in this excruciatingly bad exercise in tedium masquerading as a horror film.
I mean a Hitler with transvestite attitude and jerking off while in the middle of a fight etc.
Instead of any legitimate acting, we get a lot of self-important posturing while dialogue is delivered so forcibly that you can see the lines leap right off the script pages.
The camera work is obviously rock video influenced, something which unfortunately passes for mise-en-scÃ¨ne these days, while the gore effects are used strictly for shock value in place of any real scares.
Wellman's picture was a gritty, artistic masterpiece, while this clunker is nothing more than a stock gangster film with barely a good quality to speak of.
Mafia Vs Ninja has many fights, but no monks, no temples, no pupils nor masters, while there is a fair share of ninja attacks and kung fu fights that aren't always cheesy.
Christian Bale, a Harvard Medical School graduate, is bored having sex his fiancÃ©e, Kate Beckinsale, also a Medical School graduate working on another degree, in his mothers', Frances McDormand, glass and redwood mansion in the Hollywood Hills, which, instead of being vacated, is occupied by his record producer mother recording a British rock band while having sex with the very much younger lead singer.
(this is my first IMDB comment BTW, after using this site for years)  I found this movie the worst movie I've seen in a while (I've gotten good at avoiding them).
I found the movie a little redeeming because it's quite easy to make fun of it while you watch it.
I've always argued that Christian Bale, while he chooses interesting projects and, on the whole, good movies, is not a very versatile actor.
Akshay Khanna is good as usual, while Priyanka Chopra needs a complete makeover with her clothes, make up, acting...she needs lots of improvements.
So, we had Debra Messing and Dermont Mulroney a short while ago in a decent little romantic comedy called the wedding date, which was just above average content and humor wise, and brought up to decent by great acting by all the actors as well as the fantastic atmosphere set up by the film's location and- You must be wondering why I'm giving the review of a Hollywood movie in a bollywood forum.
In what looked like the complete reverse of the situation at the end of "Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid", it appeared that Pembroke's bunch had the entire Rebel garrison at Holman surrounded, managing to destroy everything in sight while picking off a swarm of soldiers who never seemed to be seeking cover from all the gunfire.
The second has Red Riding Hood becoming a fitness fanatic who is desperate to lose her virginity with her boyfriend while being pursued by The Big Bad Wolf (who just wants his medication back..) Lastly, in the best of the trilogy, Goldilocks is transformed into a homicidal maniac with psychic powers who has just escaped from a loony bin along with 'The Three Bears' and is on the run from the police.
Via a lame, low-budget framing device, a 'randy' uncle tells his restless nephew fairy tales in an attempt to get the brat to go to sleep (I, however, had no trouble falling into a somnambulant state while watching this).
Milton Subotsky was the producer of some of the finest British horror in Amicus productions like the flawless "Dr Terror's House of Horrors", while Price and Carradine are two of the greatest actors in the genre.
Then, after some events that involves a small robbery and a video tape with scenes from a previous encounter between Ana and FabiÃ¡n, both girls have to go after Rocco but with different intentions: while Alicia tries to find him to make up her mind about the marriage, Ana tries to recover the tape so Alicia won't find out.
Also the use of fancy, rapid editing was way overused and after a while seemed only there to give it a sophisticated look.
In the film, while Sir Thomas tries to scold his son for these faults, Tom takes him to task for his activities in Antigua.
We never get to see the outing to Sotherton and, while we do see Maria flirting relentlessly with Henry, we never see him playing one sister off against the other.
Mary starts caressing Fanny, while Edmund watches with his eyes almost popping out of his head.
I am typing these comments while consuming a can of beer.
I was rummaging in my old things a while back and pulled out a bunch of old movies.
The content become contrived and predictable after a while.
While I was watchng this movie I couldn't help but think that while Peter Scolari was filming this "Friday the 13th meets Arachnaphobia" low budget horror, his "Bosom Buddies" co-star, Tom Hanks, was off earning an oscar for Forrest Gump.
All of this put together does make Ticks a worth while 85 minutes to spend watching it.
I'm having trouble even putting in to words what it was that is wrong with this movie, so bear with me while I try my hardest...
In this movie it looks like she is desperately trying to recreate being stoned, funny and yet still managing to be cute while clinging desperately to a mid-20 something youthfulness.
The "stoner" encounters unusual people and situations while under the influence.
However, while the forest locations are certainly nice, the unexciting main narrative involving rival logging companies and the unavoidable love triangle really drown the interest; a subplot involves a villainous moonshiner who's a dead ringer for Walter Brennan Â and, for the record, there's even an interminable "Jazz Age" party sequence towards the beginning!
Overall, "Click," while it is a very nice piece of work, just doesn't click for me.
Daniels is able to convey the contrasting aspects of their characters, while giving the "real" Gil a greater sense of solidity than the "unreal" Tom.
The first half is the Sandler brand of immature fart jokes, while the second half is a tragedy that seems perfect for date movies.
while not exactly the hamptons, it's a cheerful and appealing location, and to make a new york area crime film with such a basically false premise (even part of its title) is simply outrageous.
Deniro, "My dad's a baby killer, I haven't called you in a while, I lied that I do have a kid, oh and a grandson, oh and did I mention I'm a wife beater?"
Since I haven't had a good scare in a while I figured it should at least give me a jolt.
In Purple Rose Allen revisits his great love-hate relationship with Hollywood, and he creates a charming ode to Hollywood of the 30's while never neglecting to point out how naive and out of context it really was.
She looked every bit the 40's she was at the time of filming, and I have to say that she came across less funny than she did when I envisioned her character in my mind while reading the book.
The book's charm was in its varied vignettes and casual observations about a city straddling two mindsets: clinging to the decorum of the antebellum past while thriving in the pulsating, diverse present.
Deanna cries and sobs and looks hurt a lot, while otherwise amiable Kelly is forced to appear to be mean and insensitive.
I watched a lot of episodes, but after a while, I grew bored of it.
The only genuinely funny moment in 80 minutes is Morley's facial expression when Margaret Rutherford turns up and says "I've come to sit at your feet while my child is being born!"
Then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching TV or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim.
Ron Max is the lead and while he convinces as the psychopath, he isn't very charismatic and the performance feels a bit flat.
but after a while it made me long for a comedy like, say, Annie Hall or Manhattan (am I dating myself?)
Guy talking to monster while holding really big gun says: "Hey, Mr. Monster, I want you to meet my friend Tommy".
I love the cheap CGI insertions over old footage: while a 50 foot monster battles jets with rockets and buildings are being destroyed, directly below in the background, calm traffic is rolling back and forth like this happens every day.
Add to that conversations that are supposed to be 'real' yet are clearly not a part of the 'internal documentary,' and some poorly acted and staged scenes that are meant to illuminate the tale of Wenders' trip to Ray's bedside, while also trying and failing to break down narrative conventions, and you have a genuine disasterÂ.
In the first and most memorable scene in this movie, 'Jackson', while wearing a hockey mask and meandering around the streets of London one night, and grabs a guy from behind and peels back the flesh from his face and then punches a hole into the guy's chest and then rips out his heart.
Then, in the first of several changes in tone, we get annoying attempts at humour, where Jackson tries on cowboy hats in a store while still wearing his hockey mask, a cornball sequence where they go for a stroll on the beach one evening at sunset, while Jackson is still wearing his hockey mask(!)
This looks like home movies filmed on the streets in and around London on a pocket change budget in a few days time, while it might have had a valid point about the unoriginality of Hollywood, it was mostly brought down by the non existent budget and the dramatic changes in tone throughout the movie.
Yeah right, it would weigh a ton so the horses could not pull it for long, plus the Gatling gun could not be fired while moving.
Apaches, using rifles, are shooting in pure darkness, wearing "war paint" and traditional feather caps, while not moving around to disguise their location?
It was also an insult to portray the Apaches as "cold blooded killers" while they were fighting for their tradition, family and lives.
Why would the writer put a stupid schtick in a chase scene where one character throws an explosive and another character shoots the explosive in mid air while riding full out on a horse?
One can easily see why up-and-coming star O'Neal signed on for this movie: he gets to be the sensitive good guy while also protecting his helpless wife from the scary villain.
About 3 people have matching outfits, while the rest are just hodgepodges of random stuff spray painted silver to try to be more consistent.
Even "The Seventh Planet", in all its awfulness, did a better job of that while probably attempting to be somewhat serious sci-fi.
The central purpose or theme seems to be that human love can last but only with help from a group of god-like fairies who are able to move love from one person to another with the sprinkling of flowers while the human's sleep.
I felt so sorry for her while watching this movie.
When I thought of it upon waking up this morning with my review gelling in my head (I usually watch films at night then think about them while I head off to sleep--reviews often pop up almost fully formed when I awake), I burst out laughing remembering the character.
But while it highlights Coogan's weaknesses as a conventional leading man and is very short on laughs without have a smart enough payoff to compensate, it's brisk and harmless enough.
Paul Anderson obviously hates the fans of the franchises and has been hating them for a while now.
This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??)
And while we're at it, let's change the way the Predators and Aliens look.
And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.
After a while you begin to think the title "Alien vs.
I've seen this movie a few times and while it does have it's moments, it also has some really fundamental flaws.
I kept waiting for one of them to pull out a cellphone because most the performances were phoned in, for me the beginning was the worse stupid twinkling lights in the background of scenes of them on the ship while long shots with harpies flying over head were of a cloudy twilight sky, so where did the twinkling stars come from....this is just pointing out one of many flaws and of course this ship was filmed in a studio with no water at all, I'm sure of it.
Vosloo is quite good as Obysseus, Bourne and Antonakos are OK in their roles but Edwards is terrible as Homer, not so much his performance as the fact that while the other characters are talking in a old style Homer speaks like a modern person and this jars every time he talks and finally Gibson is awful, completely wooden, but thankfully she isn't in it long.

Hard up for laughs, Long is written as a klutz, who trips, falls, spills, slides, and even at one point, undresses herself while trying to walk stairs.
Director Perry has people walking arm in arm and laughing gleefully, while entering rooms, or adjourning from others.
Johnny double-crosses Joe for reasons that I'm not going to get into because they're stupid, and later has to face Joe's new hustler Brad (played by a slumming Rick Schroder) in a high-stakes game of pool, while suffering from a broken wrist given to him by an angry Joe.
But they`re not any type of teenagers , no siree , instead of being the usual collection of bimbos and jerks one of the bimbos is in therapy and on prozac while the monster stalking them is Bigfoot !
Saw this on Sky Movies a while back and I have to say this is a total mess of a film.
(Pardon the social commentary, but it seems like mediocre talent who make ridiculous money like to hang out to ease their collective consciences for coasting through le dolce vita while everyone else works their asses off?)
while French is widely spoken in Algeria especially in academic institutions, Arabic is the official language and is the language of the street.
Flat, uninteresting characters and a poor attention to the supposed documentary style made this the worst use of my movie rental dollars in a while.
It was about these two people having to get along while going through the growth process.
The original had Fonda as a professor standing up to regent Eugene Palette to read a letter by Sacco of Sacco and Vanzetti while simultaneously battling Jack Carson as the faded college football star for the affections of DeHavilland.
This movie and Keaton's role as the bumbling fumbling crazy but serious idiot makes this movie what it is, while Henry Winkler and Shelly Long attempt to balance this hilarious riot comedy with some serious sides of what is a attempt of living a normal life, but infiltrated with Keaton's wit, (which is as sharp and funny spontaneously as any Robin Williams stand up comedy has ever been).
Keaton at his best, while his character is intensely amped up and nuts but serious.
This film, while early in their careers is just too weak, silly and in our internet-violent world just ridiculous.
Scenes are lifted from Scarface & Lethal Weapon & countless Hollywood flicks while the whole plot plus numerous scenes xeroxed straight from John Woo's classic Hong Kong flick "A Better Tomorrow".
I do know that the Eurovision song contest isn't supposed to be taken seriously as a song contest otherwise the 1990s would have seen Blur , Oasis or The Verve as the UK contestants while Ireland fielded U2 with Air representing France etc .
All the Nordic countries voted for one another while Greece and Cyprus gave each other maximum points as they do every year much to the disgust of the gathered audience in Turkey .
The killer in this movie is a mentally challenged boy witch doesn't have anywhere close the the horror appear that "Leatherface does" and while running around he constantly makes pig noises which I thought was just stupid and didn't add to the scare factor of the movie.
So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while.
Almost everything Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have ever written has been brilliant, we'll ignore the City Slickers sequel and The Flinstones, and this is one of their early movies which, while still hilarious, somehow didn't do that well at the box-office.
"Best Men" can't seem to make up its mind if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and scrambles both while compromising each only to cap the confusion with some mediocre action.
It's like an 18-act Italian opera taking place in the center ring of a three-ring circus while bears waltz and elephants stand on their heads on either side.
There are occasional pauses in the tumult while Anna and her friends seem to functioning normally, but the pauses are only there as lead-ins to the next bout of victimization.
The poor girl turns her head away in disgust while he shoots up.
He throws himself all over her, blubbering and pulling at her black slacks, while she squeals and manages to push him away.
For several minutes we watch her tattooed naked body before a bathroom mirror while she shaves her armpits, applies lipstick, and watches tears roll down her cheeks.
But while our two little wallflower protagonists find a whopping $2MY, the real score is in finding each other.
It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE.
This film version of that book has none of those qualities and while it is excellently designed and shot on a modest budget it lacks intelligence, wit and purpose: it is a pop music video.
Of course we are privy to this intent because we are told so by the plot, while characters in the story are given bits and pieces.
Unfortunately, the denouement of this intriguing setup involves the use of a heavy hammer to pound the tired message that US imperialism ruined the world while Soviet and Chinese socialistic benevolence could save it.
She and several others needed a way to make the money, while avoid two pimps who taking more than their shares of the profits.
In the 1970's, audiences escaped back to the more innocent and halcyon days of the 1950's through works such as "American Graffiti" and "Happy Days," while in the '80's, it was the '60's that got replayed, via "The Wonder Years" and "The Right Stuff."
After he learns that his parents will soon be going bankrupt if they can't find a way to pay for all the medical expenses they incurred while caring for their comatose son, Justin convinces his old break dancing buddies to come out of retirement and enter a contest, the winners of which will receive a whopping $100,000 in prize money.
The Allied agent suffers terribly while the German escapes.
After a while you start to believe he is Ol' Blue Eyes.
Some films from comics are rewarded while others are attacked, this film is like any other.
Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns.
The chemistry between Kevin Bacon & Fred Ward was vital to the success of the original & while Ward came back for Tremors II: Aftershocks even he is missing form this & it's up to minor character Burt Gummer to step up to the plate & carry the film, to be fair he is quite amusing at times & at least his sidekick Jack Sawyer is quite likable & not some silly comic relief buffoon.
The acting is OK, Michael Gross is amusing & has his character nailed down while the minor character's are all ably played.
Followed by the TV series & Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) while Tremors V: The Thunder from Down Under (2010) is listed as in production.
But it's enjoyable to turn on while paying your bills or doing the dishes.
and it keeps beating us on the head with it while showing us around out a lot of Louis Whatever hotel suites that few Americans in 1957 could afford either.
We wait, and wait, and wait while Astaire sings and Janis Paige (she's trying to be Jean Hagen) chews the scenery, for Astaire and Charisse to dance.
The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good.
(a couple of the four "acts" play out at the same time and while at first glance seeing both sides of a phone call in different segments seems novel, you realize that the timing would not allow Ted the bellhop to be in two places at the same time.)
This is really only bearable for a short while.
And when you're that bored, you start to question the point of watching scenes of kids sitting on the toilet, or hanging around the house naked while playing music.
), while the former follows her there on summing up the courage to finally express his love.
Billy is an idea man,(he wants to feed mayonaisse to tuna to simplify the process of having to mix the mayo with the tuna) while Chuck is seems less and less content spending time when he can alone with his neurotic girlfriend.
And we've all seen the standard electrocuted-in-bathtub death scene countless times before, scene, though instead of the usual hair dryer or radio being tossed in the tub, this time it's caused by a vibrator that one character plugs in and leaves sitting on the sink while she's taking a bath.
Also, while Chuck and Bill are having their fun, a pimp and his goon (Richard Belzer and Badja Djola)want to know where all of their girls have gone and why, if someone else is running the business, they haven't been given a cut of the profits.
All the while there is helpful large lettering on the control centre monitors, telling you which missile-launching satellite is slowly going through its motions.
The weakest movie on this topic I have seen for quite a while.
The main character, a private investigator, somehow is allowed to accompany police officers on a night-time raid of a dark farmhouse that reeks of death... then assumes the role of hostage negotiator while there is a half dozen armed police officers standing right behind him.
The actor that portrays the investigator is quite amateurish while the lead that plays the female part is awful { take not of the beginning when she is in the detectives office and they are talking.
When the femme non fetale first arrives at the PI's office it's this dreadful side shot which just sits there for about five minutes while the two of them fail to act in each others general direction from the opposite sides of the screen.
It goes on like that for an hour and forty tedious minutes with a couple of goofy and gooey effects don't liven up the proceedings one bit, until it ends with Chris Sarandon hamming it up for all he's worth while I considered hanging myself from the tedium of it all.
Coming to the IMDb site to review this commercially successful movie, I was amazed at the Oscar recognition it garnered in 1978 for what is, to my eyes and ears a very unremarkable re-make of the enjoyable 1941 Claude Rains feature "Here Comes Mr Jordan", while surreptitiously grafting on the title of another "life after death" 40's classic starring Don Ameche.
The cinematography is merely average, soft focusing around Beatty & Christie's love scenes while the acting gig for all must have been the easiest payday they ever earned.
Lazy screenplay shorthand for bossy woman: talking on cell phone about china patterns while walking through airport.
The best point, to place it, after all, above the 'awfull' grade: It's funny, thanks for some sincere giggles and roar of laughters while the whole evolves - in short, a classic in the "worst of" category... (In this mood, don't' miss it!)
I am no fan of Salman Khan and while I am still willing to give Ash a chance, this film is the sort of junk that gave her a bad reputation in the first place.
The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile.
Who voted this as a "10", children under 12 who snuck the DVD from their parents and watched it late at night while all were asleep???
This is a rip off of Bruce Almighty which is ten times more funnier; Salman Khan cannot act he is always screaming and making stupid faces while Priyanka Chopra is just as bad as Salman...Amitabh Bachan is okay taking over Morgan Freeman's role but the film is a complete copy of Bruce Almighthy and is very very bad....
All the while I was watching this movie I kept asking myself, Do the authors of this mediocrity understand what being catholic is all about?
Vince Vaughn's character, Gary, in particular, was horribly annoying whenever Aniston's character, Brooke, was around, and, while Brooke was at least likable, many of her actions seemed mean and reprehensible.
Her previous films did not make money for the production companies to actually allow her to continue making films as a 'star' and I believe based solely on her performances on Friends was she cast in other films, all the while the producers would dump cash into her films hoping she would hit that one big starring lead to allow them to justify another J A starrer.
And while we're at it, I am really sick of the marketing geniuses advertising movies in such a way that you have no idea what you're walking into.
She tells him (while crying) that all she ever wanted from him was a little appreciation.
They both go their separate ways: he continues his tour guide business, and she travels for a while.
The main girl is cast at least 10 years too old, while that Mars chap appears to be suffering a mild concussion.
The man who plays the pirate captain Blueberry is overwhelmingly terrible, while Nicolas Donaldson does a fair job of wearing a green t-shirt for the duration of the entire series while displaying the acting ability of a coconut tree (many of which feature in the show, and are considerably more impressive).
2 of the girls are lesbians, while another is bi-sexual.
2 of the bandmates were sexually abused when young, then one of them is raped, another dies in an accident, while the remaining one is a drug addict.
A man is held at gunpoint while his girlfriend is molested.
A string of shallow and unpleasant male characters strut about, spraying the testosterone, while all the women are pale and cowering mice, their only role to be threatened, humiliated and attacked by the men.
Frank Whaley always looked strained trying to get his part right, while Ethan appeared relaxed and natural.
Just watching the 'african-american boy from hard times trying to make it in the white man's world while being pressured to become a hoodlum" or the "he's a deadly sniper who'll kill you in a second but he's got a family and a split personality that includes a heart of gold" was enough to make me want to vomit and laugh at the same time, sort of a yuk-yak (back of Kojak, this one's mine too).
And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying.
", not "Okay, you can stay a while and why aren't I stuttering?"
Shyamalan is multitasking here, attempting to transport his audience through the magical realism of his self-proclaimed "bedtime story" while simultaneously denouncing his critics for trashing the gospel of M. Night.
Probably the creepiest aspect of all this was that Bruce's son, Brandon, also died prematurely while filming THE CROW and the studio did pretty much the same trick (though with modern computer techniques it did look better).
First, while I greatly enjoyed watching Chuck Norris BRIEFLY at the beginning of the film, somebody should have told him to shave his back hair!!!
I rate this movie a 2 out of 10, two points for having a cool ending credits where they show clips of the real Bruce Lee while a sad tune plays in the background.
The archived footage of Bruce Lee just seems forced and thrown in to try and make a buck while the actual footage of Lee's funeral just feels tasteless and inconsiderate.
I have been going crazy for the past 5 years while trying to find this older show and I just found it.
There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits.
You can just feel precious seconds of your life slipping away while waiting for them to complete their discussions.
In "AVALANCHE", Rock Hudson is David Shelby - a well-meaning but extremely foolish ski-resort owner who has ignored all warnings from environmentalists in building a new ski-resort while removing all the trees in the process which spells the perfect recipe for disaster.
In reality, there is nothing the slightest bit amusing about an avalanche, but while watching this movie, you can't for a second take it seriously.
Another hilarious scene would involve a 'gas' explosion inside the resort that is nothing more than a 'puff of smoke' that sends one chef flying backwards into some shelves and an unlucky female that goes sliding along a counter while knocking off bowls of food onto the floor.
Actually, some of the performances are pretty good-- Dawson and Loring are believable toughies, while Carlson and her swain come across as genuinely nice kids.
There were some scenes I found I was watching while holding my breath, not wishing to disrupt the heart-and-soul being displayed onscreen.
Things get worse, and Will and Kelly try to save Colleen, while Lutz and Garner continue to investigate.
All the while, she reads through the pages of a book Liam has written.
It has been done in dozens of other movies, Jerry Lewis Geary gets into the refrigerator while the oxygen tanks in his house blow up all the roaches.
Only the last 10 (or 5) minutes show a little action when the main character (a peeping Tom who only lives to take photos of other people) kills some bugs with an explosion in his kitchen while he hides in the fridge.
It was actually rather sad, on the filmer's account, to focus on the breasts of Rosy to create some kind of, whatever, image: an American teenage girl, smoking dope once in a while, looking good and showing off her bra.
And a guy under the bed while his mom gets it on is just gross.
Susan Sarandon plays Scott's airhead boiler mother, sleepwalking through the role while Tim Robbins wasn't looking.
There's one gag involving a video camera accidentally being left running while Ethan Suplee's character gabs on and on about how hot Scott's mother is.
He throws him to the ground repeatedly while teaching wrestling moves; and even forces him to undress and do pull-ups in front of the other students.
Also, everyone in the berg seems to love the old guy, while Farley's significant other, Tracy (Melissa Sagemiller, "The Guardian") admits to having a crush on him.
That is the question you'll be asking while watching this.
In the opening minutes two scenes are spliced together - Campbell and her boyfriend on separate conversations, Campbell while walking down the street.
Cagney is "on the toboggan" (say the headlines) while Linden makes a cake-baking wifey, er, a respectable woman of Blondell.
The sex scenes, which I admit I was looking forward to, were nothing but people rubbing against each other or rubbing against couches and moaning for unclear reasons, while Beethoven and Bach blared in the background.
We witness pointless double-crosses and mindless plot twists while perverting the novel.
Sarah makes a grave mistake in taking the train back to Paris and holding the precious coin in her hand while she falls asleep!
The rest on the script is filled with many other unbelievable occurrences, all while expecting the viewer to take it seriously!
Well, it's been a while since the 1995 release of Wally White's ode to self-absorption "Lie Down with Dogs," and the film still ranks as the worst gay movie devoted to celluloid, and an atrocity on all levels.
To make matters worse, he actually points out several of these hapless losers out while pontificating from on high in a crowded dance club.
The storyline follows the fundamentally aimless and anti-social activities of Steve Carson (a ferret-like Rod Zuanic), who occupies his time by selling drugs, stealing, lying, cheating, etc., for no particular reason, while providing very little of entertainment value for viewers, and even less for the high school teachers and administrators who must have dealings with him.
"Haunted Forest" failed as far as originality and the general storyline was completely ubiquitous and inconsequential, but while actually keeping me JUST interested enough with it's very unusual look.
When Flipp and Kiyomi vanish, their friends meet each other and stay together while a deranged hunter chases new victims for the vengeful spirit of the tree.
This guy made another dutch classic called 'Philene is sorry' with the same actress , Kim van Kooten ' and that film was maybe worse , but this one comes in close.I Cannot believe that his films are being taken seriously.it is supposed to be a film about a guy filming his sister in video format while he is constantly talking frustrated text into the mic.commenting on his sisters behaviour before the lens.
is not true i actually enjoyed several episodes thru the years , among them the rescue scene where Dr Ross saves the boy, Dr Greene last episode,and this years the recurring dream,and yes i am a big fan of Dr. morris, ,but the thing i hate this show is it wears thin , one of my least favorite character is Dr carter , he is a rich ,preppy type doctor who had so little in common with the people this show is usually about , .i also hate the fact the writers etc preach to us in every show they said on the recap they never did well they are wrong watch the old shows and see if they are not pushing an agenda ,it always came with a point if you really looked closely, while some like that i don't like Hollywood telling me what to think.what to feel!!
This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while.
For instance, the opening scene has a young girl (about 13) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her!
- Couple find "professor" who is captured by Nazis, and professor dies while couple miraculously escapes the Nazis twice.
From the cheesey rock music sound track at the opening credits you realize they are not going to give the genre any respect..and great movies like Army of Darkness..can make fun of the genre while still respecting it.
I almost had to break my own rule while watching this atrocity.
Too bad he couldn't track down a decent story while he was at it.
Instead we're forced to watch while he charms the ladies, smokes cigars, and holds his shiny gun.
The job doesn't work out, but the faces she makes while trying to finish a call are definitely funny.
Having said all that, while I found Ms. Bara's vamping pretty entertaining near the end, the first 30 minutes of A Fool There Was almost put me to sleep since that time mainly concerned the man she was fooling with's family.
As for Zachary Scott, while he's far from a household name, I loved how slimy he could be--and when I read he was playing a guy who's selling guns to get rich during the Mexican Civil War of the 1910s, it sounded like a role PERFECTLY suited for him.
By the way, while Miss Thiess is NOT a household name and only made a few American films, this German actress caught Robert Taylor's eye and they married--and remained married until his death in the late 1960s.
But what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:  - the death of Poppaea and St Paul's talk with Nero at her dead body,   - Claudius' mention of the current conquest of Britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife much before his death),   - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother,   - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators,   - finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by Acte "Let us forgive him"  All in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the Roman Empire.
After a while, Nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her.
Nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake.
The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous.
Twenty five years ago, the young son of my theater directing professor, Mr. Valeriu Moisescu, while watching at the TV an extremely boring and tasteless comedy, remarked: "Daddy, this movie is sorta stationery" (in Romanian: "stÃ¤tÃ¤tor", as he said).
In fact, it put them to bed (they're asleep at 8:10 while I am babysitting with them at my place) - I guess that's "one" GOOD thing that came from this movie; it'll knock the kids out fast.
A reformed prostitute (Diana Sands) attempts to bring a fairly inept pimp down while the cops are on him like glue.
If he is willing to not tell the whole story in this account while claiming it is based on actual events, then I can not trust him to tell the truth in his documentaries.
We're introduced to a young Iraqi insurgent who by day runs a video store that sells DVDs to US soldiers while leading a double life where together with his uncle (a disgruntled former Iraqi soldier) he smuggles weapons and plants roadside bombs.
This film tries to portray the exceptions as the rule while ignoring the fact that insurgents routinely and as a matter of policy target civilians in market places and funeral processions.
The Americans then take it upon themselves to kill four innocent by-standers who are in the wrong place at the wrong time while the two cooperatives responsible easily get away between two houses, shooting behind their backs as they run.
They are barbarians while American Soldiers are some of the most honorable people in the world.
And while there is often peer pressure or doctrinal conditioning, and even sometimes situational factors that prevents Marines from seeking immediate mental help, none would ever be outright denied that help, let alone told that he could not receive it in theater.
I could swear a whole 20-30 minutes of the film went by showing actors from behind while they talked and from across the street while they walked or sitting in low lighting close up but so that you could not see the expressions on their faces nor their eyes.
If you like GOOD movies that are stimulating and profound just from listening to conversation while enjoying good actors, check out RICHARD LINKLATER's "Before Sunset" -- or make a double feature of it and watch "Before Sunrise" first.
Apparently no one (including Lewis) was actually paying attention while the camera was rolling.
It's fun brainless carnage packed with oddities and quirks used by directors whom while trying to score a buck or two also test the censorship boundaries to their limit and sometimes succeed in making something that really stands out.
The family "miraculously" escape death time and time again while the bad guy descends into madness, yadda, yadda.
Like the English pronunciation-mangling Japanese hooker in the hotel room and the pointless, unromantic conversations with Bill & Scarlett characters who somehow fall in love while possessing ice-cold personalities that would make Mr.
Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murrey, while accomplished movie actors in their right, do the barest minimum except mug to the camera in the aura of exulting "Sundance Film Festival" self-importance that elevate this movie to the new level (more like bottom 100) in high art, with moronically sedate monotony & meandering tedium thrown in.
In the end, when it comes to slasher flicks, while Scream proved imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Camp Slaughter shows that imitation isn't far from ridicule, and this movie can only be summed up with that one word: ridiculous.
The acting could have been improved if the actors felt the moment, i felt like screaming it after a while!
There is the fat one, the athletic one, the rebel, the nerdy girl and all of them do exactly what you expect them to while being stalked by an escaped bunny man.
Paul Bettaney looks quite like the younger MacDowell (whose younger self he plays), and the film also has the talented David Thewlis on its cast list, but the net result is tiresome and thin, while the potentially interesting plot ends without subtlety or satisfaction.
When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.
the first one was bad enough , why didnt they quit while they were ahead??
If you have ever wondered what the protagonists in a wrestling match say to each other while they are otherwise locked into their imposing holds, watch this movie.
The movie is NOT SCARY, while being trapped by devious dogs from hell they manage to have a good time drinking and stuff.
Like ones who influence the world because they RUN IT- and not watch it on CNN while eating chips and thinking up conspiracy theories?
Just making Moore look like an inconsiderate assh*** & then letting those who represent the completely opposing views have their say, while throwing all the trash they can on Moore's work, causes me to suspect whether these film makers were ever truly fans of Moore.
I use the word "fan" loosely here really because while I've enjoyed his documentaries and come away from them believing I'd learned something, I've also had problems with them.
A typical example of this is juxtaposing footage of Moore arriving at the Oscars, while nearby protesters demonstrate against the war.
There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening.
But despite this he is human, and while some reviewers have been critical of the ending, I found it to be credible and almost Shakesperean in its intent.
It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes.
She's in cahoots with the bad guys and shamelessly flirts with McNally and young gun Eugene Iglesias while all the time she acts as Mohr's moll in a more modern gangster film style.
When watching Fellini films I am infected with a violent desire to throw popcorn at the screen and quote Bruno Kirby from _When Harry Met Sally_ in the scene where he's frustrated at Sally's inability to convey her ideas while playing a game of Pictionary: "Draw SOMETHING resembling ANYTHING!!!"
In the last ten minutes they are pulled over by desert-driving thugs, who force them to stop, rape and brutalize the man, while forcing the woman to watch.
He hits a dog while driving the Hummer because she's blocking his window.
The movie drags along for quite a while and when the climax comes we are totally unprepared for it.
Long waits while indifferent freight cars rumble slowly through the crossing, sometimes stopping completely?
'Shadows', however, while firmly within the Expressionist genre, is too arty for its own good.
All of my negative judgement was concentrated on her, and, while I wasn't strictly allowed to sympathize with her husband, I tended to, anyway.
You also get the impression it was written while the film was rolling; it's too fragmented and there isn't any character to identify with.
And there's a terribly stupid scene with protagonist's gun jamming while enemy is at gunpoint.
Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.
This is appropriate, because while I would call "Lock" primarily a comedy, this was most definitely not.
The one moment some of its sound effects are too loud while the other things and dialog are too soft.
This is also variating and at times you can't even hear some of the characters, while the others are clearly understandable, even when they are in the same scene's at times.
I have to say I'm pretty impressed with Legion of the Dead considering the supposed $500,000 budget, it looks alright & while the special effects aren't going to win any awards they're not too bad.
From classics to genre oddities to mainstream pap, he's had a career that touches many points.... while the productions he's in might not all be winners, at least he can be counted-on for an entertaining (and often unique) performance.
While Selena plans to use the sphere's powers to rule the world; Kara steals an experimental spaceship and on Earth, becoming Supergirl: the girl of steal; now the long-blond-tressed Kara enrolls in a girl-school as a brunette using the name Linda Lee, while searching for the Omegahedron in her spare time wearing the familiar costume of her cousin Superman.
MacGuigan goes one further than Soderbergh - both directors emphasis role-playing, casting iconic 60s stars who seem to be making it up as they go along, having a laugh, trying on accents and clothes, but while Terence Stamp achieves some kind of grace, Malcolm MacDowall goes very uncoolly mad.
MacDowell is never known by a name (his character is played by two actors, the others by one), and becomes a mere cipher, though with very real, frightening power, while Frankie remains essentially himself, his image a mere show of strength, never his whole self.
And while Audrey Tautou is just totally cute and lovable and AmÃ©lie Poulain is a multi-faceted, well constructed character, Caterine Frot - sadly - has no comedic talent whatsoever and her character Odette Toulemonde is dull, uninteresting and flat.
The film does have bits of originality, such as the "torture" while we see the FPV of the victim, fades in and out in his dying minutes, as the killer stands over his body, continuing the slaughter.
Years go by and Freddie finally is released, while McDowell eagerly awaits his return, he expect some conflict, but what he get is a let down, I won't ruin what happens, but you'd expect something explosive.
Together, Bond and Bouvier prowl the back streets of Mexico City, doing battle with Sanchez's psychotic henchman, Dario (a very young, Benicio Del Toro) while Bond attempts to bleed Sanchez maul, Lupe Lamore (Talisa Soto) for information.
Nor is there anything memorable about the brief moments of action that round out an otherwise boring movie in which the bulk of the plot concentrates on Sanchez Â sneering and plotting while other men with guns shoot it out with Bond and Bouvier.
I suppose you could also see inspector Jansen as a parody, which might make it a bit more bearable, but the storyline is still too thin to make it worth while.
I thought the movie played too hard to the ten-year-old 'cussy-boy' crowd, who seemed after wards to be a bit embarrassed by it all, as were many of the parents whose eye I caught exiting the theater while the end credits rolled.
The filmmakers could have gone for the PG-13 while they were at it, for the Fox "Malcom in the Middle" crowd.
Many of the others have a certain brainless remedial value to watch while you do the dishes, chat on the internet or sort through your mail.
hasselhoff dosen't know if he's coming or going, and will approve just about anyone, brandy usually does a halfway decent job, and piers, while being the "token" sharp tongued, tell it like it is brit, is totally unappreciated in his time.. he might be a little abrasive, but that's his character, and he seems to be the only one that makes sense.
the producers obviously included acts that are extremely un-talented, for shock value and ratings, and while some of them may very well be genuinely talented, there are acts that are better than them, and they can't seem to take someone telling them how it is.. if thats the case they should have stayed at home.
"These bad boys with the black nipples are the Death Heads," the cut-price Castaneda points out, while the audience wonders just what the heck kind of accent that is.
Bluto the jock gets slaughtered while out 'dogging', shortly after conversing with a talking cow; the rest follow suit.
Shrooms also has to make do with the self-same camera tricks to replicate the audio-visual apparitions, and to similarly lackluster effect, while its monotonous over-reliance on sudden, deafening chords pastes over the lack of genuine shocks.
Numerous scenes in this dragged on effortlessly while the end was a complete ripoff of "Identity" and "High Tension".
So what we have is some young people, who start out alright, but become more repugnant as the film goes, running around a swamp, screaming, swearing, getting more and more muddy, while bodies and leering faces jump out at them in entirely predictable ways, while the camera zooms around in that style that has become quite trendy in recent years.
I could have used this while watching Shrooms.
From the opening shot with some unknown woman writing in her journal about a mysterious man who ruined the planet or somesuch, into the overly pretentious 11 minute opening credits....... OK, I digress.. but seriously, who cares about the radio stations still working and the 2 fat guys who drive around for a while mumbling.
Wwhile I'm on the subject of music...it was there when it shouldn't have been and STOPPED the moment it needed to be there.. music while talking and none during 'action'.
James Mason, too young for his role and heavily made-up, keeps shouting as if everyone else had gone deaf, while the supporting players are equally colorless.
The romance was definitely very cute and enjoyable, while not being sickening.
All in all, while it should remain as a made-for-TV movie, it's definitely a fun one to watch--a great date movie, if anything else.
Well, it turns out Bibb too had only her looks (which I did not find appealing) to fall upon, while (the extremely cute) Mello mysteriously vanished and only Gorham made a career for himself.
During or after "Popular", she's been in twenty projects, including hit movies like Pearl Harbor, The Ring and a regular cast-member status in two series, while also guest starring in others.
Bottom line: this is something that you can safely watch while doing something else, since should you miss something, the chances are, you've seen it in some other similar movie and therefore know what you missed.
A boat rows from the front of the screen away from the audience to the back, while to the right, women wait on the port.
A series of murders at a creepy mansion are connected to the secret of a door which has seven keys to it and nobody has opened for a while.
A lot of the movie's humor is generated by the fact that Ted and Alice, while young and trying to be "with it", are really, at heart, a little uptight.
Thus, the concluding scenes of the four deciding that their friendship made it impossible to begin a sexual relationship and the eye contact they make with strangers while on their way to the Tony Bennett concert, while all the way the closing song ("What The World Needs Now Is Love") plays in the background.
Anyone who looks at these two movies side-by-side will surely agree that "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice", while moderately amusing when it was current, has no lasting value.
But while in a hotel room in Las Vegas, after they've all revealed some secrets, they decide to have an orgy.
It manages to come across with a sort of anti-promiscuity message, while tittilating the (male) viewer with lots of footage of natalie wood prancing around in her underwear.
Robert Culp's Bob and Natalie Wood's Carol balance quite nicely; Mr. Culp is square-jawed sexy with a slight deadpan delivery while Miss Wood was at the height of her looks and popularity.
He has to hideout at his girl's house for a while while she tries to hide her profession from him.
Hung and Ann(Pauline Chan and Rena Murakami)are down-on-their luck prostitutes trapped in Hong Kong.Pauline's boyfriend,Sam back in China,who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory,is double-crossed by Billy Chow,and while looking to escape;flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the brothel where Pauline is employed.He is crushed when he finds out the truth..."Escape from the Brothel" combines plenty of gory fighting,romance,sleaze including several violent and unpleasant rape scenes and comedy,all into one.There is plenty of full-frontal female nudity and I'm not complaining about that.The violence is rather brief until the full-blooded finale,although one scene where a woman is strung up and has her nipples wired to a portable electric generator is strong stuff even for Cat III sleaze.A must-see for die-hard fans of smut!
I defy you to sit complacently while Elena approaches Victor's barrio apartment.
But there isn't too much substance beneath the surface: all the leading figures are gorgeous without being lovable, and while the central sex scene is certainly quite erotic, I don't imagine you'd see anything quite so arousing by sticking a camera in any real couple's bedroom.
He can cry while he talks and convince you that he is suffering.
Francesca Neri didn't seem Spanish while I was watching the film.
Worry not though, her friend who helps her dress for the loowow and listens while Gidget worries about men but says nothing, is pinned, to a guy of course.
I mean, I'm sure Gidget and Moondoggie could surf a few feet from each other all the while giving meaningful glances at each other.
And while Arthur O'Connell does a good job as her father, I've never been able to picture him as anything other than a determined bachelor after his role in Picnic.
It seems that while I was growing up, my best friend and I could not have a sleepover or a slumber party without watching "Gidget" and "Grease".
Amar, Akbar, Anthony is about 3 brothers who are left by their Mum with their Dad and they all get separated while they are children.
Kishenlal then takes his sons with him while being chased by Robert's henchmen.
The second son, Anthony (Amitabh Bachchan) is adopted by a Christian priest and becomes a hoodlum on the streets, while the youngest, Akbar (Rishi Kapoor) is adopted by a Muslim tailor and becomes a Qawwali singer.
(Kishore Kumar sang for Amitabh Bachchan, while Mohammed Rafi sang for Rishi Kapoor.)
Gig Young registers okay as the hero, while Chill Wills is saddled with the "spirit".
And while they do so, both are unaware of the explosions about to rend apart the worlds of Arnold, Windsor, and Talman - and dragging in Young's younger brother.
Just saw this film a couple of hours ago and thought I'd write a review while it was still fresh in my Mind.
A grab-bag of second-hand ideas from Two-Way Stretch, The Tall Guy and others, it's a laugh-free zone that goes out of its way to avoid surprises while failing to ever find its own tone, nodding to half-baked attempts realism and wildly underdeveloped comedy without ever committing to either.
Even the tried-and-trusted routines don't work here: Bill Nighy is just irritating as he tries to splutter some life into unfunny dialogue while Timothy Spall does his dishevelled hamster shtick yet again, while the amateur musical used as a backdrop for the planned prison break seems simply amateurish and unfunny.
However, it does shed light on the difficulty of maintaining a relationship while still enjoying the university lifestyle.
I was lucky enough to screen this movie a while back.
We get it, she's a virgin and needs to ponder if she's ready, while thinking back to the moments she felt secure with him...
Yet, this great TV series was doomed and forgotten due to bad timing, while elementary level suspense and fantasy like "Heroes" and "Lost" got many seasons and followers... How incomprehensible and depressing, really, "GOD IS NOWHERE", or shall I quote Paul Callan "...why is God doing this?"
The five Z warriors get the living daylights beaten out of them while Brolly isn't even scratched!
Goku is completely annoying and stupid while Vageta (Who's my all time favorite DBZ character) just stands around moping because he can't defeat Brolly.
It has a simple storyline (boy loves girl, while humanity's future is threatened by warmongering cyborgs - hey, it's anime) but an innocence at heart which very few movies, even animated ones, are able to match.
You have to feel sorry for Ron K. James, Varney's co-star in this mess, who has little to do but spout dreadful dialogue and look uncomfortable while Varney's gurning face hogs all the close-ups.
In the short  while, watch "Laugh In" reruns and prep yourself for a look back  into comedy history.  
Olsen & Johnson go to Universal Studios to film their successor to Hellzapoppin', while everyone at the studio runs for cover.
Brooks played it pretty much as a straight film, while Olsen and Johnson used it as an excuse to do silly things with famous people.
In the short  while, watch "Laugh In" reruns and prep yourself for a look back  into comedy history.  
Perhaps in service only a short while.
It moves along at a nice pace, it has some nice twists & turns while it's one of those films which really comes together during the final 10 minutes when the truth is finally revealed, it may not come as the biggest shock in the cinematic world but it's effective, satisfying, you'll be thinking about it whether you liked it or not & it ties up everything that has gone before really well.
He keeps the pace going while maintaining the mystery elements of the plot so as to keep you guessing, for such a simple idea it all works rather well in my opinion.
I think that was the while point.
Not anything like the Paladin of the games (it took a while to get used to a non-scottish Paladin), but a very good, dark, but fatherly figure.
He was attracted, while at university, to the shy Agnes, but when warned off by her family's boarder one evening, he hurriedly left her home.
He also finds out that for him, the best way is to put hand over hand along the rope that leads upwards while kicking the ones who are coming below him.
He with held from my torment for a while, until I showed him where the Godzilla movies were.
Norma flees, and Cliff is left standing alone and dejected in his office workshop, while in the foreground we see "Rex the Walkie-Talkie Robot Man" walking to the end of the table and falling off the end.
Clifford runs into an old flame, who is back in town and begins to innocently spend some time with her while she's in town.
Here we have something of a certain class that's quite a good yarn while being far deeper than most US films.
Not surprisingly, while Kruger is interrogating the Rif prisoner that Sergeant Kincaid provided him, Kincaid is making time with DeLatour.
Mike Kincaid, a French Foreign Legionnaire, who, while in a military stockade, learns of an impending attack on the city proper while the main garrison is away.
However, shot in lovely Technicolor and moving at a rapid pace, the film is an enjoyable ride through familiar territory; what was somewhat surprising, plot-wise, is that while much was made initially of the unloved Lieutenant (Stephen Bekassy) and his blonde girlfriend (Mari Blanchard), their characters virtually disappear once Lancaster's jailbird unit sets out on its mission!
The Hole is very cleverly written and it keeps you guessing-about both how the characters came to be trapped and what happen to them while they were.
There was no real plot to the story for a while, just a gentle, philosophical taxi driver named Phil (Timothy Spall) who has a dry love relationship with his partner (who works in a supermarket) Penny (Lesley Manville), their daughter Rachel (Alison Garland) is an elderly people's home cleaner, and their son son Rory (James Corden) is unemployed and aggressive.
I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie, but I had seen Secrets and Lies a while ago and really liked it.
Its nice to see the teen thriller/horror genre being experimented with by the Brits for once.This is being touted as the Brit Blair Witch, and while its certainly not that, its an incredibly enjoyable night out.
The film was unfocused for quite a while, I personally think the teenager love stories can be cut at least by half.
In the beginning, while watching this film, I was alternately disgusted and infuriated.
The Father, Phil Bassett (Timothy Spall) works as a Taxi driver while his wife Penny (Lesley Manville) is a checkout operator at a local supermarket.
The script is authentic, witty and full of emotion while not being repetitive (barring the word "alright"!).
Still it brings up happy memories when I see an episode once in a while.
Ironically, while in 2002, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMAN finally cast an Indian as Nemo, but changed his motivation to a "pirate," here he returns to the James Mason-Herbert Lom European style of casting, but retaining his actual beliefs, if not his ethnicity.
Like the 1961 version, Nemo warns the castaways of the volcanic eruption, who escape in a small boat, while he remains behind to gather his notes, but is trapped in the grotto as the Nautilus is crushed in the rocks and lava.
Patrick Stewart valiantly tries, but sadly looking an Arabian Dress Up Party as the sinister Captain Nemo, Kyle MacLachlan does his usual Twin Peaks wooden routine, while the Pirate Captain gives a terrible impersonation of Robert Newton's Long John Silver.
He was so amazingly bad (eclipsed only by the obviously artificial wig, that looks like it was last worn by a member of Motley Crue) that we couldn't contain our laughter while he was on screen.
Now superimpose cheesy giant CGI critters that look like they were thrown together in an afternoon of programming while playing the original "DOOM!"
And while I have great respect for Patrick Stewart and his talent this movie even makes him look bad.
They might hurt themselves while they are kicking the TV.
I've never seen a really bad performance from Patrick Stewart until tonight, and while it's possible he was doing what was asked of him - the result is something between a train wreck and paint drying.
It turns out that the alien craft was on a salvage hunt for abductees, and while Mulder and Scully visit Theresa Hoese (nee Nemman, her of the nosebleed), one of the local UFO geeks is sucked into the ship's shields.
All the while Krycek pokes his nose around looking for the craft (the sum of which is sitting in his car on the phone).
Marita and CSM share some pretty insightful conversations, and it's credit to Laurie Holden that you can see her hatred for him burning while she maintains a veneer of cold, emotionless efficiency.
This time he succeeds, and while Scully discovers that the alien DNA means Mulder is at risk, Mulder and Skinner travel to the site and the inevitable happens.
The guest stars are varied and fascinating, allowing each episode to have a fresh and intriguing spin, while the long term story arcs keep the viewer coming back week after week.
The "other" "Overboard" with Goldie Hawn and Curt Russell, while a cute comedy that takes place on the ocean, has nothing in common with this older or original "Overboard," which is certainly far from being comical.
I've been anticipating this film for a while since it is Thora Birch's first role since American Beauty.
Hannah already knows being a has-been, and while her appearance in films I will not glorify by mentioning here gave her a bit of a kick-start, she seems anxious to go back.
Richards' career has utterly tanked, and after seeing The Third Wheel, I cannot keep a straight face while calling this unjust.
It's filled with interviews that just becomes too much of the same after a while.
And while many viewers find the mÃ©lange of effects (real time interviews with fictional superimposed storyline) too edgy to digest, for this viewer LidÃ³n succeeds in informing her audience about the motivations and insights from honest prostitutes, gigolos, and their pimps with a gracious style.
Acting and special effects are as to be expected of a low budget production, but while those can be forgiven, the lack of any originality can't.
2005 was a great year for horror movies and while this one would not be as good as Skeleton Key and story not as good as Death Tunnel, it sure starts 2006 on a good note.
**** Spoilers below ************  It has the the supernatural going on all around while no one can see it.
It made me laugh while keeping me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
DAY OF THE BEAST is a film that I've had in my possession for quite a while but just never got around to.
Amazingly, the director manages to keep the laughs coming throughout, while at the same time ensuring that the apocalyptic tones aren't lost to the comedy side of the film.
Lorre plays a fallen gentleman who fallen into a bottle and thus into some dicey company, while Greenstreet plays a solicitor who's been a tad too speculative with his trust accounts.
Some one told me a while back that I should check this movie out.
PoirÃ© knew what he was doing, and while this is definitely no Amelie, it does show the colorful cinematic technique that the French have so proudly called their own.
Eleanor's battle with finding her place in the world while in the shadow of her ego maniacal boyfriend is a story as old as time.
It is satisfying in the end to see how Eleanor, by just being who she is, basically fumbles into her true calling while trying to navigate a world so cutthroat and critical.
She feels sheÂ´s just a "normal" girl who wouldnÂ´t mind having a kid, while living among all sorts of arty big city characters.
With all the souls in Hell this show could go on for a while and we never know what will escape next.
Bret Harrison is doing a great job of holding this show on his shoulders while Tyler Labine and Rick Gonzalez deliver an amazing comedic backup duo.
I still do the costume of horny the clown is the best iv seen in a while the music was great.
he must lie, make up lame excuses and keep secrets from her), it actually gets moving after a while.
First of all, Clark and Carole initially met filming "No Man Of Her Own" when Gable was loaned to Paramount in late 1932, while Lombard was married to William Powell; they got along well on the set, but no sparks flew and from all accounts they didn't keep in touch.
The poorly written script should have been based upon the novel by Warren G. Harris rather than fantasy while the casting offices should have looked for actors better suited for the parts.
The real Lombard was hardly such and while she used the language that Clayburgh shouted over and over again in the film, in reality it did not come off in the cheap manner that Clayburgh performed it in.
i didn't find this movie too bad.i was expecting something more intense.this is a fairly family friendly ghost story and there's nothing wrong with that.Elisha Cuthbert is the leading female character,while Ricky Mabe(whose career so far has been mostly TV series and a one or two TV movies)is the lead male character.the acting is fine,and the movie has bit of an eerie feel to it.however,i didn't really buy into the reason for the ghost haunting the estate.it just seemed too weak of an explanation to me.other than that,i don't have any major gripe with movie.like i said,it's pretty lite family fare,so you want see any blood or violence,and there's no bad language that i recall.it's rated PG for thematic material,but i don't think too many children over ten would have a problem with it.for me,"Believe" is a 7/10
Harris, Logart, and Jackson spend their time hiding from an investigation by older, White detective Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) and young, Black lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto) while avoiding Black mobster Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and Italian mafioso Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), who are looking to recover their stake.
A demeanor he maintains without a crease while he maims, tortures and kills!
Harris wields a lightweight machine gun and covers the five mobsters while his partner stuffs wads of cash into a suitcase.
Harlem owns the police, yet they are there to uphold the law Â while perhaps not exactly like that in Harlem today Â one can see this happening throughout the world in modern society.
This is a cannon of a film, one that should be watched and retained for the sheer honesty of the work, while it is fiction it holds a bit of truth to the turbulence of the world.
Disguised as cops, three black crooks steal a big amount of cash after killing five syndicate runners and two policemenÂ The New York police and the Mafia react with immediate concernÂ   Tough police veteran Captain Frank Mattelli (Quinn) resents the intrusion of Lieutenant Pope (Kotto), a black detective, in the case, while Mafia boss Don Gennaro (Frank Mascetta) sends his paranoid son-in-law, Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), to reassert control over the Harlem branch and see that the money is recoveredÂ   The black syndicate, headed by Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and his assistant Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), rejects D'Salvio, while promising only token help, and accuses Mattelli, who has been on the take from Johnson for yearsÂ   Anthony Quinn plays well the ageing detective who has long ago perceived that all his efforts are not going to do more than raise the very small part of the cover of crime, but he is not above taking a bribe from a racketeerÂ His method of dealing with a reluctant witness is to hit hard first and ask questions laterÂThe rigorously legal approach to police work, as exemplified by Yaphet Kotto, is not for QuinnÂ This is his territory, his little kingdom, and he keeps the peace as best he knowsÂ
These would be considered separate from musicals in that it exists to create imagery for the music, while musicals use the music to create drama or spectacle for imagery.
'Couers' (which I believe, from my limited knowledge of French, means 'hearts') is a little dull compared to the English title of 'Private Fears in Public Places' which, while perhaps not perfectly relevant to the film, is still an excellent title all the same.
), while maintaining the essence of the tale (abetted by the narration of Sir Michael Redgrave) Â is to have Alastair Sim and Michael Hordern reprise their roles of Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley respectively from the definitive screen adaptation of 20 years previously!!
And, herein, lies perhaps this film's ultimate dilemma: while certainly not a perfunctory or redundant effort, one is not likely to forsake the earlier cinematic rendition because of itÂ
It rails against "The Big Lie" while at the same moment spouting some of the most incredible whoppers I have ever heard!
But the argument about safety and buying time to rearm, while plausible to an extent, does not explain the Soviet Union's willingness to grab the eastern portion of neighboring Poland while Germany grabbed the Western portion, nor using this to eventually attack the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthonia, and Finland.
'I Love to Singa', while too sweet for some viewers, is a true classic in my eyes and I adore it more ever time I see it.
He's croonin' a hot little number while doing a haughty Vaudeville strut!
In one film clip of them that I saw there was an actual moment of fun - one of them is doing an energetic dance step while the other two are waiting for him to conclude (it is a nightclub act).
This regretfully results in a total lack of tension and credibility while it COULD have been a compelling thriller story.
The Ritz Brothers get to do their thing in making total jerks of themselves and making you wonder if Uncle Stevens, who was crazy enough to hire them, was in fact in on his own kidnapping in order to get away Scot-free with all the money he stole while everyone else, including the local police and SEC, was sent on a wild goose chase.
They were pretty much interchangeable, with Jimmy and Al mugging while Harry got most of the dialog.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
And while we're praising, there was a half decent effort to convincingly portray a disturbed individual slipping into insanity.
He has to care for his son while his wife goes to work in another city as a babysitter so they can get a house.
The former is searching for the father he's never known, while the latter is only beginning to learn what it means to be a father to his own son.
I normally wouldn't bother writing a review for a made for TV movie, but I got stuck watching while at home for Christmas.
According to the movie, Lucille was vain, insecure, temperamental and at times hysterical while Desi is portrayed as being a shallow, cheating philanderer who is totally dependent on Lucille for financial support.
Unfortunately having established these bikers are ruthless violent criminals the screenwriters inject a piece of violent action which is totally unnecessary and which draws attention to their actions iun the context of the movie  If truth be told these bikers could have been amongst the best screen villains of the 1990s but the cast are let down by the screenplay , it's both very contrived while failing to explain some things .
Reggie is released from prison & a hit is made on him but he survives while Cherry Ganz decides to kill Jack to avenge his brother's death but a bullet proof vest saves him, Reggie & Jack have no choice but to work together to unmask the Iceman & stay alive long enough to do it...
On the down side it's nothing particularly new or original & while it's not a complete rehash of the original it can feel pretty similar at times & there's just so many buddy buddy cop flicks out there Another 48 Hrs.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
while that happens there is an attempt on Jack's Life.
After a while they get to be good buddies during the movie again.
There were constant spats on the set with the biggest complaint that Murphy would arrive three hours late for filming while everyone would have to set around and wait for him to show up.
So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong.
This is a worth while film to view from 1944.
Though while the story isn't all that brilliant, Hedy's infinite loveliness and a few lightly amusing parts make this movie worthwhile.
He supplied most of the humor while she supplied all of the heavenliness.
And while we are on that scene, do police officers at a crash scene really stand around on the roadway chatting while in the adjacent field the injured are dying in one of the cars, with nobody paying them any attention, let alone rendering assistance?
Some say that art imitates life, while others argue that life imitates art.
I have no idea who anyone is in this movie and to tell you the truth after being dragged along for a while I didn't care.
Pitt bought the screen rights to this garbage while he was with Anniston.
Does he do anything special while traveling?
It emits a cinematic glow that hasn't been seen in years while cleverly conveying an educational message;   "Never let go of the one you love, and cherish him/her always."
After a random while, he always goes back to his "present" but is largely unable to affect his future.
The CGI effects of Henry's time traveling are unspectacular but first rate while the overused musical score was melancholic, adding to the tragic tone of the movie.
As the movie opens, we seem him at age 6, happily singing "Jingle Bells" while riding in a car driven by his mother thru a driving rainstorm.
Those people especially are in for a treat, as while the movie does have it's moments of high drama, there is a noticeable lack of darkness, which the book has in spades.
But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.
Once in a while something excellent comes along that adds to one's life in unexpected ways.
This film is a rental, save your $$$ and wait till it comes out on video, that way at least you can drink a beer on your couch while you ponder actors getting paid to act this bad....
Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice.
Cons: Fans of zombie movies may bit disappointed that it takes a while for the walking cadavers to show up and wreak havoc.
but nothing so unforgivable as to take away one's enjoyment while watching this unfold.
By and large, this film benefits almost entirely from Quarry's charismatic presence alone, even if what he has to say to the hippie kids is basic mumbo jumbo(..Quarry admits that he ad-libbed much of this dialogue)often used at that point and time while these youth were stoned or spaced out on acid.
It maintains this finish while keeping its art-house status and evading the glossy overcoat which is becoming more and more popularly associated with the industry in America.
I saw this movie a while back, but just saw it again on Action Channel.
The film is at its best before the group joins the rebel force as the story seems better developed during this stage of the film while the part with them being in the rebel group seems rushed.
The film has an eerie hallucinatory feeling to it, like watching porn in slow motion while on dope.
  I can't help asking these questions while watching most of Franco's movies from the late seventies, early eighties.
In addition, while there is some clever dialog in Too Many Husbands, it is too scant.
Fred MacMurray plays the back from the dead husband, while Melvyn Douglas plays the best friend.
Curiously hesitant to show much depth; still, "The Racket" exposes, while inadvertently glamorizing, the gangster lifestyle.
Whatever the reason, I laughed a lot during this movie, and while I'm ashamed to tell any of my friends that I liked it, I'm telling you.
*SPOILERS* One example is for the beginning where Chingy & Dr.Phil are chained up in the same room, Chingy keeps bumping his head, then keeps "axidentally" hitting Dr.Phil over the head, by knocking down objects while trying to get a rock through a basketball hoop.
From that point on, the narration is somewhat mixed... Verus tells us what he sees and experiences, and whenever he isn't in the scene(and occasionally while he is), the "present day" narrator explains about the gladiators and the time in which this took place... and slays several wide-spread myths about both, in the process.
The drama and the documentary elements aren't separated... while it could have chosen to be either a full-on drama(no doubt evoking more emotions from the audience) or a genuine documentary(most likely being able to include even more information about the time), it chose an interesting path, involving both.
The fights, while they are fairly frequent, could have been just slightly better.
One scene becomes another in rapid succession and it's pretty easy to let the movie charge ahead at its own expense while deciding not to really care yourself.
type of stuff that would be poignant character development in a slow-building drama where characters finally let themselves go over a cup of tea or something, but is absurd to be shouting at each other while being chased down by a 100 year old guy with a face he keeps peeling off and an eye growing out of his forehead.
Yet another DVD I picked up at the local supermarket while searching through the bargain bin.
Then there's the fact that this is a movie from a time long forgotten - a time when smoking cigarettes on screen was accepted and normal, when the PC brigade wasn't around and you could light up whenever and wherever you wanted - these guys go through pack after pack - in the car, in the office (god forbid..), and Boyle even lights up while his colleagues are having lunch right next to him.
The other thing that got me was something you could well call a "running joke" - quite a few times will you see the words "6 Months Later" on the screen - I know that this is probably meant in relation to the real case, and to make things authentic, but the viewer kind of expects these words every time a police building fills the screen while the camera doesn't move - and his expectations won't be disappointed.
But the film provides a sweet exit from lives troubles for a short while.
When Oscar realizes after a while that their relationship has reached the point of no return he tries to break it up.
Untalented American writer living the ultimate petty-bourgeois life in Paris, and who thinks he's Hemingway, falls in love at first sight with a young French woman while riding on a bus.He gives her his ticket and leaves the bus.
All the while, Oscar is all to aware, they are heading for the their peak and once it hits the top, it is only down hill from there.
Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say.
All the while Nigel's wife (Kristin Scott-Thomas) is becoming disillusioned with Nigel's fascination with Mimi and Oscar.
Filmmakers made an engaging, dramatic and compelling film while also staying sensitive to the subjects.
Jill Eikenberry chills as the wife of tycoon Jason Robards, and her composure while some characters expire is right out of Stanwyck/Davis territory.
Bartlow is a happily married man who's home-life has always come first, however Sheilds believes that his wife is interfering with his work, so he engages his dashing leading man 'Goucho' (played by Gilbert Roland) to turn on his Latin charm and seduce the lady away from her husband while the screenplay is finished.
This has tragic results as Goucho and Mrs Bartlow are killed in a plane crash, while running away to Mexico together so she can get a quick divorce and marry her new found Latin lover.
Lana Turner was the other headliner and she delivered the goods as well (while looking wonderful, I might add).
Minnelli's direction is lively while the film's Oscar wins for cinematography, costume design & art direction show that the film is easy on the eyes.
I did this, too, while watching the movie, but in the end it just didn't add up.
But for those out there who find comparing utterly irresistible I would say that 'Beautiful' has better acting and a better script while 'Boulevard' has superior direction and more entertainment value.
I watched it on the telly just this afternoon and it had been a while since I had seen TBATB.
And the scene of her driving the car while completely upset elaborates on this idea.
He sees those around him as little more than 'components' and they recognise the opportunity for great wealth and fame he offers them while they luxuriate in the comfortable fiction that their relationships to him are more than 'just business'.
That one line summary makes me sound like I'm calling the Bad and the Beautiful a case in 'tough love', where director Vincente Minnelli wags his finger at what happens to some people (cough, David O. Selznick, cough), while also showing too the joys of working in the business.
Before-hand, Johnathan asks an actor to keep Jim's clingy wife away for a while.
Their future leader, Liono is but a child when they leave their planet, but thanks to a pod malfunction he ages to an adult while the others in the group essentially stay the same age.
In a time when heroes were macho beyond macho, Lion-O had the vulnerability of having the mind of a child trapped in the body of an adult, the result of his body aging while spending 10 Galacto years in a suspension capsule.
I left watching it for a while, cause I've been busy.. but then I got into it again.
I've had enough Hercules for a while.
How else to keep sane while watching these cheesy flicks sent by Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank?
For me, the best part of this movie was Lauren as the assassin, as her character killed the G-man while she was having sex with him.
I loved seeing that while he was dying, that she held him in his arms, showing the right combination of power, sexual excitement, strength, and even a touch of compassion.
"The Full Monty" was an excellent movie in its own right, but while "Calendar Girls" captures the same humor and realness, it adds a little something more: heart.
I can't say I loved the movie--the script, while well-written, is scattershot and the light, low-key tone was TOO low-key for me.
Of course the chances of this happening while you live in a client state of the US is slim.
The film ends with the dramatic assassination in which Romero was gunned down in the church while performing the communion ceremony for his congregation.
This movie is one of the better I've seen in a while, I would check it out.
Basically, it showed her sneaking downstairs to snag some of the formula while her husband went to town (what did she do to get the drug all those months when her husband DIDN'T go to town?)
And how come hubby wasn't homicidal while taking the same formula?!?
It builds up very nicely, but I still do not get it why the doctor while drinking beer starts to bleed more and more (suicide?.
This has been the worst movie that I have seen in quite a while!
And as for this film itself, it was directed by an old master who had been out of it for a while.
The latter theme dominated the film, while the former only appeared in the background.
One of my very favorite films has the exact same theme: _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_, where people attempt to love each other in Czechoslovakia while the Soviets oppress them.
Micol identifies with her childhood and could not let go of it in relation to her childhood sweetheart, Georgio, even while her physical desires develop and intrude.
Prior to that, while in France, Georgio was told of the Nazi horrors and how one man escapes by shedding his identity and saying he has converted to Nazism.
The garden is still seductively attractive, the country around it still relatively free, but will we follow the course the Finzi-Continis took or will we come actively out of our garden while there is time?
Coming after a couple of stories , one of which is considered to be a modern classic ( The Impossible Planat/Satan Pit ) while the other ( Love And Monsters ) is one of the most radical pieces of television produced Fear Her was never going to be all that well received , but its Luke warm reception is to do mainly with the fact it's a very dull predictable story   If you watched the " next time " trailer from the previous week then you'll know in advance as to what the story is about and therefore there's no suspense .
There were times while watching the film, mostly in the first fifty minutes, that I thought this was one of Bergman's best, by giving his control somewhat over to the actors, who are all sensational.
Some are pretty viable (indestructable head gear) while others are just plain silly (inummerable flying machines) but all show a lot of imagination behind the madness.
i just happened to catch this recently on a rainy sunday while eating breakfast.i thought i would warn anyone thinking of renting this (i saw it on cable) that there are literally only two items worth checking out this lame movie.
I like how he is admired by the little kids of the town, while everyone else knows he is full of crap.
The movie, while being fairly lofty in content, is nonetheless very accessible given the the audiences predisposition to honest engagement and unbiased scrutiny.
â is turned every once in a while into a rabid axe-wielding murderer!
Unsurprisingly, the rest of the characters are even less engaging and only serve to raise the yawn factor: the heroine â who sets the plot in motion by going in search of her missing sister â is introduced while doing an idiotic vaudeville number in Vegas with two dubious hunks and, apparently, was the directorâs own wife in real life; the cop on the case is played by a bewildered Jim Davis; helping the girl are a trio of hippies, and harassing the lot are a gang of bikers (led by a spaced-out Russ Tamblyn sporting a huge head of hair and whose scenes were seemingly intended for another film, a sequel to SatanâS SADISTS [1969] from the same director!
Additionally, he had lost an eye and could not remember his lines, so he read from cue cards--and you could literally watch his one good eye darting back and forth while the glass one remained still.
Dracula and Frankenstein in this are pretty interesting, Dracula has some pretty strange ability to speak in echoes, while not using any visible devices, and he's missing make-up on his eyelids.
He decided to shoot framing scenes adding the whole Dracula-Frankenstein angle later on, and the whole package goes as follows...  Mad Dr. Frankenstein (J. Carroll Naish) is busy at work reconstructing dead bodies while retarded manservant Groton (Lon Chaney, Jr.) spends most of the time whimpering and petting a puppy.
Technically Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is a bit of a mess, there are some awful day-for-night shots, the performances have to be seen to be believed, the music gets on the nerves after a while, the props & sets are cheap & the photography is point & hope for the best stuff.
By the way, while not a great film, it's a very good film and one even curmudgeons can enjoy.
The Real world is no doubt the most overrated TV show in television history, to say it's better than classics like sanford and son, all in the family, the dick van dyke show and the jeffersons is a joke, those who think of it, must be on some kind of acid trip, The Real world basicially made generation x go stale and teens bore to death, to compare this one to trauma life in the er is like comparing a alvin and the chipmunks to the smurfs trauma is about real life situations, while the real world is about stupidity eric nies is the most cheesist actor ever and the rest are terrible The real world along with many talk shows are the beginning of the downfall of TV in America.
It oughta come with sub-titles, and while they're at it, make another movie.
And just for the record - this is the only movie that have actually managed to make me feel like a brainless weirdo who should go and bite my hands off, while I dance like a idiot.
"Mad Max" is art, while this movie is not.
I bought this movie on DVD (I trusted IMDb rating too much those days) and I think I will have to throw it away, while there are too many scenes which I want to skip.
We are supposed to get a sense of irony out of Alex going from a sociopath to someone who is constantly being beaten and tortured while he can't use the very thing that got him in the situation, violence, to help himself.
We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.
It is hilarious to see a detective trying to work while fighting extreme obsessive/compulsive behavior, as well as germaphobia strong enough to merit using anti-bacterial wipes after every handshake.
I saw this movie on it's original release and thought that it was just an exciting and hilarious ground breaking film ( I believe it had an X rating for a while ), and after seeing it again on DVD - I think it's a masterpiece.
The only difference being an average person is a closeted immoral, while Alex does his dirty job in the open.
I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful.
I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have.
Last night's episode about the murderous marathon runner was fantastic, and I laughed out loud at Monk's antics on the jogging trail while he tries out the new running shoes given to him by his "guru."
Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside.
I have watched this movie about 3 times in the past 2 years, the first time was while I was in Iraq for my second time.
Post traumatic stress does exist, it has taken a while for me to stop missing being deployed, I missed the camaraderie, my buddies, and the excitement of deployment life, and no it was not about baby killing and slaughter.
Susan Sarandon plays Jones' wife, and, while I usually dislike her as an actress, she brought me to tears in the scene where she learns of her son's death.
We haven't seen Tommy Lee Jones on the big screen here for a while, so his presence is a major plus point, catching the thespian in action.
Like her role in North Country, her Detective Emily Sanders also has to do battle with prejudice, discrimination and the glass ceiling, all these while being a single parent, and assisting Hank in cutting through layers of cover ups, and the determination of red herrings as the cop who requested to be assigned the case.
Moreover, Hank required somebody on the system to be working it, while the other slowly opened up to the fact that she is here to assist a parent in seeking answers.
And as such, while Haggis this time doesn't overwhelm with too many subplots and focused on the depth of the lead characters so wonderfully fleshed out by Lee Jones and Theron, this one's a winner.
Despised by her male colleagues who feel she has slept her way to detective status, she goes from traffic patrol to Truth Fairy while juggling life as a single mom.
The young soldier wasn't killed while heroically trying to uncover a dark secret.
But isn't this experience, this let down while watching the movie, a lot like our real life experience of the past 4 years?
A scene - with Zoe Karzan's Angie pleading for help from Charlize Theron's Emily while Hank awaits his turn to speak to Emily.- is ever so heart-wrenchingly memorable.
Is victory only associated with those unscathed and unblemished by wars while the maimed, the dead, and the mentally displaced are being swept under the carpets?
Deerfield soon understands, however, that it is not enough to fight your own fears in standing up to an adversary but it is necessary to treat the enemy as a human being while still doing your job.
The notion that war _necessarily_ results in moral breakdown is, while hardly novel, also not true.
Equally up to the challenge is Theron, in a strong performance, whose detective is a single mother who must battle her own squad and superiors while trying to solve a mystery.
Yes, it had an additional "look what we're doing to our kids" anti-war message (which was driven home in the scene where he's finally leaving his son's barracks and this young, pimply faced kid starts settling in), and yes, it was a murder mystery, but the method in which Haggis portrays the different behaviors the characters exhibit while trying to deal with extremely stressful and traumatic experiences was the main point of the movie.
Mrs. Deerfield: "Then don't") Â Deakins has the camera up on the stairs looking directly down on her while she sits hunched over on the floor.
That said, while not as acrobatic, Kitano shoots people with all the detached cool Chow Yun Fat wishes he had.
As the Anan clan increases it's grip on the other clan supported by Takeshi, they flee to a beach where they remain safe for a while.
But, despite their having fun while wasting away the hours, it's only a matter of time before the path of violence and death will escalate.
The "sumo scene" is so delightfully out-of-place, while the ending simply leaves your mouth open.
It is true that when Ruth played each team played 154 games while in 1961 there were already 162, but the fact is that in any league or championship it is a real feat to bat 61 homers, and this is what Maris did.
The first one was the most beloved Yankee player at that time while Maris came to the team just in 1960, so he was not so admired as Mickey.
There's another scene where someone threatens to kidnap one of Maris' kids while Mickey is over there for a barbecue.
And while a strong effort in getting look alikes can never completely pay off with so many people involved, how about Barry Pepper as Maris?
And on top of all that, I often find sports biography movies to be disappointing, often leaving out important details while at the same time over-Hollywoodizing.
i must say the twist at the end had me shocked.i didn't expect it.i believed the whole thing to the twist.amazing.i loved Simbhu in both characters.more so Manmadhan than the twin.i loved Simbhu as a psycho.can't wait for Vallavan (the sequel).this movie is highly recommended.Simbhu is too good in this one.Jyothika is awesome.everyone else is perfectly casted.songs are amazing.i love En Asai Mythiliye and Thathai Thathai the most.the most amazing movie i've seen in a while.
In one scene one "climber" (I say that oh so tongue in cheek) belays another by just standing there (he is tied onto the rope though)while his buddy holds a hundred feet or so of loosely coiled rope in his hands between the "belay" and the prospective climber.
The ones where someone with the fear of flying lands the airplane with one wing, no wheels and after all the crew die after all drinking coffee spiked by a scorned lover, while callous Corporate overlords cover up the shoddy maintenance schedule of the aircraft.
I also like the way they have "fine tuned" the characters and their interactions in the ensuing years, and while enjoying Bitty Schram, I personally prefer Traylor Howard.
It's a case of Alfred Hitchcock successfully parodying himself, while in the meantime offering some memorable cinematic moments.
Septugenarian ex-sea captain Albert Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) is worried that he might have accidentally shot the man while hunting for rabbits.
Some may say it's a rip-off of such films as Single White Female and Misery, while it is true it takes inspiration from these films, it really does stand on it's own two feet and if I may say...knocks the socks off Single White Female.
", while Whitbread whistles a self-composed ditty entitled 'Penis From Heaven' ), but strangely, the film is a lot tamer than you might expect.
Edwin's meeting's with Percy's girlfriends brings us glorious sightings of Britt Ekland and Elke Sommer, while Julia Foster, Cyd Hayman, Adrienne Posta, Gaye Brown, Tracy Reed, and Sheila Steafel, and Sue Lloyd appear elsewhere.
George Best graces a 'Billy Liar'-styled fantasy sequence, while Arthur English is seen as a seedy pub comic.
What struck me most about this film was not only the realism in all three situations, but how each one of the stories showed that "Pro-Choice" is not always "Pro-Abortion"; a fact that those of us who support a woman's right to chose will be all too glad to point out while those of the stauncher anti-choice fold may be a little slow to admit.
The struggle that each woman faces in this film is unique, and while another reviewer mistakenly commented that each instance was merely 'clichÃ©', I will argue that each instance was REAL.
And while violence against abortion providers isn't an every day occurrence, there are people in our society who wish that were the case-- and including this scene in the film shows us, in graphic detail, the hypocrisy of that opinion.
I had time to waste, and this wasted time while being entertaining.
I think someone let a group of college kids get a hold of nice camera equipment while on spring break in Europe.
The original film while considered fluff by many at least had some wonderful chemistry between the leads whereas there is zilch between Luke and Kam.
This movie is a pleasant surprise that returns faith in American movie, the faith that has been suffering for a long while, recovering just rarely by Tim Burton's work or movies like "Eternal Sunshine..."   We Â especially us who live outside USA Â have been exposed to so much Hollywood vain, shallow, plastic movies in range from superhero action violence and funless teen comedies to the worst movie blasphemies - remakes, that we use to forget that there are small movies untouched by Hollywood lethal sauce.
Adrift in Manhattan is more European style than any American movie I've seen for a long while; even more, it is more European style than many European movies made in last two decades.
And as we follow these people, we will see how some relations terminate because of total loss of communication, while others appear and develop once the shell softens.
The story De Villa weaves is one of interaction of these characters by almost serendipitous incidents, moments that change their lives - at least for a while.
An example could be the scene where he is watching the soccer match and is (seemingly) playing with himself while imitating the player who's talking on TV.
But while the movie is choppy as a whole, some of the scenes are breathtakingly raw.
Marcos, deep in concentration while driving on a beautiful day, is cursed and spat upon in a scene of road rage, the music of Bach's elegant Concerto in D minor blares at a tawdry gas station, and a scene of touching farewell is suddenly marred by an unspeakable crime.
I have never been less scared while watching a "horror" film than this.
I saw Battle in Heaven at this year's Cannes film festival, and though I had trouble sitting still and keeping my eyes on the screen, the end result was an incredibly interesting movie that experimented with new ideas, while most of the films at Cannes this year were just recycling the same ideas and techniques.
There was also a good match of Hack as a college student (another actress) while in some films it is not believable at all.
It's been a while since I acquired a headache from a movie.
It is sweet justice watching the lesbian partners express the husband's insignificance by gently lowering their partner's head while ignoring his whines.
Sophisticated while being silly, sly, witty, wry, insightful, ironic -- for mature people with a high degree of self-awareness, self-honesty & ability to recognize and accept the fluidity of human sexuality.
as i grew up i forgot about BaBar then after a while i began thinking about what my favorite TV show was.
I believe Burger's biggest point was to demonstrate the bond the the army has on each other and how they would go to big lengths to make sure one another is OK and safe while of course testing one another with impossible questions.
All three end up at an evangelical service and McAdams stands up to testify, blithely telling embarrassing secrets about her companions while they cringe.
Two of them are on thirty day leaves while the other has served his time and is on his way home.
In the very early 80s, a little while before Schwarzenegger/Stallone and a good while before Seagal/Van Damme, Chuck Norris enjoyed a period where he was pretty much the number one name in action movies.
On this 1990's version, Burke was still as sharp as ever, big name guest stars abounded just like in the Sixties, and for a little while CBS looked like it had showcased a nice revival of a classy Sixties favorite to its lineup.
As the father is a workaholic, his son is always in trouble, his passed-wife's brother has no job so hes staying with them, while his daughter is more like an adult than a kid.
But while the males go about staging the mock funeral, the women, led by the mayor's energetic wife, take over the action and, in turn, decide to "sacrifice" themselves to the soldiers.
Some joined militant groups, went on suicide missions or were killed while defending their home.
The death scenes are said to take influence from Argento's films, and while none of them are actually the same; the brutality is definitely there.
Do not Know, but while most of the people condemn the acting in this movie, I find him to be the only one to condemn.
Though in some ways predictable the plot is worked out in solid fashion with a punchy and satisfying finale and while the pace is a bit slow there are enough notable moments to smooth the ride.
3)Micheal Madsen looks like he shot for the movie while going for a walk and did it just for the goggles.
Roberts being the most pathetic and stupid looking "hero" ever running around like a complete idiot and trying to clean things up while the stupid president is being kidnapped by a wannabe psycho.
There was even a time when I HAD to stop while entering a canyon with stormy clouds above.
I know that if you hold the right stick in the same position the camera will remain fixed, but try doing that while also holding on to the triangle button, it's nearly impossible!
The director actually turns this into a meditation on the zing one gets from successfully doing puzzles while allowing you to take sides with one or more of the fanatics.
One of them even admits to "playing at" being a farmer while not at his "home" in Chicago.
A couple had sex somewhere, get lost and the girl - full of drugs - is raped by the man who gets her out of the water of a fountain while she is sleeping.
The succubus kills people, and nobody seems to notice for a while.
The movie's about this wannabe satanist, who gives incantations to Satan while sitting at his bedside wearing his Def Leppard t-shirt, then dreams of this ugly chick who is supposed to be Satan incarnate, or a succubus.
While at a public execution a kind hearted woman named Maria (Rona De Ricci) speaks out against the inquisition & it's methods, straight away she is accused of being a witch & carted off to be tortured while her baker boyfriend Antonio (Jonathan Fuller) is left for dead.
Some of these women have been free to explore their sexuality while some don't even know what an orgasm is (even after marriage).
Instead we're presented with someone who proclaims her alleged freedom while showing us how miserable her decision to be "free" makes her.
The peasants look like they're wearing day-glow rags, while the lush Southeast Asian forests are represented by someone's back forty.
He loves her madly, while her feelings for him are difficult to understand.
I really enjoyed while watching this movie.
A hard luck woman(Robin Wright Penn)tries to make for a better life while her volatile husband(Sean Penn)spends ten years in the 'looney bin'.
Maureen left her children to be with her lover, she drank while pregnant, and she's dumb as rocks, but you have to look past the character flaws and focus on what this story is about.
His debut - the brilliant Re-Animator - was a comedy splatter movie while The Pit and the Pendulum doesn't contain that much violence or gore.
A dead man is found in their back yard, that they had seen while eating dinner the night before and the two start their own investigation as to who the man was and why is everyone being blackmailed.
Look at the cast- while they aren't all considered "A-list", they are favs among horror and cult fans- Lance Henriksen (Millennium, Aliens) Tom Towles (Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer), Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, From Beyond), Frances Bay (Blue Velvet), Oliver Reed...
That being said, they are very different while maintaining the same basic mood.
And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of "Delicatessen" truly become the movie's soul.
Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic "La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus"), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome.
Dominique Pinon is an ex-circus clown who answers a personal ad doing odd jobs there and encounters assorted weirdos while being targeted as the main course.
"The Grifters") while others are exquisitely bad ("Warlords of Atlantis").
Unfortunately for them a giant Octopus attacks the Texas Rose & the crew, Grogan (Hal Galili), Fenn (John Ratzenberger), Jacko (Derry Power) & the Captain are taken while the young deckhand Sandy (Ashley Knight) is left behind with the now wounded Professor.
They are welcomed by a guy in a silver sequin dress named Atmir (Micheal Gothard) who takes them to the 3rd city of Troy, Charles is deemed clever so is separated from the group & taken to meet the supreme council who appear to be lead by Atraxon (Daniel Massey) & Astril (Cyd Charisse) while the others are condemned to a life of slavery & thrown into the dungeon's.
while on stage his date is suddenly kidnapped by ninjas.
while continuing to hold the mic and sing Steel defeats the ninjas and returns to the stage with a wink.
A would-be hillbilly-turn cop avenges his younger brother's murder in a lawful manner, while a third brother goes about it in typical redneck-hillbilly style, causing more problems and endangering them both, as well as the pregnant wife of Truman (Swayze).
His brother is killed and while on a trip back in the hills his other brother wants revenge so he comes back to the city to seek out his revenge.
In the end it is a bit different and while nothing spectacular it did entertain me.
To me, Tsui Hark constructed a BRILLIANT homage to the "hopping corpse," and "demon" movies of the 1980's and early 1990's while adding some great kung-fu sequences.
The main character kills a hooker and has sex with the dead body all the while filming it, because he's an angry premature ejeculater.
A film like "Pink Flamingos" only exists to shock viewers, while "Visitor Q" as disgusting as it is; is a social satire on modern Japan.
But I realized after a while Miike set it up from the beginning with Q suddenly entering into this world, and somehow for no actual reason being accepted.
It's a look at the disintegration of a family using a medium within its video-work (I was reminded of Godard's equally un-settling work of original sexually depraved and uncouth family in Numeroux Deux), and if taken really as being a serious work you might have to turn it off after a while.
I'd already seen Audition, and while I didn't like it much, I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it.
The characters themselves are all over the place, and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic, there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd!
Analyze This, while underrated by a lot of folks, is one of the best comedies you'll ever see.
This film has been out for quite a while.
The work begins with a voice-over by immigrant Joe Dekko (Colin Gray O'Hara), his text indicating inner turmoil, while he and two crime partners prepare for a robbery of two drug dealers.
Some in the audience were laughing while I felt like crying.
As an American, it took me a bit to get used to the language of rural Ireland in the 1920's, but this film draws you into a world that seems not at all foreign after a while.
As for "Believers" it pretty much follows the formula of "The Blair Witch Project", but while the twist in that movie consisted of surpassing our fear that the witch was real in "Believers" we are introduced to a bunch of frauds that in the very end...
We go back to the girls mother who goes through full conversion while the cultists complain that her daughter shouldn't be here (ermÂ put her somewhere else).
My theory is that Thadd Turner woke up from a drunken stupor and simply wrote down what he'd dreamed while under the influence of alcohol poisoning.
They decide to take a detour to get this gold while Trejo laughs... for minutes on end.
This flick while never something even approaching what someone might deem good, was enjoyable enough...up to a point.
The dialog is blessed with more expletives than Eddy Murphy Raw, while maintaining a fresh 'I've never heard actual conversations' kind of pace.
I love the part where Paul McGann asks the gunman to wait a moment while he discusses his relationship with the mother.
I went to see this film with a great deal of excitement as I was at school with the director, he was even a good friend of mine for a while.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
It's an uncompromising film, one that doesn't try to sugarcoat the sadder events of the plot for its younger viewers, and no matter how old you are, you may find yourself in tears more than once while watching it.
while this is a romantic comedy, the comic aspects of the story are adjunctive to the seriousness of the charges for which both defendants face death.
My most vivid memory of the movie was that after seeing the theatrical release and thinking it was hysterical, I rented it while on vacation with my folks.
De Niro and Crystal are absolutely outstanding, infusing their characters with every possible nuance, while successfully avoiding the stereotypes that lesser actors may have relied upon here.
All the while, the likable Kudrow more than holds her own with her co-stars, proving, unequivocally, that there is so much more to her than just being a great `Friend.'
The most memorable, though, is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie `The Godfather,' when he is shot while buying some fruit.
The deep downside is the latter portion: a climatic courtroom scene that, while up to the point of interest, runs terribly long and weak....until one of the film's cast members gets into the act!
Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long, virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy, baby looking face.
As a trial lawyer let me say that the portrayal of courtroom events, while certainly not perfect, is more than adequate and passable.
But as if by fate, one day he got bit by a radioactive spider, and while that might seem unlucky, it gave him the strength of a spider if it was his size, and the ability to climb walls, and shoot webbing.
To be fair, while most of them are wretched, this one isn't so awful, despite the almost total absence of anything approaching a gag.
Granted, I felt a sort of cognitive dissonance while watching.
The direction and photography was of a high standard while the supporting cast was adequate if not in the same league as our pals.
Marie and Fernando agree in letting them stay with them for a while, something that Anna doesn't appreciate since her cousin only speaks Spanish.
It is also remarkable because while most French movies let you know what characters think simply by having them talk endlessly, Anna keeps her words short and to the point and the adults around her never seem to explain things as much as they ought to.
This is a quiet, thoughtful movie and it took me a while to get into it, perhaps simply because I approach French movies with a certain amount of suspicion, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8.
Despite the inherently ideological nature of the material, writer/director Julie Gavras, the daughter of famed filmmaker Costa-Gavras, keeps most of the political stuff in the background while she concentrates on the strain the grownups feel as they strive to juggle their save-the-world activities with their duties as parents.
While little FranÃ§ois is able to go along with the life changes, Anna rebels and refuses to alter her goals and needs merely for the 'fad' of her father's frequent trips to Chile while leaving behind her mother to continue writing articles for the ('bourgeois') French magazine Marie-Claire!
Her parents Â just like Anna's ones Â have always been leftist activists and wasn't her dwelling-place invaded by Chilean "barbudos" while her dad was preparing "Missing"?
To while away her time she has mastered ping pong, half a dozen musical instruments, martial arts, tumbling, juggling, pinhole cameras, and so on.
It also becomes a romantic movie for a little while, with Penelope's infectious enthusiasm being rubbed off and onto Bloom, that bit of optimism dousing out the negativity constantly felt by the latter, and get you in the mood to cheer both of them on as well.
Eastern Europe provided much of the picturesque backdrop on which the story got told, jet-setting from one locale to another, while the costumes and suits used in the film, primarily in black and/or white, were simply gorgeously designed, that you'd do a double take at how pretty they look (or is it because the stars have the charisma to carry them off).
But also Rinko Kikuchi acts very well as the explosive expert that seem to have taken a vow of silence (except while singing karaoke of course).
But there's an ambiguity established while we're enjoying ourselves: is this movie fundamentally about the Brothers Bloom, or about their last con, an eccentric, beautiful young heiress named Penelope Stamp?
From the age of 10, the brothers are con-artists, always spinning yarns and creating characters, inventing new and increasingly elaborate ways of separating their mark from his money while also giving him exactly what he wants in life.
It's one of those rare films that keeps you watching while the story is flying by.
After the death of his mother, into his life comes a whirlwind of a well-meaning shyster in the form of Alonzo Turner (aka Robbie Coltrane), at once turning his life upside-down while simultaneously bringing out the inner opera-loving Renzo.
Riding a swing at the side of the boat, she smiles sweetly at the old man, while he, from afar in another boat, fires 3 arrows onto a picture of Buddha.
He had plans to marry the girl when she turns 17, and hurriedly brings forward his plan, while driving the young man away.
Also, the couple is able to predict the future through an odd divination in which the girl swings in a swing attached to the boat in front of an image of the Buddha while the man shoots three arrows into the Buddha.
The ending is a story in itself, but I honestly felt embarrassed for Kim Ki-Duk while I watched it.
After having sex, the old man spirit allows the girl and the guy to go back to shore while he sinks together with his ship.
The visitors (impure thoughts) were attempting to spoil the purity of his soul while he was protecting it with the bow (his focused consciousness, or could be by a state of meditation, because in a meditation the mind becomes as focused as the arrow shot from a bow).
Ioana Moldovan is an attractive woman, and perform well as Isabelle Benny, the prince's love interest while wondering as a young man in Paris, however, she looks more like a tramp, instead of the supposedly poor and simply dressed French girl.
MY psychotronic powers must need a little work: This movie continued for quite a while after I WILLED it to end.
Mixed with fistfights with no visual interest, a very dumb and not plausible shooting while running scene where one cannot shoot another from 2 meters, and endless slow paced and useless scenes that should have been cut out or not even be shot to start with.
This may actually be a good thing as it removes the demons of his haunted past and allows Maria the chance to be the weak protagonist for a while.
The actors and the direction are great, while the art direction is stunning.
Overall this movie is a great blend of drama and awesome action scenes while also having a fair bit of humor, and I would heartily recommend it to any movie-goer.
His first magazine was entitled "Household Words", and while publishing it he decided to enhance it's readership by writing a novel.
But while noting Louisa's trysts with Harthouse, Mrs.Sparskit also notes a mysterious elderly woman who is constantly coming to see Josiah.
The theme song is great but overused and after a while I got sick and tired of staring at the young lead actress' naked body.
Once while attending the Garden State Film Festival and a second time in my home town in the Connecticut Film Festival.
Gianna was given carte blanche by Nancy's mother Dorothy to live in her own place while operating a studio on the estate.
But, instead Nancy begins to seduce them, while also turning Gianna and Marco against each other through cunning manipulation..but, while quite drawn to Nancy, neither actually ever trusts her.
It's been a while since I've seen a film done this well and how refreshing considering the garbage that they consider films nowadays.
The filmmakers did a beautiful job of capturing the excitement of the adventure while still maintaining the humanity and innocence of the two boys, played perfectly by Jesse James and Reilly McClendon.
And while there may be a few elements too rough for the youngest viewers, this is still a great film for the whole family.
This is a rare Giallo in that, by the conclusion, most aspects of it make sense and while Smile Before Death is hard to track down, I recommend making the effort!
The latter film is primarly concerned with philosophical issues pertaining to man's relationship with the universe, while Suburban Commando has a much tighter focus, presenting the individual as a mirror reflecting the socio-politcal values of the "new" deomcracy in which he finds himself captive.
Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film.
Might explain why he's been paying a local hooker (played by 70s drive-in favorite Roberta Collins) to dress up like his long gone momma and "play dead" while he undresses and gropes her.
The opening scene is a childhood flashback of a woman stripping naked, taking off her earrings and lying down in bed while a pair of kids tennis shoes are visible behind a barely opened curtain.
Dushku fastens on to the CCC connection while everyone else pooh poohs it.
Watch it when it comes on TV...and watch it as the background ambiance while playing World of Warcraft or as your bedtime going-to-sleep movie.
A handsome and lonely gym teacher Eddie Collins can't perform sexually due to his constant watching of his mother undress while he hid in her closet as a child.His only recourse is to kill the women he tries to sleep with and stash them in a pigeon hutch on his roof.He hires a prostitute to dress as his dead mother,the only way he is able to achieve sexual gratification..."The Arousers" is the first film of director Curtis Hanson.Originally shot in 1971 under the title "Sweet Kill",this film lingered on the shelf until 1973 when executive producer Roger Corman had Hanson shoot two days of nudity inserts to spice-up the film.Angus Scrimm of "Phanatsm" fame has a small cameo here.Overall,this is a good piece of sleaze from the early 70's that should satisfy the exploitation fans out there looking for plenty of nudity,sex and violence.7 out of 10.
while it might not rank with the Cagney genre of gangster movies, for a crime drama, it catches the angst a decent detective trying to find the logic in the irrational might feel.
It had been a while since I really saw him perform anything close to his Aikido moves.
The direction shows little flair, (to be kind), while the screenplay virtually non existent.
His leathery skin clearly makes him invulnerable to conventional weapons, and while he does his usual twist/lock work, he's also forced to do some strikes that are simply pathetic.
The acting sucks, Seagal minus pony tail mumbles his way through the film as usual while Luke Goss has managed to put this turkey behind him having appeared in the recent Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008).
I actually watched Black Dawn the next day and while Seagal was doubled for all his fight scenes the movie was much funner to watch than MFJ.
It had been a while since I really saw him perform anything close to his Aikido moves.
If you watch this, DON'T RENT, and find a plot please let me know what it is because while watching the 84 minutes of this trash, in between the horrible acting and watching Seagal being out of breath, I couldn't find one.
It was like watching a toddler trying to control the camera steady while learning to walk.
Seeger holds a gun to Drasham's head from the backseat while having difficulty spitting out his witless dialogue.
Another thankful gesture to his loyal fans in this film is Seagal actually does his own fighting, and while the fight scenes are less impressive, at least it's him doing it.
Having been a Seagal fan for a while, I must say I was pleased by this film.
Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial, as well as her medical files (which are now in private access for John Locke), all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols.
Christy is sent to Pine Bluff Psychiatric Care Center for treatment while her sister is treated by her husband Dr. John Locke (Matthew Settle) at home with the assistance of the nurse Claire Wells (Eliza Norbury).
Christy has mysterious blackouts with strange visions and decides to investigate the death of her sister that she believes had been buried alive, disclosing a dark secret, while the locals believe she has borderline personality disorder.
This film isn't apologetic about taking its subjects fairly seriously, even while not getting too solemn or "taking *itself* too seriously" in the bad sense.
But there's an entirely different kind of crummy moviemaking that actually came to mind as a contrast to Henry and June while I was watching this, and that was Moulin Rouge.
Please excuse me for using one movie as a club to bash another, but while watching H & J I really felt this connection and contrast.
She gets the chance when her husband Hugo brings Henry to stay with them while he works on his novel.
Actually Maria de Medeiros was quite good; the combination of her appearing to be naive while having an erotic mind was very well done.
This is a film with a tough subject matter, handled with the utmost dignity, and makes a social statement while glowing as a superb independent film.
Actually while it was exciting to see a play with Robarts and Dewhurst in it the latter had a small cameo role and only appeared in the final act (where she did a comic bit about dancing with Rabb).
It reminds us that while so many people are merrily eating dinner and opening presents, a number of individuals - possibly more than half of us - are struggling just to get by, with or without tragedy striking.
My reaction while seeing it was that if this had been a foreign film with a no-name cast, it would have been praised for "defying the canons of conventional storytelling" or something like that.
This pushing us out to pasture while the fart joke movies dominate makes me sick.
First, while watching this movie I laughed harder than I ever have before.
Part of me admires it for its hard edged eco message coupled with its violent action packed adventure elements while part of me hates it for its convienent mystical mumbo jumbo when the script requires Tomme and the invisible people to escape from a tight spot .
Grab a beer or 6 and some pretzels, but try not to drink to fast or you may end up doing spit takes while watching this.
Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing, but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end, although I somehow managed to get through it all.
But I'm digressing: if you have a nostalgic love for old superhero movies, are not opposed to a little parody on the US and Australia alike, and are willing to follow that film in its occasionally whimsy turns, this is your choice for a late night film with friends (and don't forget to "Have a short or a Port or a snort of any sort" while watching)!
This one is supposed to be a sequel to some "Blood Cult", but as far as direct-to video goes, this one features the usual shots of people wandering endlessly waiting to be killed while others go on about their business, waiting to discover the bodies.
it seems that for a brief while (in that decade where anything went) if you could conceive a story so depraved, and so totally wrong, there was a good chance of getting it made.
The two adults of the central cast have very distinct elements about their personality that are very easy to dislike, while even the young girl is the not the sweetness and innocence that you would expect.
It all boils down to a typically shocking conclusion and while this film definitely won't float everybody's boat, it is a very interesting thriller one that is definitely worth seeing.
A welcome surprise is the appearance of veteran Hollywood star Mel Ferrer (as Gastoni's wheelchair-bound cynic of a husband) who adds some much needed dignity to the proceedings; while he had been appearing sporadically in Italian films since 1954, interestingly, his role here does not feel like a mere "meal ticket" Â unlike some of his other Italian film work of the period, namely THE ANTICHRIST (1974), THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS (1975), etc.
Unfortunately, Howard Ross' one-dimensional characterization of the rapist/serial killer sticks out like a sore thumb alongside this caliber of acting and, in any event, the actions of the characters strain credibility on occasion Â Ferrer is conspicuously absent most of the time (although he is inherently aware of all that goes on in his household and his eventual suicide arises more out of selfishness than resignation at his crippled condition or the immorality of his kinfolk), not to mention the fact that the investigating police officer decides to consummate his obsession with Gastoni while the manhunt for the rapist is in full swing.
The premise really is not funny, and while this may have had some shock value in its day, because Hopkins certainly played it brazen, it is very hard to find cute.
Hopkins -- "I know we had a gentlemen's agreement, but I'm not a gentleman" (saying this to Cooper while lying provocatively on a couch); March -- "Delicacy is the banana-peel under the feet of Truth"; Cooper -- "Let's drink to smallpox", to which March adds, "In Latin, Variola Cocca!"
Subsequently, while attending Tom's smash comedy, Max is amazed to hear the line sprouted by a pompous figure on stage.
The director went and lived for a short while with the Xingu tribe in the amazon.
The moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so French and ambiguous, it's a happy/sad one.
As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people I would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours!
So the next time I see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; I'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it.
The score is also far too fluffy, or at least it is for my liking; and the screenplay, while subtle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, ultimately leaving me almost baffled.
(The story, while nice, is really incidental.
I thought the angle of the modern age clashing with tribal customs in the form of Tommy to be the strong point of the film while the progress part of the film as it pertains to the cultures being wiped out laid on a bit too thick.
But while we indulge in wistful scenery, the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset, and we have to wait a few seasons to past, and 45 minutes into the film, before they find a leveler in food.
Also, it was hard not to be reminded of Jungle2Jungle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119432/) while watching it now, especially where the son mystically finds his father's skyscraper apartment in a large city.
Good for gore in the last 20 minutes or so, while most of the action is confined to the short intro sequence in Viet Nam (which was decently well done).
Norman Hopper (the great John Saxon) is on a mission to save Prisiners of war while on a tour of duty in Vietnam.
Unfortunately, years before, the commanding officer was also bitten while trying to rescue these poor soldiers, but has been pretty good at keeping his "sickness" at bay.
This movie, while having rich and deep cheese deposits, also actually has some quality to it.
She then reveals herself as an unhinged psychotic while blowing him (um, with the dryer) while he's trying to have an important phone conversation (with another unhinged psychotic), which would earn a punch in the mouth from me (but I am not susceptible to nubile vixens).
His presence (which was purely to justify US funding) is initially surprising and intriguing, but he was allegedly very difficult for the crew to work with, and extremely high and mighty while on set.
It seems to serve no purpose at all, and yet at one point is thrust up into Nastassja Kinski's womb, and at another has its throat cut on camera while it's still wriggling and crying.
Christopher Lee was very unhappy with these scenes, while Dennis Wheatley was revolted and said afterwards that Hammer would never again adapt one of his stories Â though neither Wheatley nor Hammer would live to see this defiance tested.
Nanny by now has become friends with Peter, even to the point of his letting her use the apartment to write in while he's in the office and Iris is still out of town.
It is disappointing that the alluring Gene Tierney does not have a more interesting part and is more or less limited to being 'the wife', while her husband Van Heflin does all the acting.
It's rare to see this film although it's shown on Fox Movie Channel once in a while.
Some sequences just go on and on without getting swiftly to its point, while it easily could.
So, while that is going on, Jake gets with Keri, meets his brother, Billy (Matthew Barry), etc.
I watched this on BBC 2 a short while ago and thought it was brilliant.
The script begins to tighten its focus and, while much of the film owes its existence to Romero's "Dead" trilogy, it also throws in a couple of unexpected twists of its own.
Add to that an unexpected, underlying morality and some of the most creative one-shots I've seen in a while (the zombie who eats himself, for example) and you've got a helluva ride.
Somebody in the production crew was very fond of the Japanese cyber-punk subgenre because whenever someone turns into a zombie the camera is undercranked while they shake their heads violently back and forth.
If I were writing a script about the making of this movie I would have had a few friends sitting around after watching Shawn of the Dead and Day of the Living Dead (original) while getting high and munching on Rice Krispie treats and canned chili.
And they got it made while most people sit around criticizing something that they have never done themselves.
The actors decide to stay in a house surrounded by zombies all the while they have a car outside...
You see a lot of blood that looks black and congealed running out of one wound while there's fresh red blood running out of another wound (This being on the same body at the same time).
A terrible unprofessional looking film with an awful script,scene chewing acting and cartoonish "special effects".The plot is a silly unexplained mix of zombies and skin disease with the characters mostly standing around in a house and wondering what is happening while their neighbors all mill around outside and shake their heads really really fast.I guess the fast head shaking is supposed to scare us or something.I'm mostly scared I'll accidentally rent another movie made by this crew.
Certainly, quite early on in his career, Jimmy Lydon was "trapped" in the Henry Aldrich series and while "Life With Father" may have been his most prestigious film, "Strange Illusion" gave him his best role.
It's a film that I had been wanting to see for a while.
Later, while we watch him try to sweet-talk Virginia into to an early marriage, all the while subtly looking over the daughter, we know the ghost in Paul's dream was right on.
True, poor old Robert Young does get jostled out of the picture for a while, but he does return with a couple of hilarious solo routines, including his famous toppling-over-the-balcony bit at the opera.
This is the kind of light escapist entertainment that weary wartime GIs were crazy about--and Lana looks sensational while giving an expert performance.
Many people that have seen this movie have labelled it a Giallo, and while the film does have it's Giallo moments in the first half - I'd put Spider Labyrinth in with the robust Gothic horror films such as Kill Baby Kill, Inferno and Suspiria before listing it amongst the likes of Solange and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage.
Even while the film isn't making a whole lot of sense, however, it still remains interesting by way of its atmosphere.
For the rest, you are left to stare, speechless, at a sequence of extremely dumb scenes, while you ask yourself what's the point in them.
Depardieu, while one of the world's great actors, has never been at his best trying to act in English.
Some parts were overly predictable, while the story flowed rather easily.
Indulgent, while Vishnu whiles away his time with his cronies taking life easy.
Here we see flinty eyed accountants and oh-so-serious market researchers uncontaminated by artistry using film as a corporate tool,in the process producing a movie that while technically excellent has neither soul nor spirit.
So while he tries to seduce her, his butler (Terence Stamp) is concerned to get rid off the rest of the family.
Indulgent, while Vishnu whiles away his time with his cronies taking life easy.
However, while Griffith has clearly moved on in his direction and arrangement of actors, it lacks the dynamism of the earlier film.
It's chilling to read the next title, "At the Shop the New Foreman Weeds Out the Old Hands," and then to watch while a cold-hearted gent with a bushy black mustache does precisely that: he struts about the carpentry shop, singles out each elderly employee, fires him, and puts a younger man in his place.
I had to hunt it down while visiting LA, but Judy Berlin is definitely worth catching.
Kavner plays a cafeteria lady while Anne Meare plays his secretary.
For while the formula of Wellington having a problem, sending to Sharpe to solve it, a beautiful woman getting involved and everything culminating in a massive pitched battle was well and truly in place by now, Sharpe's Battle takes pains to develop its characters further.
And while it may be a small point, they're given a subtle veneer of freshness by the absence of the standard red and blue infantrymen uniforms, replaced by the green and white of the palace guards and the fantastic looking French wolf pack with their grey uniforms decorated with wolf fur.
Kiely could very easily have been another pompous gentleman for Sharpe to clash with, but while he may fit the bill somewhat, he is far less stereotypical than the likes of Henry Simmerson, the slimy brute from Sharpe's Eagle.
Escape now while you have the chance.
Stereotypical 'bad' cops continually stalk the intrepid band of 'taggers' while 'Blest' (Mark Webber) truly is the most artistically blessed member of the gang as he readies an art exhibit of his best work.
She is reduced to one mannerism, an "oh dear oh dear oh dear" or some slight variation, while at the same time hovering near fondly remembered grandmotherisms.
This adaptation while taking some liberties with the book, is the best adaptation, and yes I do prefer it over the Helen Hayes version.
The script and plot are solid, while taking liberties with the book.
Anyway, I noticed that in the late 70's the group split ups this time had it where Fred and both the girls went off together leaving Shaggy and Scooby together to provide all the laughs as opposed to the Velma hanging with Shaggy and Scooby while Fred and Daphne paired off like the old series.
DYNOMUTT: DOG WONDER: This was not only a spin off to me from Scooby Doo, but also a parody of Batman and Robin, only in this case, the sidekick (a mechanical one) is the actual star while the hero is actually the costar.
Again, it is a misnomer to call this Cannibal Man, and I hated to have to watch a dubbed version, but Vicente Parra and Charly Bravo did an excellent job, while Emma Cohen was a real delight in this neo noir Spanish thriller.
In accordance with the film's original title, WEEK OF THE KILLER, Parra takes the part of the titular role, slowly spiraling downward into insanity while dispatching one victim for each day of the week.
And all the while, he's befriended by a peculiar young man named Nestor (Eusebio Poncela) who lives on the 13th floor of an upscale high-rise apartment right down the road and keeps an eye on what's going on around him with a pair of binoculars.
One night while out with his girlfriend Paula Marcos becomes involved in a fight with a taxi driver & ends up accidentally killing him.
Technically La Semana del Asesino is basic but professional enough, Iglesia films it in real locations which add to it's grittiness & credibility while at the same time giving the film a nice atmosphere throughout, the cinematography is OK, the music forgettable while the special effect's aren't going to impress too many people these days they are good enough.
Dante's glass is obviously half empty, while Randal's is constantly being refilled.
No movie as important as Clerks had been made in a great while.
I had a chance to see this film while attending the Sundance film festival last year.
We all have people like this in our lives, some one who has "made it" while we wait for the big breaks.
Due to Gillian Anderson's real-life pregnancy, she needed to be written out of the show for a little while to deliver her baby.
Wolheim, with his hilariously expressive face, has a slight advantage in the scene stealing category, while Boyd has the upper hand in the romantics department.
The Federal troops are dug in on one side of the river, while the Confederate troops have fortified themselves on the opposite bank.
Hollis smashes through a window, lands in the street and starts blasting away, while Duncan joins him.
The documentary,filmed mostly at his one man play/monologue/diatribe, on the last two performances should be worth you while.
The production design itself was very reasonable (apart from the odd dodgy special effects, and wobbly bedpost)  At one point, I was practically falling asleep while watching this film.
In encountering the Satan character for the first time, the woman appears nude, while we get a close-up of Satan's eye...talk about undressing someone with your eyes!
For the most part, this is very dream-like (or nightmare-like, to be more accurate), and while it's somewhat nonsensical it's still quite interesting and a far better offering than the other trash I've seen by this director.
I just learned of it today and, while I know it's silly, I've been sitting here at work getting teary-eyed.
Then our host explains to William that Peter and Evelyn are the repressed, dark sides of Dr. Will and Susan, and then William witnesses a bizarre ritual where Susan and Evelyn merge and make out with Peter while various nude and semi-nude people dance around, apparently (you guessed it) for Satan.
In twistier parts of the city, the sound often goes through all gears into 5th, while the visual speeds don't change much.
The title may be a bold claim for a movie that lasts less than 10 minutes, but while most movies last for 90 minutes, they can seem to be slightly boring in some parts, Rendezvous is not.
Starting off with a beating heart, the movie cuts to a rasping exhaust note of an unknown car, all taken from a camera mounted on the front of it, capturing the sights and sounds of 70's Paris, while the driver (who's face is never shown) extracts every ounce of performance out of said car.
The car in the movie is believed to be the director's own Ferrari 275 GTB, while the driver is said to be either an F1 driver or the director himself.
Yet, while on the surface the film appears to be a reckless, brainless car movie for petrolheads only, the underlying notion the movie exudes is love: Think about the location Paris, the most romantic city in the world.
"The Very Thought of You" tells the tale of one woman who encounters three men individually while starting her life over in the UK.
This is delightful, and quite smart in places, giving this production an overall slick execution, while not pushing the envelope so hard, as to detract from the work.
Anyway, the whole thing is a pretty obvious parable of WW2 with Eastman's character Vood as basically Hitler's caveman equivalent, though he goes around smashing things while his lady friend does all the talking for him.
And while James Bond is rewarded with the most beautiful girl after having saved the world, Ffolkes receives a completely different gift at the end of the film... All in all, "North Sea Hijack" is the perfect action thriller for a stormy and rainy autumn evening in front of your TV set.
I recorded it and watched it a couple of days later while laid low with the 'flu.
The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...  Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...
), but while the original was a masterwork of suspense and doubt, Disturbia disposes of the subtlety and goes straight in for the kill with a surprisingly greasy David Morse and clichÃ©s aplenty (blood spatter, dark and stormy nights...).
Kale has had a rough year, while driving his father back from their father/son fishing trip, they get into a horrible fatal car accident, the Father dies, but Kale is alive trying to deal with the guilt of what happened.
Serving as great comic relief is Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) while the new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), provides a romantic interest.
Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.
", while T.S.
I love the scenes where these boys try to turn the stage into rubble while trying to take out the head security guard.
If "Mallrats" had gone had tried to be serious while trying to also be slapstick, it was have fallen even further away from critics and the masses alike.
I really loved it when he just lashed out at those who could see the sailboat while he couldn't.
Even with these odd ,scripted conversations he comes off as forced, and if you watch him while another actor is speaking, you can see him physically preparing himself to speak his lines.
I went to college with people like this too - they were usually the ones role playing to dungeons and dragons while smoking hash on a Saturday night with the dead playing in the background.
My suggestion to the producers....try making a documentary about something worth watching next time and hire a different editor and sound person while you are at it.
This film is so over the top that for a while I thought it was a docu-drama spoof in the vein of Blair Witch Project.
The filmmakers do an exceptional job not only of following Wild Man Fischer around and documenting his various moods and behaviors, but they manage to get access to many people who have known or worked with Larry in the past and get their takes on different events (I do wish though that Dr. Demento had been encouraged to sit up for his interview - he reclines on his side with his head propped up for the duration of his interview while duded out in his Dr. D outfit - complete with top hat - it's distracting and makes him look like a pretentious doofus).
The truth of the matter is, it's not -- LA MOUSTACHE is merely a set-up in the most elusive of ways, creeping up on the viewer like the best of the Polanski apartment thrillers (where nothing is as it seems) -- and it sends the hapless Marc (Vincent Lindon) into a world that doubles in on itself one-fold, two-fold, while seeming chillingly normal.
Sparse, deliberate while not being too slow (yet not revealing too much too soon), this is a high-concept thriller that should be seen.
I did notice that one of the reviewers takes issue about the accuracy of this tale, I did see a documentary on the Ames case on the history channel and while it didn`t mention he flew to Geneva thinking it was Zurich ( Yeah this was probably invention ) it did state he did have a severe drink problem and turned up for work in brand new cars , something his colleagues at the CIA never ever noticed - You`ve got to worry why it`s called the Central Intelligence Agency ?
Let Me Explain The Plot: Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming in the local dam.
Or perhaps it is because his wife seems more approving this time while they are happy on vacation.
i always log onto IMDb (while viewing netflix) to see what people think (and to figure out the ending b/c i hate suspense.)
Just witnessing how disturbed each animal is by the twisted turn of events is enough to equally disturb the viewer while also provoking plenty of laughter.
He's the "star" of this odd little picture and while his bio says he was in the Gentrys back in the 60's I seem to remember an album called "Larry Raspberry & the High Steppers" or something to that effect.
I'm well acquainted with both cult movies and the b-movies made out of love for them, but this one truly gets into the spirit of the movies it's homaging while maintaining its own unique approach to the form.
Reality starts when he's sitting in the boat with the red shirt, bearded and eating noodles...  Post card incident is a trick a big trick, its shown him sitting in a hotel window writing to his wife, well if this takes place in his dreams then in reality while he is with his wife later after saying goodbye to their recent friends how could he have the card???
well I agree with most other reviews the key is the hongkongs night lights reflecting from the water, its shown at the beginning then in the middle while he is dreaming and at the end....thus confirming its all his dream...
It's somewhat surprising that The Split is such an obscure film with it's crowd pleasing heist plot & the top drawer cast but it is, last night I saw a full widescreen 2:35:1 Panavision print of this & while the colours were a bit washed out & a bit pastel it looked very nice.
The difference in the case of "La Moustache" is that while this film also happens to lack nice tidy plot lines, the film-makers seemed to think that that, all by itself, makes this film brilliant too.
Lewis Milestone does a reasonable job under the circumstances, directing the movie in a manner as to suggest that he was for a while a student of the avant garde, as there are aspects of this film that seem almost experimental.
Naturalism, my pals, naturalism was often interwoven with melodrama and stridency, in Maugham as in T Williams (--the difference being, naturally, that Maugham was a remarkable writer, while T Williams, a hack--)Âin other words, psychological exploitation, _dramsploitation; RAIN seems a quite peculiar drama, well handled and intelligently crafted, it looks peculiar, striking, unusual, fundamentally exciting and intriguing, with a pretty good pace and sharply devised roles and Mrs. Crawford's particularly raw and convincing performance; and most of all, it has those things, those twinned things we call gusto and brio.
But he really likes RAIN, and Muni ends up sending his stooge, Vince Barnet, to watch the conclusion of the play while Muni and his gang rub out Boris Karloff.
I cannot say that it is the best of all possible adaptations; a tacked-on sub-plot (involving a romance with an amorous quartermaster) helps the exposition but dilutes the icy cynicism of the basic story, the missionary and his wife are clumsy caricatures of hellfire and brimstone puritanism, while Joan Crawford's "low-class" accent is more irritating than it is believable -- one is relieved when she forgets to use it.
The 1976 film featured thirteen-year old Jodie Foster menaced by Martin Sheen while keeping the death of her father secret so she could maintain her independence.
Marc, of course, is getting more & more agitated & Agnes drugs him when he goes to lie down for a while...Marc comes to just in time to hear Agnes & his boss, Bruno, talking about "the men in the white coats" that are coming to take Marc away, and using all his conscience strength to dress himself & make ready, he manages to bolt & impulsively takes a flight to Hong Kong, where he rides the ferries and wanders, eventually taking a room.
They manage to keep up a cover story for teachers and neighbors while their relationship gets even closer.
Jack Clayton's direction is good, if rather literary, the house is a spooky, claustrophobic menace, while the child actors are uniformly excellent.
The story is as follows: the fade in opens with a successful Parisian businessman, Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), shaving off his moustache while having a bath.
Frantic, Marc runs off to find his parents, but is unable to contact them, and calls Agnes to meet him, while watching from a taxi.
Marc lies there for a long while, eyes closed.
This is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together: first, there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him - which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris (while they are both on holiday in China) and second, there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself.
There are a few twists so if you get lost while watching Weakest Link avoid this.
We follow the story of Trevor Blackburn, who may or may not have killed his fiancÃ© while performing a magik ritual.
(To see this, note that the earthly part wakes up from the implantation surgery just before the one nurse says that her shift is over, while the tormented half wakes up two or three seconds later, just after.)
I particularly enjoy the scenes on the train in the US where Holmes determines the location of the various people while Watson acts out who they are.
For some reason Watson was portrayed as even more bumbling than usual, so it's much better to forget about the original in Conan Doyle while the film's on!
All the while Conway's character talking about the sinister wookilar monster, a creature with a pig head.
You have plenty of warning, they are in the crypt for a while before the open the coffin.
The plot itself, while admittedly spoofed, is intriguing, and I didn't expect the ending at all the first time I saw it.
So while AgnÃ¨s leaves the apartment for a short time to do some shopping, Marc takes the risk and cuts off his beloved moustache, just like that, in order to see his lover's face and analyze her reaction when she returns home.
In the first half of the film, while the narrator is explaining how Islam moved through the Middle East and across North Africa, scenes of men mounted on horses or camels are shown riding through desert.
And how there were book stores with hundreds of books in Baghdad while a Christian church in Europe would have been fortunate to have had five parchment books.
This would be exactly like discussing the Soviet and American space programs of the 50's and 60's while dismissing the contribution of German scientists to both programs.
It's unfortunate that no feature length movies have been made because I, for one, would love to know what Sisko learned while moving among the prophets after falling into the fire cave (Final Episode).
Adding Michael Dorn was sheer brilliance on the part of the producers but the loss of Terry Ferral was just brutal (killed off final episode, season before the final season) Marc Alaimo , as Gul Dukat made it east to dislike the Cardassians while Aron Eisenberg made it easy to appreciate the Ferengi!
Battling his own career demons, Sisko must find a way to put the place and its people back together while dealing with more than one race which distrusts Star Fleet's intentions, and - perhaps - along the way he will find some inspiration for staying with Star Fleet despite his numerous and profound misgivings.
Rick Berman and Michael Piller did a great job creating this show and keeping it alive and healthy after Roddenberry's death, while giving a fitting end to The Next Generation.
While all this wasn't very promising and Ginger's performance was VERY broad and "kooky", the film abruptly got worse while she was on a train trip.
And after a while, on a big enough screen this can get really irritating on the eyes!
People were milling casually around or sitting and doing their usual paperwork while the world ended!
Spielberg is truly a great director, and this movie, while not showing every facet of the man's ability, is truly an enjoyable and memorable ride.
We learn that the Phantasm has a very personal motive for killing these mob bosses, as well as a connection to the Joker, which keeps Wayne devoted to his duty for at least a little while longer.
In a flashback to Bruce's college days, we see him meet his old girlfriend Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents' grave.
The first and primary plot focuses on Batman tracking down The Phantasm, a mysterious vigilante who has been systematically killing off mobsters while Batman is blamed.
The movie begins with Batman breaking into a mob runs counterfeiting scheme, Batman deals with the henchman while the boss, Chuckie Sol, makes a beak for it.
The same can be said for Dana Delany who plays the young Andrea Belmont as naÃ¯ve and playful while the older version is more dark and isolated.
The Joker makes Sal laugh to death while getting the Phantasm on tape, and now The Joker knows the true identity of the vigilante.
This is in my humble opinion the second best "Batman" movie next to "Begins" which is number one for me while "Batman (1989)" is number 3, this is one of the best animated movies of all time and truly captures the dark essence of the character from his DC comics roots.
The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand, while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions, and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress.
Even while playing this guessing game, I didn't feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues.
Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn't necessarily a good thing.
Maybe because there isn't one mainstream church that would speak in support of any Klan activity while no Muslim leader that I've heard has condemned Islamic terrorism.
And while this film does not directly deal in the actual war, it does deal in the war against terror, which I am pretty sure are the same.
Samir is a deeply religious man, who wants only to serve God, after being caught while trying to sell detonators to, who we can only call Terrorists, he is sent to prison.
Even less convincing is Samir's ideological disagreement with Fareed while they're having dinner at an outdoor cafÃ©.
I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film.
Those who pick apart this movie are nit-picking because it's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters.
This was evident by the fact that while the movie was playing the audience stayed absolutely quiet.
Neal McDonough is somewhat annoying in a supporting role as Pearce's partner (though I think Neal is annoying anyway...), while Jeff Daniels is a nice addition to the team.
The film seemed slow at times, as I was constantly waiting for a particular moment to happen, while 5 pacing scenes would come in the way like a roadblock and just aggravate me a bit.
Many nations, including the United States, realized that winemaking could be approached using new techniques while still adhering to terroir and tradition.
As for the rest of the cast it seems that the males got the funnier parts, Malkovich is great, Clooney is good (somewhat reminiscent of the character he played in O, Brother), while Frances McDormand could've been funnier (hear name is spot on though).
The chair he secretively builds has a pucking dildo in it that goes up and down as the occupant, I imagine, moves back and forth while seated.
At any rate, it's a great cast, and while the plot might have turned into a dud in somebody else's treatment, the Coen Brothers' writing is hilarious, their zingers deadly.
In the end, as J.K. Simmons character sums it up himself, nothing really happens, but while watching it all unfold, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity.
But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material.
The jokes were hilarious throughout and despite the fact that I seriously thought they would become stale after a while there was always some wacky, juvenile joke around the corner to get me laughing again.
3)People with the wrong company or with larger attention spans will eventually Overdose on the jokes and cease to find the movie funny after a while.
His trip takes him through California and Oregon, where he learned that while his girlfriend was replaced by an android, others that vanished with her on an airplane flight she was on are still human.
Actually, I see from the book review that while the novel was written in 1999, it was set in 2010.
Nice job matching the tone to the original movie while updating the story itself.
All in all, despite obvious issues with Disney sequels, Cinderella III: A Twist in Time brings an interesting plot, more three-dimensional characters, and a little Grimm touch to an undeniable classic - all the while retaining the intimate feeling of hand-drawn cartoons.
The animation, while it looks good overall, is actually horrible upon close inspectionÂso horrible, in fact, that it's absolutely hilarious.
The plot was decent and the animation, while nothing can compare to the original, is decent and colorful as well.I'm sad to say that the second movie actually had better music than this one.
Music is something i really expect from a movie and sadly while slightly entertaining, it did not deliver.
The Fairy Godmother is there as well, and carelessly flings her wand in the bushes while singing.
I love all the Disney fairy tales and while the sequels usually are awful this one was done perfectly!
Director Mike Nichols ("The Graduate") brings to the screen the tragic story of working class hero Karen Silkwood (Meryl Streep), who died under mysterious circumstances while trying to expose shady practices at the Kerr-McGee plant, the Oaklahoma nuclear power plant where she worked.
Meryl Streep is the character, while Julia Roberts is simply playing dress-up.
Because Nichols is never sure whether to focus more attention on Karen's relationships or on her job, and is unwilling to even try to explain the confused circumstances behind Karen Silkwood's death, "Silkwood," while a good showcase for Streep, does not fully work as a film.
), while on the other hand she proves to be a very altruistic and responsible person who does her utmost to protect her unappreciative fellow workers.
Cher is very good as the lesbian room-mate, while Kurt Russel is surprisingly good as the confused boyfriend.
Karen becomes a campaigner for improved safety standards, but is killed in a car crash while driving to meet a journalist to inform him of her suspicions.
Super Metroid did just that: put me in the shoes of a space bounty hunter battling bazillions of aliens while exploring the deepest recesses of creepy alien environments in search of the last Metroid.
The minor warriors wore very little, while the aristocracy dressed up to impress for the occasion with lots of (mainly gold) jewellery and colourful clothes.
It was Col.Holloway, a US intelligence officer, who in fact stole the valuable Venacci Jewelry collection while he was serving with the US Army in Germany back in 1945!
The physical settings only authenticate things, while some films with subtitles can be sometimes awkward, this films' subtitles only make you feel the film more & draw you into the story more.
Once in a while you come across a movie that you might call a gem.
We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those mega-complex theaters, and while everyone was queuing up next-door to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.
Even his parents, who love him very much, while supportive of his decision to live a life of fantasy, don't quite get him.
The writer/director who discussed his movie after the screening at the Ashland Film Festival, said he made this movie based on his own experiences making movies...and while it pays a hilarious tribute to the process of film making I think it goes even deeper.
Wavy Gravy works for a while, then becomes tedious as hell and most of the concert-goers aren't terribly interesting.
the unforgettably hilarious performance of Joe cocker, he seemed to be singing "with a little help from my friends" while impersonating a retarded kid trying to walk on a recently waxed floor with nothing but socks.
Although I've never actually gone to the Woodstock Festival(I'm 22) it seems while watching this documentary you are really there.
To be honest, I was really "watching" it, mainly just listening to it while working, because of the good music shows, but also because I did not realise the original cut was only 3 hours and four minutes, this director's cut version I saw was an extra 48 minutes of footage.
It was a bit surreal back then, and even now to realize that a city of almost half a million people came together for a weekend, enjoyed three days of peace and music, and then disbanded quietly while a nation watched in wonder.
Janis, Jimi, Jerry Garcia and Max Yasgur have passed on, while bands like The Who and CSNY are still capturing the magic for legions of (aging) fans.
I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long.
Every once in a while, you see a movie so dull and so stupid, you have to wonder if drugs were somehow involved in making the film.
It is worth seeing and appreciated for what it has to offer in the present and for the future, while taking in consideration its meager means.
If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.
Denise Richards as Barbara the serial foster mother is a riot, while I didn't even recognise Tara Morice until the credits... but I did enjoy her rendition of "Gold".
Overall, the film was gently over the top, which I feel is the point of mockumentaries, while simultaneously making us feel for the characters.
Like the woman that was raped and killed outside a building while no one did a thing to stop it, or the current gang rape that just happened.
I find it ridiculous that this movie didn't get a good release while the likes of Boogeyman, They, The Unborn, and countless other Asian film remakes did!
This show balances comedy and drama effectively, and maintains a realistic tone while delving into the hackneyed fairy tale scenario of working businesswomen.
Lipstick Jungle, while toned down from Sex and the City, is a great option for those of us missing that show.
And while I'm at it- My Own Worst Enemy is also VERY worth saving- already great and with lots of potential for future story line twists...
The standouts for me amongst the regular cast are Michael Kitchen who is incredibly effective in underplaying his role while still managing to make Foyle a very sympathetic character, and Honeysuckle Weeks who seems perfectly suited to her character.
"Foyle's War" is all about Michael Kitchen as Christopher Foyle, a soft-spoken civilian detective who unravels murder mysteries using his deductive prowess while Britain gears up for WWII.
In the series, it is a provincial town where Deputy Chief Superintendent Foyle tries to solve local crimes of theft and murder, while dealing with wartime problems of black markets, sabotage and espionage.
By today's standards, the plot is predictable and you'll figure out who the killer is early on, but there is till much to enjoy-great black&white photography, neat camera angles, and at least one chilling scene...the blood of the young girl seeping under the door, while her mother and brother stand by helplessly.
The hunt for the leopard begins while more people become victims of a ferocious animal, meanwhile the question arises: Is it really the leopard who is guilty of all those murders?
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
1st movement: Probably the best of the four parts, we begin with Clo-Clo playing her castanets while walking down the street.
It contains two very frightening sequences--one in which a young girl is locked out of her house while the leopard is after her; the other is one of the scariest locked in a cemetary after closing sequences I've ever seen.
To upstage Clo-Clo, Kiki's boyfriend arranges for her to enter the club with a black leopard on a leash while Clo-Clo is performing.
The main storyline revolves around a madman killing young girls while casting the blame on a fugitive leopard...original?
His excessive use of shadows and darkness turns the sets into ominous places while the constant unnatural sounds keep you alert for possible animal-attacks!
The directing is quit poor as well as it tends to jump from one part to another leaving the audience unsure about what is happening while the funny exaggerations of actor's powers are quit overwhelming.
I saw this movie in hopes of having a great Zombie memory but I was very disappointed as there was not storyline just a concept that was repeating it self while the rest of the movie acting, directing, CGI and etc were very poor.
Go see it while you can!
There are shots within the apartment which give "Mulberry St" a claustrophobic dread while outside, there's too much space(..and often a deadening silence on desolate streets with rat-humans eating silently, always listening for sounds of fresh meat) as bodies lie all over the place.
Clutch, however, is more concerned about trying to create a welcome home party for his daughter while Kay in particular seems more concerned about trying to capture the attention of Clutch himself.
"Storytelling" has two parts, and while both are very good, it is somewhat of a pity that the first story was so brief.
Solondz splits the movie in two parts, "Fiction" and "Non-fiction" and shows in both how easily our subjective perception of real life loses its grips in other people's perceptions, situations, expectations... while writing about it.
Mindnumbing bad slasher flick about a killer who's killing off a young film crew while playing a godawful new wave track that goes something like "Boil me!
All the while, the filmmakers intentions become less and less honorable.
However, it gives you plenty of food for thought, and you won't be able to think about anything else for a while.
When Scooby gets to the screening, where various intelligista are gathered, he sees himself on the screen, giving his inner thoughts, while the audience is laughing.
I was never bored, and while it wasn't exactly a "good" time, it moved along as it should, never really too slow or too fast.
He does it again with Storytelling, keeping his impeccable edge while exploring some intriguing new turf.
Unfortunately the plot is the problem, while it is intriguing, an underground city that reaches the end of its life, unfortunately the writer doesn't seem to go very far with it.
The sense of menace is never really there, while the sudden blackouts add a bit of oomph to the movie, apart from that, and a very big mole (don't ask) there never seems a sense of urgency to escaping.
Anyway its Half Term fodder, and while it isn't Potter or Narnia standards this will entertain kids.
Treadway is particularly good, while his character is basically the usual stereotype, a boy who feels he is more than what he really is, who wants to make a difference, goes on a grand adventure.
Her American accent is pitch perfect, and while she isn't as good as she was in Atonement, she still gets the job done.
;)  Love this title, go see it while it is on DVD, because (sadly) it did not do well at all in the box office, so probably no adaptation of "People of Sparks" :(
Overall the movie is nice, but if you have a passion for the sciences you will cringe throughout this movie almost as much as you did while watching The Core (maybe a little less).
Both Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan(the better of the two) give appealing lead performances while Amy/Catherine Quinn is very cute as Lina's little sister Poppy.
One is that while Tim Robbins is a good actor, he is given little to do as Doon's father.
as I could point out the three or four alterations while viewing the film.
I absolutely loved the book when I read it while I was in gradeschool.
); a chick of African persuasion takes a shower and has a jug of battery acid tossed on her causing a stupid melting scene; guy stabbed from underneath a bed while he's having sex (with a girl); uh, I can't think of the rest of the kills.
In the short  while, watch "Laugh In" reruns and prep yourself for a look back  into comedy history.  
Olsen & Johnson go to Universal Studios to film their successor to Hellzapoppin', while everyone at the studio runs for cover.
Brooks played it pretty much as a straight film, while Olsen and Johnson used it as an excuse to do silly things with famous people.
In the short  while, watch "Laugh In" reruns and prep yourself for a look back  into comedy history.  
Cordellini is also very convincing as Hunter's detached and confused daughter, while the rest of the cast remains on a generally satisfactory level.
It never look at my watch a single time while watching it.
The (obvious)plot concerns a group of student stage actors,staging patriotic plays,while plotting to assassinate a known political figure who sides with the Japanese, between 1938 until 1942.
So, I guess while I chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films, I do need to give them some credit for still letting us Americans, who don't mind reading subtitles, view them in their unedited glory.
"Lust" is "sensibility" while "caution" is "sense".
She had the chance to kill Yee while having sex with him but she didn't and she refused to kiss her first love, Kuang.
Men have to caution against lust, while for women, they may have to caution against something else.
All we know about Yee, is that he's a Chinese traitor in the employment of the Japanese, while enjoying immense power under the protection of his master, readily bolts like a running dog that he is in the first signs of trouble.
One, to fulfill her ideology and get rid of possibly one of the most dangerous man to the Chinese, while the other, looking for honest companionship.
It was certainly captivating to watch how this film celebrates Hong Kong's urban identity while also mediating its historical relationship with Shanghai.
Thus, through minimal dialogue and character development, Ang Lee was able to depict Leung's character with great insight and accuracy, all the while reminding us that he was still human on some level.
I have not seen this film for a long time but the middle story stayed with me for a while.
Belle sees through the good looks of the chauvinist Gaston but is terrified at the Beast's appearance (of course, the fact that he locked up her father may be a factor in her fear), and is '90s empowered while being a romantic and a loving daughter.
Despite these flaws, I continue to prize the film while expanding my cinematic understanding by watching many others- I'll one day see the original French version of the story-, and I expect its Disney-style romanticism to keep my burgeoning cynical side in check with each future viewing.
A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's "Aladdin", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times.
So, while not the greatest film in Disney history, it's still one not to be forgotten!
Or maybe what happens is that this movie gets the deserved attention, while others sadly do not have the same luck (such as "The Rescuers", "The Aristocats", "The Fox and the Hound", "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh", "Robin Hood" and others).
All the vocal talent is spot-on, with O'Hara and Benson doing lovely work as the titular characters, while the likes of Angela Lansbury, Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers provide memorable supporting voices.
Likewise, look at Belle and the Beast's snowball fight in 'Something There' while the objects converse.
You also have a cool flash gun that stuns a person for a good while when used.
Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.
This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while "Home Alone 2" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.
Noah, Bruce Spence & Graeme Blundell are superb (with some thanks to flawless script and damn fine direction), while the bit parts played by Robert Carlton (only seen elsewhere in High Tide), are bonzah-funny.
It's really a sitcom-structure that turns out pathetic for a two hour fifteen minutes movie, while it also transforms characters in nothing but cartoon like clichÃ©s.
They had everything, and while I would have loved to go and buy their never recorded collective oeuvre from 1970 on, it's probably best I can't.
Never mind about their timeless music, they even managed to look timeless while everyone else around them in here looked dated by the early '70's.
(Oh, and while I did know of George's argument with Paul over George's guitar playing from an outtake that was used in "The Beatles' Anthology", only Paul's explanation to him about that is in here.)
Paul is like the coach who is up to speed while the players are all out of shape, but he pushes and prods to get them up to speed.
Sung by Paul while the cops were waiting patiently to, what, arrest them?
He spits out lines like "she's gonna have you ARRESTED" like a madman while everybody looks over their shoulders at the men in black helmets.
I have just bought the two volumes of "The Time Tunnel" on DVD and while watching this fantastic episode, I felt like traveling in time to my adolescence when "The Time Tunnel" together with "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" were my favorite shows in the Brazilian black & white television (color TV was introduced in Brazil in 1970, and only years later I could afford to buy one).
And while the movie gets progressively darker and darker, it takes a while for you to realize it because the journey is so fun.
However, once it established the setting and helped the audience come up to speed, the film flowed along nicely (meandering at points but puntucated in the "right spots" with flurries of activity) all the while making good use of real-sounding dialog (in parts it echoed actual conversations I've had).
The story took a little while to start cooking (to continue with a lame metaphor), but when it did, I couldn't stop watching.
Okay, so I only watched the first nine minutes while making something to eat - but it did the trick; I turned it off.
a highly entertaining film...fast paced, lots of action and stunts, and some surprising violence, including a bowling ball head smashing, a woman's head bashed up against a moving trolley, and a crook imapling his face on a fence while running from the cops.
Umberto Lenzi tried his hand at just about every popular type of film in Italy during the sixties, seventies and eighties, and while he has some very nice entries on his list of directorial credits; it has to be said that he isn't the best director to try his hand at the likes of Giallo, zombie and cannibal movies.
Keith has a way of lightening up the news while making important points.
Not a knife had been thrownÂso far") while not mocking it to the point at the movie would lapse into parody and lose its pulpy charms.
Sterling Hayden is sooo out of place while James Mason decides he'll earn his money in spite of what's given him to perform.
Also, while this might disappoint you, most historians don't believe King Arthur ever lived or if he did, the stories about him are all false.
These days the focus (if any) would be on animation, choppy editing, almost no dialog, and the usual/identical musical score: vim, vim, vim, vim on a violin while a chorus belts out wordless chants.
Suppose not while sharks are more and more like teddybears when you watch discovery channel.
The computer graphics did nothing for the film and the producer really didn't think it through, i mean the scale of the shark was just ridiculous and most of the film was in computer graphics i think in total there was bout half an hour that wasn't done by computer.You could only just tell the shark was swimming in the water and it kept blinking while it was "swimming" so since when did fish start to blink, and it was poorly made, i mean come on its the 21st century all the technology there is these days the director and the producer could have made it much better that even the shark in jaws looked more real then the Megolodon did!
There is No Tension & No Action - I was bored out of my mind while watching, but persevered To the end, so I could save others from this dreadful fate by writing this review.
Honest, this movie is 'grates-on-your-nerves-annoying' just like having to stand in a checkout line while someone nearby talks on their cellphone.
Both O'Neill and Saroyan were middlebrow; but while the first was experimental, _avantÂ_guarde, Saroyan was popular and plain, so they're not really alike.
The pace takes a while to get used to but if you're in the mood for something optimistically offbeat, The Time of Your Life should be up your alley!
"The Fly," like "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting.
The Fly is a brilliant commercial horror movie inasmuch as it manages to stay true to the director's vision, while also delivering what audiences expect from a scary movie.
Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as Seth Brundle/ Brundlefly he really shows the true madness of the character while allowing the emotional content to shine through the gaps.
I'm not even really sure why I love this movie, I just think you need a good scare every once in a while and the ending is always a shocker.
There Ronnie and Seth fall for each other and begin an affair while trying to perfect the machines.
It's almost certainly to be worth your while.
Not that it detracts from a nice little comedy-mystery, but this was an even cheaper affair than usual from RKO as they used up a lot of stock rustic Mexican background film to lilting music here while the main characters glided or drove about in front.
Investigation of a painting painted by a dead man (with an art gallery eerily similar to the one in Woman In The Window) leads to murder and theft; the Falcon is chased by the cops while he's chasing the baddies all the way into deepest Mexico.
She also uttered my favourite line from all of the Falcon films Â "My father lived at this inn while he was alive" Â wonderful stuff!
Be prepared though for a Karloff you haven't seen before, all the while I just couldn't get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.
Karloff suffered a back problem that required surgery and thus delayed the film for a while and a central female character called Catharine was jettisoned from the original script.
I've always loved the film and, while I concede that it moves rather slowly, the atmosphere it conjures up is simply marvelous (Jack Mackenzie's cinematography is outstanding) - with the island setting recalling I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943), but given added strangeness by being played out against a backdrop of war.
This is the man who will be trapped and quarantined on an island with a group of travellers and strangers while a plague, or something more sinister, slowly kills each of them off.
This one isn't as well-written as the earlier films in the series, and the isolation, while nicely suggested psychologically, fails to cast the spell of hopelessness and despair it ought to.
Then there's the absurd robbery by an apparently blind man (in clear glasses, so you can see his eyes move and react), and his cohort, and evil little blonde-haired troll, who's NEVER accosted, not once, while walking directly into the power room of the bank.
I'm not even going to get into Samuel and Milla's musical interlude while she has him untied.
The film, while predictable, offers some good moments.
Samuel L Jackson delivers a worthy performance as Jack, adding his signature personality to the role while still maintaining the spirit of the character.
It still burns the hell out of me that Best Buy carries this DVD while Equilibrium was no where to be found.
I thought this movie was fun to watch while at the same time provided plenty of healthy messages for kids/teens without overloading them or taking away from the movie.
When Samson fights Sidqa's forces with the ass's jawbone, he's supposed to slaughter a thousand men, but in this version he dispatches about fifty while Von Sydow and his sidekick watch stiffly in the hammiest fight scene in movie history.
(Then again, on planet Subirax 7G adolescents change far more while they transform into adults.)
Most likely you won't (like John Dillinger) be gunned-down while renting from the video shop, but just for luck why not play it safe and order this one on Netflix.
One boy (Mickey Rooney) is a rough and tumble type, while the other is bookish and thoughtful.
Although it is well acted, I found myself squirming after a while with this narrowly focused film.
Basically, the skeleton of the film from here on end is this, She gets raped, over and over, and over, tries to escape the brothel, The "Main Character" catches her, brings her back to the brothel so she can get raped some more by random horny guys, while he watches from the other side of a glass, Why?
She pretends not to notice him while she talks on her cell phone to her boyfriend.
Her boyfriend arrives while she throws ugly glances at Han-ki.
That title is ironic in the sense that his anti-heroic protagonist really is, whatever we may say or think, or however bestial his behavior, a child of God, while Ki-duk Kim's title "Bad Guy" ("Nabbeun namja") is also ironic in the sense that Han-ki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy, but by naturalistic (or cosmic) standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.
Bad Guy is no exception... while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses.
Also to boot in this classic special is the football kicking episode where Charlie Brown goes to kick the football while Lucy plays him every time for a sucker,which was always entertaining to boot.
Maybe that's not quite the right description but it's the first thing that came to mind while watching it.
A young group of miscreants thieving neighborhood houses while still entertaining those watching the movie with their humorous conversations, and relationships between the trio.
I like to try something new once in a while, and if you're like me, this might be a tasty plate of Futomaki for you!
I learned about this series of Vitaphone shorts while channel surfing...
I guess little Cooper really was a good actor to make us believe the latter while enduring the former.
Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' "Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales.
It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.
I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time.
Norman Wooland plays the wealthy, upstanding young man who courts Todd while she is still carrying on an affair with Desny.
The pivotal scene in which Madeleine's father discovers his daughters affair, while at the same time Madeleine learns of Emile's death shows Lean's dramatic staging at its best.
The odd part is that Grace plays an Australian opera singer with her American accent while Cary Grant plays an American with his English accent.
Things go smoothly for a while in the jungle, but a two legged gigolo decides to have some fun with young and hot looking Lillie.
The pleasure is his desire to hunt and shoot a tiger while in Java.
Garbo is married to an older man, Stone, who neglects her with business duties while on a trip to a tea plantation in Java.
On the basis of sports action, OFF THE BLACK is limited to ONE pitched ball--the TITLE pitch--while THE WRESTLER has many scenes of body-slamming, chair-bashing excitement.
In terms of sex, Nick Nolte's character (Ray Cook) has prostate cancer and presumably the cuddling and kissing he does with his old high school sweetheart Marianne (a thankfully fully-clothed Sally Kirkland) is about all he's up to, while Mickey Rourke's Randy "The Ram" Robinson gets to spend a lot of screen time with topless Marisa Tomei (playing his exotic dancer lover Cassidy).
In regard to substance abuse, Ray pretty much limits himself to a refrigerator full of beer, plus dinner wine and the occasional bottle of whiskey (contributing to the delinquency of a minor through promoting under-aged drinking with his 11th-grader surrogate son Dave Tibbel, played by Trevor Morgan), while The Ram seems to keep his life in shambles through over-medicating himself with every drug known to mankind.
"Poignant" and "bittersweet" aptly describe both films, but the producers of OFF THE BLACK very obviously threw in a few crudities to obtain their desired "R" rating for a movie which could have just as easily been PG13, while THE WRESTLER is definitely a very "hard" R. For what it's worth, I rated the latter story one notch higher than BANG THE UMPIRE SLOWLY, at "9."
The two- Ray and Dave - hit it off and Ray becomes a surrogate dad, while Dave becomes a surrogate son.
Curious combination of cheeky asides and formula bloodshed takes a good while to jell; director Ralph Nelson appears to be attempting a quirky approach, but he doesn't go far enough with his dark-humored take.
and, while it does have a bit more intelligence to it, it's simply not enough and it only hampers the enjoyability of the film.
****SPOILERS FOLLOW******  Add into the mix such criminal plot-holes as her mysteriously being able to vanish at the end, while the person who shot her must clearly be looking directly at her, and I'm sorry but the movie becomes even more of a shambolic hack-job.
This movie is for those who want to use their brain while watching and not only laugh.
4- Finally inside the Groppi Cafe there was a Pepsi refrigerator holding the new Logo of Pepsi which was designed in 1999 while in 1995 there was another Logo !
All characters were obviously very well written as a script , the actors ,all of them gave an outstanding performance, Adel Imam , radiant , witty & funny as ever;Nour el Sheriff made a come back..... it's been a while since I've seen him perform so well on the silver screen; Hend Sabry was lovely; Yousra just Radiant; Esaad Younes more than superb; Ahmed Bedier Wow.... he had the Egyptian Coptic genera nailed to the T; Ahmed Rateb as usual a gr8 performance although the part was too small for such a talent;Khaled Saleh a monster of acting A+ ; Soumaya el khashab a small role but with a lot of soul put into it.
I am worried that this portrayal may help cement some Westerners' anti-Arab view (while I understand that the intention was completely opposite).
now in the age of 65, he's living a lonely life only to enjoy himself with women and girls of different types, finally he found the true love with Bothayna (Hend Sabry) and suffering from the annoying of his half mad sister Dawlat (Essad Youniss) ..  - Haj Azzam (Nour El Seriff): An old tycoon started from zero, wanted to play a politic role but was lost and surrendered in the middle of corruption that rules the game of politics ..  - Taha (Mohamed Emam): a low level young man failed to achieve his dream to become a police officer, instead he joined a radical cell who doesn't really understood the true meaning of the great religion of Islam and became a terrorist and finally died while trying to kill the police officer who once tortured him when he was captured and jailed ..  - Bothayna (Hend Sabry): a poor girl who was forced to become a whore serving the ugliest kinds of people to have the money to live and finally found Zaki El Dissouki who gave her the power and the true meaning of love and finally married him - Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy): A great chief editor in the journal d'Egypt magazine who is living his life as a desperate homosexual and trying to find a guy to satisfy his sick needs and tends ..  A strange mix of characters which were perfectly managed by a strong story and a great and promising director (Marawan Hamed) Really a worthy movie to be seen as it reflects a hard criticism to some corrupted situations of politics, sexual lives and terrorism *** Lo'ay
Khaled Hammad's score was good, but I felt it was overly dramatic in some places (a full Orchsetra playing while 2 people are merely talking?)
Laila Lalani says, "Egypt's young men are easy preys to religious extremism while the country's young women are victims of sexual exploitation."
And I remember the ANXIETY Duryea's character endured; that his telephone -- while waiting for this crucial call -- was going to be disconnected for non-payment.
Two scenes, among many, jump out from the norm for their style, as often happened in a Hitchcock film: Payton throwing coffee, sugar, etc at Cagney, during a spat; and Cagney pushing Carter's foot further on the pedal in a duel of power while she drives her sportscar.
This goes on for a while until one day, while out and about, Eddie witnesses a woman kill her husband.
When our "hero" accidentally witnesses a murder take place and begins fantasizing about the crime-scene, he decides to play private-dick (literally)...   A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is one of those rare 70s era porn films that actually relies on storyline and a bit of decent acting to carry the film, while still maintaing it's grimy porno atmosphere.
The porn scenes are pretty hot, while not really focusing on them as a way to validate the film.
Short, blandly handsome Jason Carns, a seemingly ordinary and unassuming nice guy next door type gone horribly bug crazy wrong, gives a frightfully plausible performance as lowly security guard Eddie, who gets his twisted deviant carnal kicks by pretending to be a Los Angeles police officer who joyfully browbeats, manhandles and elicits unpaid sexual favors from street hookers while wearing a fuzzball uniform and driving around in a phony cop car.
Rosamund John provides effective support as loyal wife Diana, despite the absence of conflict between them to provide a cheap motor for their scenes together (particularly memorable is a scene in the kitchen where Diana has to reinforce her husband's faltering resolution to maintain his integrity at the cost of his employment... while trying to get him to chop the parsley!)
Script writer and ubiquitous character actor Miles Malleson can be glimpsed in a typical cameo role, and David Niven, while always entertaining, shades his character towards maturity while representing a whole generation of ex-WWI flyers who found themselves cast adrift at the end of hostilities.
In the Battle of Britain (fought in the summer of 1940) the Royal Air Force deployed the Hurricanes against bombers, while the more agile Spitfires engaged their fighter escorts.
If the bell went to scramble, filming would temporarily be halted while those airmen would run to their spitfires, go off and fight the war, before returning and carry on filming as though nothing had happened.
Few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair.
they are similar however... enough for me to know most of what was being said after watching the movie for a while.
for a while after i saw the movie i looked to buy it.
The film delivers it's story with a soft touch, avoiding extremes while maintaining an earnest sense of legitimacy.
In my opinion, conspiracy theorist start off with an advantage, because while the adherents to the official version of events must PROVE their claims, the conspiracy theorists don't - they succeed when they manage to create enough doubt about the official version of events.
Other things such as the gold under the WTC and the faked phonecalls are just ridiculous and makes me wonder what they were smoking while making this film.
The stupid message aside, even the technical aspects are not that impressive, the graphics are pretty ugly, the music dull and even the speaker voice gets pretty annoying after a while.
It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication.
Video and film allow vast numbers of our citizenry to gather around our intentions while discovering the best or worst of our nation.
Now, had the film makers gone for 'camp' and spun it, Decoys could have been one of those films you kept on your self and pulled it out for a good chuckle once in a while (Army of Darkness, Arena, Robojox... You get the picture).
So while the blending of the sex comedy genre that has been bludgeoned to death in Hollywood with the monster mash genre that seems to have overridden science fiction looks good on paper, it requires a few things at the execution stage in order to work.
Instead, we are simply given more scenes in which sex and death are equated, while a level of misogyny rarely seen outside of America is on display.
The excessive stupidness of some of the college students got a bit annoying after a while.
Decoys is set on St. John's College campus in New Brunswick in Canada where Luke (Corey Sevier) & his roommate Roger (Elias Toufexis) are two students just trying to have a good time, while trying to return some loose change to blonde babes Lilly (Stefanie von Pfetten) & her roommate Constance (Kim Poirier) Luke witnesses something strange & terrifying, the two female roommates are in fact aliens.
Decoys is a film that seems to have provoked a fairly mixed reception, some seem to like it while just as many don't.
A sequel Decoys 2: Alien Seduction (2007) went straight-to-video & while I haven't seen it it's meant to be terrible.
She gets quite a bit of screen time while not actually being the lead, you might also recognize her from the Dawn of the Dead remake, she's got quite a memorable scene in that one!
Unfortunately, these delectable intergalactic honeys cause men to freeze from the inside out while having sex with them.
Stefanie von Pfetten is a scream queen gift to the masses -- one I need to catch up on -- and the movie, while not awesome, combines horror and humor elements to good effect.
OK, the reason they called this movie "Hush", is so that you would be quiet in the theater while everyone was sleeping.
It looks like they made that up while they were filming the movie.
This movie is one of the best suspense movies that I've seen in a while.
Without him, they would never have become the people they are, so to see them end up with nothing, while he is still rich isn't satisfactory at all.
Unfortunately, while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash, the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today.
First, it's hard to imagine the Nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the US while we are at war with them!
Plus, while March works on top-secret military plans, he does a lousy job of securing them so Emil isn't able to steal them.
I mean: the fact that I remembered some of the lines from watching it a couple of years ago, while I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday, speaks for itself.
For a while Emil does get his classmates to go along with his crazy antics that he picked up back in Germany while in the Hitler Youth.
Emil has his classmates take night marches into enemy territory and staging roadside ambushes, all in fun of course, while being disguised in camouflage so that the enemy, whoever he is, can't see them as well as familiarizing themselves with all kinds of arms and ammunitions, German of course.
He was just like a Bond-villain after a while, even with the idiotic laughter and everything.
How teenage dreck is released into theaters while brilliance is shoved into a videobox with a generic skull on it is anyone's guess.
Scream made it okay to be clever as opposed to scary, and while that's okay, some recent movies have felt more like an x-rated version of Lizzie Macguire than a slasher.
This is the first lighthouse type movie I have ever seen, and I think it will remain the best for a while (in my perspective!).
The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s).
An anal movie-buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition -- while Palace Girl is the "literal" translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady).
Thorpe's IVANHOE is a typical epic of the classic Hollywood era while Camfield's IVANHOE stands out on its own as a movie filled with remarkable psychology and adventure.
In fact, while the book/film is called "Ivanhoe", the interesting parts are the dynamics between Brian Guilbert and Rebecca, or between James Mason and John Rhys-Davies (classic!).
Every New YearÂ´s Day the last twenty years public service television have showned this movie in the afternoon, the perfect time for dragging yourself up, buying a pizza and maybe forget your extreme hangover for a while.
In the middle of it all, the dates try to compose themselves while the other couple are ready for combat at each other.
In the end of their first date, the younger couple sit in the first seat while the older couple reunite the passion.
Lawrence plays a struggling writer while Keller plays a caterer.
Thrill as Butt Chin, who crashes a car while escaping a GenCorp truck (Note: Where did J.K. manage to get such an army, anyway?
The movie continues with our hero trying to stop said corporation, romancing the girl, "engulfing her" with his chin-butt, getting unpresentably filthy on many occasions, doing irreparable damage to the space-time continuum, dying while unpresentably filthy, and allowing his alternate temporal self to continue this tradition.
If the makers of this film have been around for a while you should probably stop.
And while the movie is bad, it's not as bad as a lot of the stuff they showed.
So, while I give the movie a 3/10, I'll give it a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
