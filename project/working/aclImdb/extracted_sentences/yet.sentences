I never liked too much Day, cause of her image too `goodie goodie' yet she proves to be a good actress here.
Cagney is great as the controlling and abusive hoodlum and paints him with most unflattering strokes, yet generates a bit of sympathy because he is so pathetic as he clings to Day in desperation.
It is the greatest musical Doris Day was ever involved with, yet it doesn't seem to command the same devotion as 'Calamity Jane', an entertaining but unsatisfying comic romp, or even the lumpen 'Moonlight' movies.
He's a monster, yet one who becomes increasingly sympathetic as the nature of his failings becomes apparent.
It certainly doesn't dilute the strength of her performance, or the character for that matter, and knowing that it wasn't considered socially proper for a woman to talk back to her fella in those days adds yet another layer of complexity to the fabric of this union.
Doris Day's portrayed Ruth as a sexy and sassy performer and sung with a strong, jazzy, bluesy voice, when I saw the real Ruth perform in the movies and in 2 shorts, she wasn't sexy and sassy, she was reserved, the type of performer to stand still and sing with great emotion and feeling, she wasn't the wiggling hips type like Doris Day portrayed and Ruth's voice was so light, airy, powerful without being loud and aggressive, you don't hear the blues, jazz in Ruth's voice yet she was a torch singer.
Doris is very curvy and plump in this movie, she looks tough and looks like she could let the limping Cagney have it and run so he couldn't catch her yet Doris portrays Ruth as weak, so it makes me wonder what the real Ruth Etting was really like, the real Ruth looks so frail and innocent, she looks as though you could knock her over with a feather but I hear she was tougher than Doris portrayed her but I guess the movie was more interesting portrayed Ruth as naive and gullible.
She was quite unique and powerful yet with a little voice and a little body but you believed everything she singed, her adorable face and presence would naturally make you feel her pain, behind the pretty face that was a lot of hurt that was obvious through her singing.
But to also find her an accomplished actress of the melodrama is quite astonishing, since Day is often known as the fluffy powder puff of feather weight musical tripe, or, the squeaky clean, yet strangely asexual appendage of Rock Hudson.
While he was cruel, vile, despicable, certainly repulsive and yet you felt at the same time he was pitiful, sad, pathetic.
The way the film is sculpted leaves only the most essential scenes on the screen, which at the end resonate with each other and become vital like peaces in a thrilling yet dark puzzle.
If ever death truly became her, Zemeckis has found the right wardrobe yet.
While Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep play great opposite roles as the two jealous fighting women who fight over differences and yet have to live together inspite of it.
There are no special effects, yet the story is quite riveting.
Sadly, the only as yet released version of this film is a 12 year old VHS tape put out at SLP speed to boot!
You're wrong, but you won't know it yet.
the Both central male figures are worth close analysis- Mitchum claims to love and appreciate Rachel more than Holden's character, yet he too only thinks of Rachel in monetary terms when he offers to 'buy' Rachel from Holden.
It's simple, yet powerful themes and efficient running length mean that the film does not stray into long-winded sequences that detract from the original premise of Rachel's struggle as a 'replacement bride'.
He hasn't gotten over the death of his wife yet and can't love Young, but with Mitchum's arrival he starts to get jealous!
It seems to be the UK version I saw, yet some accents were American.
Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.
And yet many spiritual and wonderful things about the native culture come through without question.
He falls in love with a beautiful and very young Indian chief's daughter, and tries to join their group -- and yet he also understands the priest, and is attracted to his spirituality.
The lack of Hollywood stereotypes and minimalist dialogue help make the characters seem more real, making the climax subtle, yet surprisingly powerful.
Both cultures are seen as slightly insane world-views that are, ironically, valid in their own way, yet futile at the end of the day.
And yet, Moore has so successfully replicated the brutish world of the Native American that the viewer who can overcome modern Political Correctness will indeed find himself wishing not for their destruction but that they and their enemies could, in one sense, cease to be Huron, cease to be Iroquois, for their own sake and for each other's, before it is too late!
Melchett returns, as a stark raving mad superior, adopting the obnoxious, loud behavior of Laurie, and the two, individually or, better yet, together, lead to many an eye-rolling, funny and memorable moment.
Blackadder goes Forth is pure genius, tinged with sadness- on this occasion Blackadder is yet again obnoxious, ruthless and selfish, but in the aim of doing something we can understand- escaping the trenches of WWI.
His character is lonely but yet a naive and caring individual as he finds an ill pregnant woman (Olga Bellin) while working on a farm as a caretaker.
Everything is tied in together nicely, making a great, yet sad ending.
Slowly yet surely you find out exactly what has happened in that mansion.
Part of this is deliberate, as their past frustration undoubtedly feeds their current boredom and anger, yet one feels that much of the same ground could have been covered by some relevant interaction between the four, who leave their personal demons resolutely undiscussed.
Nina Siemaszko portrays of young "virgin", who is lonely, innocent and vulnerable, yet strong willed and independent, with higher moral values.
He's probably the ultimate Hollywood goody two-shoes and yet here his performance leaves you wondering whether the father is a good-guy faced with a gut wrenching decision, or a bad-guy simply contemplating an evil one.
It's sad and yet funny.
If you've seen the series, yet not the TV pilot, Jim left San Francisco on the Harley Sportster vacated by his friend Nick's suicide.
Not yet a star, Clark Gable is very effective as a menacing chauffeur.
Don Mitchell's episodic, yet coherent script conveys a series of vividly realized, colorful and engrossing vignettes with topmost clarity and acuity, perceptively nailing the rampant hedonism, moral permissiveness, Nixon-era unease and paranoia, corrupting and erosion of flower child ideals, mass disillusionment, and intense spiritual malaise which defined the early 70's.
A surprising change of pace for (up to that stage in his directorial career) shock auteur FranÃ§ois Ozon in the wake of bourgeois facade-ripping as REGARDE LA MER and SITCOM, this minimalist masterpiece deals with love, loss and grief yet never becomes heavy-handed.
One could say that the wisdom of 'Tokyo Cowboy' is a bit simple and obvious, yet these themes one cannot discuss and dwell over enough.
In Under the Sand there is nothing else to do and yet it's exactly what Rampling in her role has to do: think and dwell.
I believe at the end of the movie we are shown that she will continue to refuse to relinquish the past, yet, invariably, it is shown to her that she must go on, embracing the present, as must we all.
She communicates the spectrum of feelings of this challenged strong woman with her eyes, her gazes in the mirror, her interaction with her class of students, her friends, her admirer with such power that makes her Marie a wholly credible creature stricken by loss yet surviving in her chosen manner.
Boy, I must either be really bored or completely out of other material to watch because it's generally known that Miss Delaney has yet to deliver a decent film.
Here she plays a complex women who is supposed to be smart and yet at the same time very dumb.
It is political correctness taken to the most irrational yet predictable extreme.
When I watched it I consciously knew that it was the same words being spoken but then yet I did not understand why I felt sympathy for one character but not for the other speaking the same words.
Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a Dutch the leader of a commando unit who must take on a sneaky kill crazy creature who skins his prey and uses their skulls as trophies in this bloody yet well made monster movie which starts of slow but becomes so engrossing and suspenseful you feel drained near the end.
However, I certainly give all the props in the world to the kids who can stomach Paul and his despicable actions, and yet come out of it with a great talent.
And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film.
Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously.
I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.
Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar, including Predator, and yet this film is so much better than most of the others.
The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance.
I should perhaps also give some praise to Buscemi for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want : Tommy want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , Tommy wants to take a woman he`s picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear .
This semi-biographical tale centres around a down on his luck, yet charismatic bar fly, set on his way to self destruction.
The best thing about this film is how it ridicules film-making and yet somehow is a good example of artistic pompousness.
This is a movie which manages to portray the consequences of modern day war on people's lives with a degree of realism that I have yet to see in most other films of the genre - one possible exception being Kubrick's Apocalypse Now.
Savior is one of the most horrifying, yet wonderfully made movie I have ever seen!
A tale played out over and over in human history, yet we still have not learned our lesson.
But as Quaid finds out, his allies can be scummier than his foes; this is the setup of "Savior," wherein Quaid redeems his humanity to save a helpless baby, yet another victim of the nameless war.
It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy.
The plot is great, picking up where the last one left off, confirming which of the endings they used, and taking you through one place that had yet to be visited in these three...
Maybe it helps to restrict the budget and what you have here is an interesting example of something between indie and full blown Hollywood feature that relies on performances, script and directive skill rather than throwing cash at a slim idea to make yet another bland effects fest.
The second category is where Slipstream fits into: meant to be original, innovative and artful yet all you get is mere pretentious junk.
I highly recommend getting the seasons on DVD ( Seasons 1,2 and3.. 4 and 5 are not available yet) Long live Reno Raines!
Hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet.
It's impossible not to think about my own father seeing his personage, with this overwhelming love for his son and yet unable to communicate with.
It's the nearest you will get to understand fatherly love if you don't yet have a baby.
One of Bette's best roles, too bad is not available on vhs/dvd yet.
Everyone claiming that the Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now are brilliant, yet everything else is "An example of an egomaniac not having objectivity."
Coppola has tried so hard throughout his career to "reject Hollywood" - and Hollywood has, in turn, often rejected him - yet he makes a truly gorgeous paean to Hollywood production values here.
One thing I can't figure out is the other reviewers of this film that are watching the DVD copy after seeing it on video, yet none of them seem to notice the difference.
The final walk of the duo is an ordinary event yet captured powerfully in this film.
The film succeeds because of low-keyed acting (Merhar and Miou-Miou), the sombre yet mesmerising music and good mise-en-scene.
Here we have yet another Hollywood butchering of science fiction.
THE STAIRCASE is protracted and meticulous, yet a fascinating study of how a 'Dream Team' legal defense is organized and executed.
I have yet to get tired of this movie.
It's non-stop, yet stylistic.
Also, watch for some film footage showing an assembly of Communists who are desperate to show their devotion to Stalin--it is a small yet clear example of the absurd level which Communist totalitarianism reached.
He's great, the modern day "stone-face" scores yet again!
Dana Carvey is an extremely talented comedian,which makes it a shame that his efforts since his Saturday Night Live days have fallen,at least for the most part,miserably flat.The latest effort,The Master of Disguise,is no exception.This film is horrid from top to bottom.It is a poor execution of what was a poor story idea to begin with.Executive Producer Adam Sandler's ideas about comedy may work when Sandler himself is in the film,but he has yet to produce a good effort when solely behind the camera.Carvey's efforts to make this a good film are indeed valiant,but he can't do it alone.Even the character names (Pistachio Disguisey?)
If you haven't seen it yet, it's probably best you keep it that way.
His blend of personal, yet universal issues and crude (in your face) treatment with wild, creative imagination is not ordinary fare.
It was too amateurish and hokey and didn't match the overall dark yet slick feel of the film.
Overall, Pandora's Paradox is a solid yet bizarre film combining Lynch and Argento with Matt's own twisted ideas.
Of course, evil step-dad tells Derek all about it and remarks, "you ain't tapped that yet?"
The cinematography is quite ahead of its time (the camera rarely sits still, yet remains unobtrusive), the drama is milked for maximum effect (and there are numerous sudden shocks), and the science-fiction/occult aspects of the film never overshadow the human element.
Some may not get it, but for the ones with a brilliant eye for comedy and attention to detail, this in my books has yet to be beat.
However, the way this show is acted, written and produced is, for me the best, the most observant, yet ridiculous, that I have ever seen on British comedy television.
This film, which provides equal importance to hens and donkeys as it does to human characters, is as real as they come and yet so removed from the values of Hollywood's screenplays, then and now.
Steiger is subtle yet everything he does that is in any way connected to escaping his dumb captors is hilarious: the way he touches the soldier's rifle, the manner in which he dashes away with the cow bell attached to his neck... Priceless.
i think it amazing that a film from the 80's can please a 20 month old baby it amazed me and my family and i hope he will continue to like it a long time yet
-Ren mentions his love for "Men at Work" and "The Police", yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock.
A film based on the same old story that follows the same old lines yet somehow manages to make you enjoy.
He has a daughter named Ariel (Lori Singer) who is basically a hell-raiser--yet loves her father.
This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score.
Burns stories that he wrote were comical, yet exciting at the same time.
Similar, yet different, from his other films ("The Brother's McMullen" and `She's the One'), writer/director/producer/actor Edward Burns, with his typical minuscule budget, broaches on Woody Allen territory this time as he explores the ooohs, aaahs and owwwws (mostly the owwwws) of the marriage and dating game.
I found this distracting wondering throughout the show if there may have been a dispute and he refused to come on or, worse yet, he was suffering from some deadly disease!
I am yet to see anything on the small screen which comes close to them.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who is not out of the closet yet or is already out.
If you have not yet seen this movie, find it and watch it.
The film "Maurice" (1987) took place in 1910 and the repression was worse and yet that film had a much more positive ending.
The two main characters of this film struggle to maintain a relationship, because they are in love - yet ultimately the homophobic attitudes of the world force them to part.
Tragic, yet it is a tale that plays itself out in every little town on the globe.
There were a couple of other good jokes I liked as well, like the guy that could not get a girl yet he looked like the type of guy girls chase after.
You will not find a more weird film and yet I admit some of this went a long way, just not enough to be worth putting money down on.
The sex farce is played like Feydeau and yet is handled deftly enough to allow one to take one's older children without squirming on anyone's part.
Where is the emotion of two people falling in love, yet not trusting each other?
I managed to get nine of these films via ebay at extremely good bargain basement prices so you could check out all ten and even get the ones that I have not seen yet and these are Treacherous Beauties and At the Midnight Hour.
I always wonder when actors turn to films they must know are bad going in, and yet still are part of them!
Hell the General was the great bad guy (The Cigarette Smoking Man in the X-files for many years) and yet he chose to do this ridiculous obviously cheap film anyway.
She's crude, classless, unlikeable, a filthy slob, a drunk and a disgusting chain-smoker, yet this handsome, wealthy,young, successful, opera-loving, and impeccably neat "catch" falls hopelessly in love with her.
If you haven't seen it yet you need to because it is just wonderful.
I heard that this is actually a sequel to amovie called "Scared to death", which I haven't seen... yet.
It's yet another "Alien" rip-off created in the early 1990s when rubber monster suits became more affordable.
It is often said that these early Lumiere shorts are primitive because they have not yet mastered basic film grammar, such as camera movement, editing or the close-up, films like these being a simple, static set-u;, the camera pointing at the scene from a middle distance.
(SPOILER ALERT:How come Eve cannot read a Menu OR a computer screen, yet apparently CAN read ingredients on packages when trying to make a cake..with hilarious results...and THEN again is not able to read "The Book" ???)
The plot IS original yet simple.
Director Michael Schultz is legendary and yet this might be the problem: his style is a little dated and isn't as edgy as some of the more modern films of our times.
I have yet to see a film with such heart.
Basically, this movie is absurd, yet hilarious.
Kusturica, given a part that begs overacting, never wrings out our emotions, yet shows he possesses true remorse for his actions and a heart kinder still than that of his benefactors.
It's a simple yet gripping film with an intriguing plot, almost a morality play.
Patrice Leconte has directed with panache as he takes us to see the beauty of Saint Pierre, something that is so bleak, yet it's a place that has a magnetic attraction as we watch the film unfold.
Santhosh has proved yet again why he is the best cinematographer in India.
Other commendable performances should go to Suraj Balaji, whom portrayed the cute, innocent yet brave little younger brother of Kaurwaki.
I have yet to see a Bollywood film with comparable dance scenes (I love dancing along to "O Re Kanche") and unforgettable music.
A warrior is born who fights many battles yet it is quickly established that this young man is very much fighting human wars, quenching a thirst for power and balancing this with his love for his family, particularly his mother.
In some sequences the camera cuts like a sword with flashes of residue left lingering both on screen and in the viewer's mind, yet in others following, he uses less shots and still manages to maintain rhythm.
The film is fantastic and yet some of the parts really shouldn't add up to something so good.
The very idea of prostituting a girl that young is sickening yet 13 year old Georgia Groome stands alone as the disillusioned runaway.
The setting itself is grim but it was the conversation that made me squirm, asking a young girl not yet a teenager weather she is virgin is or is not a virgin made tense uncomfortable viewing, her innocents shining through by the fact she appeared to be unaware of what was being said.
The movie looks suitably "everyday" and yet not ugly despite the subject matter.
They're a thirty-something whore with bruises and an inflamed black eye and a frightened runaway not yet twelve with melting makeup whom Kelly found at Waterloo Station for her spineless pimp Derek (Johnny Harris), to please a pedophile gangster named Duncan Allen (Alexander Morton).
It's not exactly a formula, yet, this kind of abuse in your living room, but I think it will be.
This film contains prostitutes, paedophiles, drugs, and violence, yet to even think that this film panders to genre stereotypes would be doing it an injustice.
Better yet, they truly emote.
Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR  The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR  The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts  The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start  The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times  Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR  Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi  Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
And yet another silly scene, involving our blessed Irishman of the cloth, is when he gives one of his grandiose speeches to our hero in a plane about belief in God, and the weather suddenly improves.
I wanted so much to see the film especially because of Monic Hendrickx, but the film was not subtitled yet for English.
By the way, try reading up on co-star Marie McDonald--her IMDb profile is bizarre yet fascinating.
She's a smart, sharp, yet somewhat clumsy lady lawyer--being nominated for judgeship--whose career may be hindered by her association with Cummings, the no-goodnik ex-husband still in love with her.
Thirdly, you are correct that the OFFICIAL Dutch resistance was not yet organised, but the resistance fighters in the story are early volunteers who are trying to hamper the German occupation of Amsterdam, and will no doubt form the nucleus of the resistance movement that would soon follow.
It's always difficult when you want to shake off the past, but yet get haunted by its ghost.
There were ample potential ones like the uneventful searches, the longing, the loss, but they were all building up the emotions to that one scene near the end, where you really feel the love lost, of being so close yet so far, the longing feeling to hold your loved one in your arms, to embrace them in warmth, to keep them safe from harm and to shower them with your love.
Overall, one of the best D&D movies yet, although Serenity is pretty close (and it's sci-fi!)
I watched it last night even though it has not been released yet (it plays on the Sci Fi channel on Oct 8th) and well... it was great!
The special effects are among the best I've ever seen in a non-theatrical film and are leaps and bounds above any other Sci-Fi premier yet broadcast (Though not quite as good as a theatrical release).
Also, Johnny's character of Bruce has lived in the United States since childhood, having immersed himself in American culture for many years, yet he comes-off as a confused tourist who is in the states for the first time?
The acting was atrocious, yet the film was strangely compelling -- as compelling as watching a car crash.
I just kept watching and watching, appalled yet fascinated.
Johnny Yune stars in this rather unhumorous yet abundantly silly comedy spoof of Martial Arts films.
As an Asian American, Yune cannot live up to the macho Asian image yet is rejected (possibly as a threat) by the so called "real" white Americans.
The Olympic games and the need for love are parallel stories in the film which we all understand, and yet are not melodramatic.
This has never happened in this cinema yet.
"The Man" is yet another lame PG-13 comedy.
This is Director Mikheil Kalatozishvili's tribute to Sergei Eisenstein, a disorienting yet organized montage of vast scale juxtaposed with claustrophobic confinement (its worth watching again just to focus on the scene transitions-the editing is brilliant).
She resents the good people of King's Bay capitalizing on the disaster, yet she has no misgivings whatever in playing on Amundsen's sense of guilt to get him to mount a rescue attempt.
Writer/director Richard Tuggle relates the compellingly sordid plot at a gradual, yet steady pace, develops a good deal of tension, delivers a vivid and intriguing evocation of the seamy Big Easy red light district, and, most of all, offers a strong and provocative exploration of the extremely warped and disturbing aspects of severely aberrant male sexuality and perversity (for example, Block likes to handcuff woman while making love to them in order to have a sense of control).
Professional and yet yielding to prostitutes a little too easily and too often, and forgetting his ties on the place of intercourse.
On one hand, he's a wonderfully loving father of two sweet girls (one played by his actual daughter, and played well), and yet he is a weak man when it comes to prostitutes.
Some may find God in silence but if you haven't found God yet, you are unlikely to find the Supreme Being sitting comfortably in a cinema seat for three excruciatingly boring hours.
He structures the film in an unscathed and natural way, both accurately capturing the monks' daily routines yet also flowing by seasons.
Each season has its own pleasures, which range from the playful walks of the monks in spring and summer to the moody yet harmonious mise-en-scene of the winter.
It is after this, however, that the film resembles true life itself: rarely have documentaries portrayed such an unhurried sense of time, yet all of the film passes faster than you wish it to, each minute counting to the very last.
GrÃ¶ning's masterful shots of the Grand Chartreuse are let alone one reason that elates the film, yet more than a placed and planned camera, the shots almost resemble spying.
Nevertheless, GrÃ¶ning has created a film of its kind: the type that will keep you thinking and enjoying its quiet pleasuresÂonly through simple imagesÂfor a long time, yet also one that could gratify film lovers without a limit to its quiet sense of aptness.
Are you laughing yet?
The chemistry between the two seems natural yet in reality very forced.
If you have not seen it yet then by all means rent it..............My comments are not the minimum length for comments of ten lines of text so I will add some more.
The screenplay by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum (utilizing original stories from several talented writers, including Dan O'Bannon) may intrigue youthful audiences, yet these plots fail to pop and the thing seems to last a lifetime.
Another thing you may soon notice is that although this film managed to get an R-rating, it is incredibly explicit--yet somehow this got the R and FRITZ THE CAT got an X.
The most fun film yet... relax charlie...i got an angle
It's a adult-oriented yet approached in a very immature manner.
I wasn't even five years old when it premiered on ABC, yet I can vividly recall the theme song.
They were so mismatched and from totally different backgrounds, and yet they worked so well together.
Jeff Goldblum was wonderfully befuddled, yet earnest in a most endearing way.
Elijah does everything right by staying out of trouble, going to school, etc., and yet he still gets the shaft.
Sen displays both coolness and a pinch of arrogance while playing the strong politician, yet convincingly switches it with warmth and cordiality when she becomes a suffering woman or a wife.
They claim to be 'Christian', yet they deny what their own Bible teaches them.
In this case, a little too much footage is devoted to the side story of a couple of other male leads who are at odds with one another yet manage to also enlist in the army along with Bud and Lou.
Come to think of it, the funniest part yet about "Surf II" was... there was never a "Surf I".
Jack Cardiff was the director of photography, Anthony Powell, the costume designer, Nino Rota composed the score, Anthony Shaffer signed the screenplay and the list goes on and on and I haven't even mention the cast yet.
Watch the premium cable version, or better yet rent (or buy!)
I haven't seen anything else by him yet than this, THE LONGEST NITE (1997), but his other works include The Odd One Dies and Expect the Unexpected, which have also been hailed by HK fanatics and specialists.
Tony is a wonderful actor with smooth and kind face, yet his character here is anything but nice or kind.
I have seen this twice now and still there are elements which I cannot yet explain, but they're not so important as the things this film gives and has are already visible to me.
If you haven't seen this film yet, dig up a copy from somewhere, get a few beers and prepare to be captivated from beginning to end.
They're at different points of their lives, yet trying to find their common ground.
The names of Michael Ironside, Michael Madsen and Oliver Gruner are displayed in big letters on the front-cover of the DVD, yet they only have supporting rolls in this flick.
I have so many old friends who i keep in touch with and miss, yet when we're together it's obvious how different we all are now.
Creative and rightfully epic, yet familiar, prompting a sense of nostalgia rarely obtained by indy films.
If you liked "An Inconvenient Truth", you will be enthralled by this equally important yet superior film.
And I don't think anybody has made a strong enough point of this yet: when Irene is lying there in the bed there, man, she is HOT!
Grant, plays a fairly unsympathetic character, yet remains charming as hell.
The witty `doublespeak' dialog at the end was fascinating as each of these protagonists explained the situation in self-contradictory fashions and yet their meanings were unmistakable.
It's always instructive to watch films released no more than a year apart, tackling an identical subject, with many ideas in common, yet made in different countries and causally unrelated: take Australia's "Better Than Sex", and France's "A Pornographic Affair".
"Better Than Sex" is yet another mostly bedroom two-hander on a relationship, like "About Last Night" and "Breaking Up," but is quite charmingly done in a frank and funny tone.
At one point one character says "We've already had our first fight," which hadn't happened yet, and he leaves with a bag he hadn't brought over.
From the initial meetings to the scared first steps, the initial sex to the first words the next day, the progression of knowing nothing to seeing the unfolding of a relationship not yet defined and blossoming.
Here two people say what they mean and mean what they say, and what they don't say they don't say because they're not sure yet that they feel it.
It's a paradox, because the filmmakers definitely want the viewer to like Dennis Quaid's character the most, yet there's little effort in developing him outside of his professional life.
if you notice when he's talking to Quaid in the car and Quaids just talking about being around and thanks him and his partner makes a face and says "Dont thank me yet" ..very subtle clue that goes thru one ear and out the other of most but once i heard it i knew he was either involved or was gonna be killed pretty soon, i was sure he was involved and just as i suspected he was.
I think it would be best to classify it as an experimental curio - one of those films like "Eraserhead", Jacques Tati's "Playtime", "Cabinet of Dr. Caligaryi", or "El Topo", which have no conventional film equivalent yet continue to garner a following from a small group of adventurous filmgoers.
Anyway the discussion leads to another discussion about shop with the basketball coach, who states that shop never helped him, yet it did since he now has a ready made hobby of building giant recipe card boxes.
In New York she would have been directing a real estate emporium or huge corporate conglomerate, maybe both, where Rafi could have just looked good in the publicity ads as she ruled ruthlessly; yet in time she would have done the charity balls, she would have even sponsored some cultural causes, eventually she would have been perceived as a pillar of society.
Trog, a prehistoric giant who "is as frightened of us as we of him," as Malanthius sweetly remarks, is a direct ancestor of Shrek, and looks frightening yet endearing.
This battle is unusually gruesome, and absurd, yet an exciting delight to watch as both her and Sinbad are endangered by falling ice spears.
The script by Beverly Cross & producer/special effects man Ray Harryhausen has a simple yet functional story, it has a villain, plenty of monsters & mythical creatures, exotic locations, action scenes, sword fights, black magic & a chess playing Baboon, what more do you want?
i completely disagree with the posted review i usually give people the benefit of the doubt but this movie is quite funny and i think the usage of different movie mediums (ie animation, documentary)added a very cute yet thoughtful comedic value.
Besson makes no attempts to sacrifice his film in the ways of Hollywood convention, and he proves that the days of female-driven action cinema are not yet dead.
Directer Lee still hasn't fully gained a strong grasp of storytelling yet as a director at this point as the film as it's sometimes difficult to make out why anything's happening in the film, but the potential shows as well, with honest characters and patient development.
He stabs him, dump snakes on him, and worse yet, annoys Sing all the time.
In my opinion this is the best Chinese comedy kung fu movie yet to be made.
If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything else about it - just GO so you can experience it for yourself without anybody's opinions coloring your judgment.
In fact, I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet.
Devil's Prey is not a high budget movie, yet still there are thrills and twists which I enjoyed watching.
I found the ending to be hopeful, and I appreciated how the child who sat on the porch with his dad and uncle DID have a real person's name, yet was at once "boy, kid, son."
This film is not an action movie like the title might imply, far from in in fact, it is slow moving yet relentless in it's growing tension.
In general, the story focuses on the hostility and ugliness of human nature yet without being obnoxious or judgmental.
It was sad to see how most were earnestly trying to live as best they could, yet were constantly swept away by the incessant waves of human frailty.
Consequently, there wasn't really one person to blame for each character flaw, yet ironically each character shifted responsibility to avoid being blamed for the step-family's eventual downfall.
A memorable yet haunting monologue given by Son is when he blames his cold-hearted mother for the violent rivalry within the family: "You taught us to hate those kidsÂand now look what's happened."
The sound design is masterful, and much needed for there is a lot of silence, and not a lot of dialogue, yet the sound design keeps us on edge whenever we need to be.
In this one, Randeep Hooda makes an excellent job as the aggressive yet ruthlessly calm "Dheshu" or 'D'.
Ram Gopal Varma does it again yet another movie which draws you into the reality of Underworld and introduces you to the machinery of Mumbai underworld.
Forget the throwaway title, this documentary about the wayward, moneyed Brigid Berlin is the equal of Terry Zwigoff's Crumb; a similarly troubling yet funny biography.
Cowboys are respectful, courteous, loyal, hard-working and yet, they do play hard.
Hidalgo delivers the story of a valiant horse who happened to be owned by a man that stumbled, fell and yet through arduous effort regained his sense of self and place in the world.
A story of personal redemption for a man who felt more than guilty for seeing the wrongs that were happening yet chose to say and do nothing.
No director has been imitated more than Alfred Hitchcock, and Still Of The Night is yet another in a seemingly endless line of homages to the Master's work.
Still Of The Night doesn't particularly rely on buckets of blood and graphic violence yet, thanks to skillful direction, atmospheric music and clever writing, it is genuinely jumpy from start to finish.
If you`ve no interest in war movies THE RED BERET may just appear to be yet another B movie about the war .
fail to stand out when written down; yet when combined with the delivery in the film they are poor enough to induce laughter.
I pride myself on thinking, seeing what is right in front of one's face, yet not seen.
But it substituted all that with a well thought out story and as for the lack of sex thats exactly what made the movie, or better yet Brooke Reynold, so sexy.
Virtually the entire film consists of a seemingly recreated real life dinner conversation between two friends, and yet somehow there's not moment that fails to keep the interest of the viewer.
Which is as of a piece with Andre's conversation, to me, a lot of which went over my head tonight (I saw the movie for the first time just 10 minutes ago) and yet left me terribly moved -- possibly like Wally Shawn's character.
The very last line of the movie, after all, tells us that Wally will repeat the entire conversation yet again to his girlfriend, of his dinner with Andre.
Their words feed our brains with rich and poignant imagery, yet no other location photography, sets or computer generated graphics are required and no violence is employed for cheap attention tactics.
And yet I found myself, somehow, even more engaged by the dialog between Shawn and Gregory than I did in Linklater's films (which is a close call as those are fantastic anyway).
Unfortunately, I have yet to find one good skin-flick that draws a clear distinction between true love and wanton sex.
They break into homes of the uber rich to rearrange furniture, leaving funny notes yet never stealing a thing.
What is more, their peculiar yet classical take on timeless questions of existence and their social awareness opened up a whole new perspective in audiovisual arts.
INNER Â is exactly what it promises to be--yet somewhat better.
*possible spoilers* I have a few complaints about this film, and yet I actually somewhat enjoyed it.
First of all, for the past five years I have worked closely with mentally disabled individuals, and although some of them are very kind, and have a loving nature, I've yet to come across one that would be capable of taking on the responsibility of raising a child.
So young and yet such a performance, and with such ease it seems!
As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7.
After hearing about it, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.
All-black variation on Biblical stories might strike some today as a stunt, yet the gloss and professionalism of the Warner Bros. studio is in full evidence.
Better yet, look it up!
Laptops, modern phones and televisions would not have been thought of yet.
Its only too long before Freddy begins yet another reign of terror.
Freddy is not quite the One Liner comedian yet (although he is funny), he cracks a few jokes here and there, but mostly he still lurks in this shadows, he's still creepy, and we still take him quite seriously, he still means business!
It has to be in the line of the first film and yet change a few things to make it nothing but a repeat.
But yet the boyish side is emphasized by a hairless body, shiny and pure skin, a skin that is widely shown and slowly brushed up and down by the camera.
I honestly liked Nightmare On Elm Street 2, i think it was the appropriate sequel to the first one.It had that 80's aspect that for me somehow made it more enjoyable.It was so simple in a way because they were not trying to yet make Freddy Krueger a Dream Master, or a Psycho Dream dude who was psychologically ill and all this is just making the series into a confusing wreck.Here we have a simple plot that tries to explain some stuff, but not to much.I like all the references to the first one, i basically look for that in all sequels, i guess it makes me feel cool to say,"Oh i saw that happen, i actually saw what happened".Ill admit at times it was cheesy, and there were some really unnecessary parts to it, but i liked the film.Overall you might be one of many who hates this movie, but give it a chance if your a fan of the first one or a Freddy fan than you will give this film its props for that.
Why was it important to show who tripped Ishaan yet not show her having any remorse over the fact that he really did not fire the gun deliberately?
He would begin with something and start to draw lines which don't make any sense and yet as they say "patience bears fruits", while you wait patiently, there emerges the unexpected master piece which you could not even imagine.
He projects authority, yet is warm and approachable, and isn't afraid to say he doesn't know what's going on.
Or win a decisive victory and save all of the agony yet to come at the possible expense of destroying the fabric of space/time... or at the very least causing the U.S. and the Allies to lose in the long run because the U.S. would have delayed entering the war?
On board as some sort of efficiency consultant is a young Martin Sheen, not yet ready for the West Wing.
She is unconventionally beautiful, yet beautiful all the same.
The scariest part is at the end of the movie where the mother and daughter are embracing and Mom is telling her that the ordeal is all over, but not quite yet!
For those who aren't familiar with the rules made up by Dogma yet, I'll give a small explanation: the director promises not to use extra light, special effects, extra sound effects...
Complex yet accessible, it creeps in under the skin and continues to seep deeper into the bones.
Today we have action films, historical dramas, romance, SF, etc that are commonly viewed as mass produced American cinema, yet they seem to represent little more than cliched genre pieces.
I saw it as a very simple yet compelling story; Two men live for only one thing: racing their car, which has been stripped down to its barest essentials in order to give it maximum speed.
Better yet its really romantic as the notion of "I will remember you forever" is put to the test.
The villain was amusing, yet not sugar-coated.
Better yet, why doesn't she call the fire department?
The only positive thing I might say is that the actress Sophia Dawny did a pretty good job and was convincing as a woman who was terrified yet started to grow strength as the movie progressed.
Better yet, they conveniently have flashing red and green LEDs on them (pretty low-profile, right?)
Notice that the kid was completely vaporized by the landmine, yet seconds later Dolph scoops up Johnny, who has only a bloody lip.
Ron Perlman did a great job of portraying the rough and tough oil man, yet was able to shift as the plot unfolded.
Real, dramatic, yet occasionally intense, against a bleak landscape, the realness of this story shone through.
But _Gasman_ comes to a kind a fruition--a full story with many of the same themes and techniques of _Ratcatcher_: closely observed yet elliptical human behaviour, housing projects, slum-beauty, children's natures, a jumbled impressionistic world caught in partial body closeups and shots from behind people.
However, I have one problem concerning the casting: I would have preferred the young and fresh Olivia de Havilland in the small yet pivotal role of Antoinette de Mauban, since Mary Astor looked old enough to be Douglas Fairbank's mother in the film.
For a time, I thought that it was a great yet brief duel scene in a classic film.
All in all, this is a superb yet obscure romantic adventure film that tackles an unusual subjectÂimaginary countriesÂand makes it work extremely well.
High points include an astonishingly beautiful Royal Ball, where Colman and Carroll reveal their love; a very funny yet menacing meeting between Colman and Fairbanks, as they discuss the real King's potential fate; and best of all, a MAGNIFICENT climactic swordfight between the pair, as they lunge and parry furiously through the halls of a castle, while exchanging quips and one-liners.
Mary Astor is the lovely Antoinette, Duke Michael's devoted, yet unfairly, neglected paramour.
Its real, its insightful, and it vividly portrays the complex emotions that go into relationships and the conflicting feelings that make them so exasperating and yet so irresistible.
'...one of the best scenes ** SPOILERS*** is when steve (russel crowe) gets set to leave in the middle of the night ...its funny yet at the same time it reveals an important aspect of any relationship ...the insecurity ...the insecurity of what if this wont work and the whole sequence is beautifully treated .
yet it speaks.
Having liked "Man of Aran" I went on to see Flaherty's "Louisiana Story" which is better yet.
From the beginning with the opening of "The Beast Within", Madonna begins with her partnership with music producer Stuart Price and having a very candid conversation about God and her beliefs and throughout the documentary, voices her opinion on the political and material world we live in today, yet she never comes across as preachy.
i found the whole film enormously riveting and gripping...and yet i am more stunned that there hasn't been more hype about it.
is this because a lot of people still haven't seen it yet?
), a girl's removed lower torso actually karate kicking a painting of a cat causing the evil cannibalistic spirit to overflow with blood, a disembodied head biting a girl on the buttocks, mattresses attacking a girl, giant lips attempting to eat the remaining girls not yet swallowed, and our lead girl's face shattering like glass, her body becoming a human inferno.
censorship during McCarthyism, rivalry and yet comradeship between writers, the actual process of brainstorming, the early TV-market economy demands from media barons vs. artistic freedom.
As far as I can tell, the actors knew they were being filmed and were probably paid (in drugs maybe), but yet I struggle to define this as a film.
Serious yet entertaining.
), and a "lacking" morality.... when further delved upon , seem to stand out to those involved [like the brightest of highway billboards] , yet seemingly and blindly passed over by most of those involved , like non-stick teflon brain tissue !
The actors were all serviceable if not excellent in their comic, yet quite human, roles.
Hall is stunningly sexy as usual, but her scenes with Abell really belong to her best yet.
Toni Lamond, the first woman to ever appear on Australian television, is a very sad, yet funny (!
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
Don't get me wrong the rest of the cast do a bang up job making this movie at once old sckool erie, creppy and dark yet a constant humor runs so obviously down the middle of every scene that it refuses to be missed.
Billie Burke is back as his heartbroken wife who fears she's losing her husband to yet another blonde.
Still, the film (scripted by future noir expert Jonathan Latimer and Gordon Douglas, who would become a director of some distinction and had actually just helmed the minor Laurel & Hardy comedy SAPS AT SEA [1940]) is a deft combination of various familiar yet irresistible elements which render the mix all the more pleasing.
But the other world isn't finished with him yet.
The suspense is built slowly as we see things that affect the life of the heroine, but she is not aware of them yet.
Jean Simmons is a reminder of yet another lost dramatic staple--a decorous, demure heroine, who speaks in complete sentences with flawless diction.
Finally, an excellent movie utilizing the dark and brooding past and secrets of India, while blending them perfectly with the modern era...A Die-Hard Royal Guard who is willing to lay his life for his Rana...A Royal Heir with a guarded past...A powerless Rana who has turned murderous...An uncle with greedy motives...A cop with umpteen respect for the old royal guard, yet lots of anguish against the palace...all this sums up to a great story by a master story-teller, well defined characters, some well executed action shots, and great performances, and you have a modern-day masterpiece...A must watch...Glad to know Indian Film Industry can still churn out great cinema...If anyone is criticising this film, just avoid them...and see this movie...you'll be glad...India has made a mark in the International scene this time...
Bollywood has been churning up some impressive films recently,and improving the quality of their films.But they have yet to learn to master the art of film-making.Their films are not yet perfect or great; they still have a long way to go.But after having seen this film,I'm glad to say that they are getting close.Bollywood has the potential to make great movies and they are trying and improving and almost getting there.But they still fall short of spectacular results.
However,what really keeps this film afloat is the acting.Each and every actor deserves equal recognition.They all have a part to play and they all help in move the story forward.You can't just give out all the praises to Bachchan alone.He was terrific,but the other actors allowed him to emote the character well.But,of course,Mr.Bachchan's performance is the strength of the film.His silence and his eyes says more than his words.I've never liked this actor and thought he was yet another over-hyped Bollywood actor,like any other.But after watching him in this,I understand why people worship him.But I still thought he could've done a little better.Saif Ali Khan was quite competent and gives a good supporting performance,but his character doesn't allows him to do much.This guy has the looks and moves of a good actor.Sanjay Dutt was just great in his small part.Booman Irani's character was flawed as well,and his acting sometimes goes from over the top to annoying.But if that's what his character was supposed to be,than he succeeds.He manages to make his character dark enough to be impressed.Jackie Shroff , Jimmy Shergil as well as the beautiful Vidya Balan have little to do and wouldn't really comment on them.
On the whole,this is an ambitious piece of work that could've been better.But for what it is,it's a fine example that Bollywood is capable of making good movies,only if they try.And I hope they keep making films like these.I would like to see more of it in the future.This, with films like Black Friday, proves that Bollywood is learning, and improving but they have yet to learn a lot to be able to compete at a world class level.
Now this film promos shouted classic from the top of the roof but sadly the film comes only half   The film starts off well, Sharmila's death scene is well handled and the drama thickens The film keeps you involved but sadly we expected much more The pigeons part was not well integrated in the plot and also the second half gets predictable and we know the actual killer  Even the Saif-Vidya romance track and the climax is half baked  Direction by VVC is excellent in parts only Camera-work deserves 5/5  Amongst actors Bachchan proves yet again he is an institution His body lang, dialogue delivery, expressions all are flawless even if he is just standing behind some lead actors he makes a maximum impact One of his best works Saif too does a great job,showing his growth as an actor Sanju is full of fun in his role and is brilliant in serious scenes His look and role is similar to THANEDAAR but he does a great job Vidya is mechanical Boman Irani excels in his part, Jimmy too excels in a negative role while Jackie is perfect
The film runs 105 minutes and yet you wonder why it took them so long to tell this thin thin tale.
Great locations, great back ground music and powerhouse yet subtle, nuanced performances make this a great watch in the cinema.
and yet it wont seem like there is any cut off.
Sanjay Dutt has a brief role, but he's fantastic all through.Vidya Balan is superb yet again.
Jackie Shroff gets a meaty role yet again in a Vidhu Vinod Chopra film.
Palace).... shimmering chandeliers, royal swords, candle lit harem's...they are mesmerizing...and so are the actors who have slipped into their characters as if they are living them from ages.. Mr. Bachchan is powerhouse at its best...Saif is yet again reserved but impact full...Jackie and Jimmy are at their evil best.
Saif Ali Khan impresses yet again; there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience.
Some jokes made by them did just pass by me, but I did smile and laugh at some others, which I think is a huge accomplishment for a movie, because I know there are some big Hollywood comedies out there, which people don't laugh at, yet they're big movies.
The mountain people of the Ozark region do not welcome strangers, yet this man seems to fit in with his quiet ways and his vast knowledge of the outside world most of the mountain people have never seen.
The first scene of the movie presents in a nutshell the experience that the viewer is going to have, an experience so common (regarding urban legends) yet so distant.
Neville is very complex, a scientist, a ruthless killer and yet a man who recites poetry and loves art.
A good movie, with a sad, yet hope-filled happy ending, this film is yet another feather-in-the-cap for Charlton Heston when he was in his sci-fi movie making period (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green) in his great career, and this particular "social statement" movie of the 70's remains relevant to this day.
The martial arts-superstar Gary Daniels (from "Fist of the North Star") is a great bad guy, with his icy-blue eyes and nonchalant attitude, and the woman both men love is also a Pyun-regular, Tina CotÃ©, who hasn't done many movies yet, but always gives her best performances in Pyun's movies (like "Nemesis 2", "Mean Guns", and "Omega Doom").
Chuck puts across so much loneliness and yet entirely avoids self-pity, as in "thanks a lot, you cheating bastard."
Based on the amazingly brilliant book "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson, the film shares most of the qualities of the book, yet excludes the portions that make "Legend" fantastic.
OK fine.. then he starts summoning, OK... not bad, then it drags out into a non-demon, shapeshifter that gets stronger when it eats flesh, yet still part of some occult plot according to our on-screen expert, some jailhouse nutbag that suddenly offers all of the 'dirt' to shovel into all the plot-holes.
And so much attention to detail of sets, yet these wimps slug Heineken from the bottle and I could see it was plain water...probably Poland Springs.
Now maybe I am not of marriageable age yet, but then standing up to whatever your friend had did is one thing I am clearly aware about.
Director Blasetti would go on to make another celebrated milestone of Italian cinema, the even more elaborate FABIOLA (1949) and, unfortunately, given their considerable reputation, both of these marvelous films are as yet unavailable on DVD even in Italy - although, the same can be said of several other little-seen but equally outstanding Italian epics including LA NAVE DELLE DONNE MALEDETTE (1953) and VIVA L'ITALIA!
The animation to this movie is bizarre but yet very vivid at the same time to the point of where you're saying exactly what I said in my summary: "Wow!"
The only issue is that some of the storyline leaves a couple holes at the end, making you wonder what happened but yet giving you an idea in your head of what you think might've happened.
White is stated as being eleven within the film yet quite clearly finds it difficult keeping a grasp on reality and his surroundings as his mental age is quite obviously, less than that.
Secondly, we have yet again another confrontation, another coming together of two forces yet this time it is more theory based.
Treasure Town is a gloriously colourful island sitting sedately in the centre of a river yet its buildings and inhabitants for all their grandeur seem incredibly outdated.
This second theme resonates with a fear of old replacing new, yet the new not being perhaps as grand as everyone believes it to be, it is a fear of traditions being eradicated by a machine which has no need for sentiment, and this feeling, from both points of view, is embedded within characters on all sides of the battle.
The phrase "my city" is uttered on numerous occasions as individuals all attempt to lay claim to the treasured turf, yet none truly understanding what the phrase means or why they are saying it.
Maybe Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley will be up for yet another installment of Sharpe's adventures.
If you haven't seen it yet.
Hopefully we will get to see some of the other books that haven't yet made it to film produced now.
The new characters were utterly splendid, Stephens as Dodd was one of the most evil villains ever to face Sharpe and Peter Hugo-Daly as Sgt Bickerstaff was a vile sight, yet a great performance.
Without being too extravagant there are enough special effects to make it look believable enough yet at the same time nothing is too out there.
It has this quality, where it reminds of of all kinds of different things that I can't quite place, yet is completely fresh and original.
I also liked the fact that ordinary items, or 'objects' are used as props to advance the story in a very cheap yet efficient way.
obviously Elisabeth Shue is a very good actress, Kris Kristofferson is a legend as always (Loved him in Hulk) and Oded Fehr was good although in it quite briefly (Much better acting than in the awful Resident Evil series) and Dakota Fanning was yet again outstanding.
The rest of the time, Fanning plays the horse-crazy, idealistic, and yet surprisingly level-headed Cale to a tee.
The premise of this movie is so similar to 2003's Seabiscuit, you'd think you're watching yet another biography of a real horse in some extraordinary, inspiring film that might just make you want to head down to the nearest race course and observe a real race.
Here's yet another reason to accentuate the 1970's was the absolute greatest decade for cult-trash cinema output (as if we weren't convinced enough already): Carsploitation movies!
I found that to be a little strange, since the Stooges normally suffer dozens of injuries in a short (similar to Pro Wrestlers) and yet I had never seen any of them sporting visible bruises to illustrate that they are being bullied.
In the second and most compelling 'chapter' of the movie, Harry (now played by the utterly talented Josse De Pauw) grew out a fairly intelligent adolescent, yet he still hasn't experienced physical love due to a severe (better make that EXTREMELY severe) case of acne.
The matter would easily lean itself to make it a sleazy and exploitative film, yet Deruddere's style remains sophisticated and truthful at all times.
Personally I haven't seen that movie yet, but I liked "Hombres complicados", the movie that he made before "Everybody Famous", a lot.
We see his hero, Harry Voss, first as a romantic young boy of 12, then as an acne ridden teenager, lost in unrequited love, and finally as a drink sodden drop out, for whom no act is too dreadful to contemplate...with terrible and yet deeply moving consequences.
Reflex Action is yet another feather in the hat of writer/producer/ director Kevin Rapp.
Bottom line: Kevin Rapp has done it yet again.
Allpresent butchering and manslaughter will probably filter out those weak and yet undecided, but this is here important part of artistic representation.
:) And the soundtrack itself is awesome, the Japanese guitarist/singer with a wailing voice and overemotional way of singing really made its job, yet repeating itself, which just really increased the power of his songs not to mention the way he really beats his guitar's strings.
Despite seeing the majority of his films released in America (and even a few that have yet to be released here...), it's hard not to feel like I've lost something in translation.
Even if you don't feel like you understand everything that's happening, you still realize this film is genius -- maybe you just haven't figured out why yet.
I have yet to understand why.
Miike's depiction of the title character, or more exactly his phantom life force, exceeds reality, time and space as a surrealist rendering of Izo's extraordinarily and endlessly gory yet philosophical confrontations in a literal infinity drenched by symbolic imagery and characterizations, and accompanied by the fascinating, hilarious, disturbing acid-folk singer Kazuki Tomokawa on guitar.
And yet the negativity comes from professed fans of his films...  As I was watching the film it occurred to me that this film maker, famed for the violent and bizarre content of his films and who seems keen on shocking his audience, must have increasing difficulties shocking anyone, as more fans follow his work.
The trailer made "Izo" seem to be an out-and-out action film to get the heart pounding, and yet it is so much more than this, as it gets the head pounding with unusual, inventive, symbolic visuals and philosophical discussions.
No doubt, "Izo" is extremely violent and brutal, yet one sees a message lurking in the blood.
In the end everyone's a victim, yet they're all guilty in some shape or form.
Izo is the sort of movie-thing that straddles the line between awesomeness, pretentiousness, and an as of yet unidentified third sector that cannot be described with human language.
The constant metaphors that keep popping up throughout the non-stop carnage bring more layers to the film than any 'shock' movie yet Miike still manages to throw in a few gallons of blood and a very interesting place to hide a sword (ladies) for good measure.
What I've written might sound non-sense if you haven't yet seen this and have no idea what it is like but this is as much as I can do to explain this film.
The action, singing and dancing are compressed into the lines of flamenco dances as tightly as pure emotion can be condensed into a sonnet, or any other strict form, and yet they transcend with the freedom of the gypsy spirit, if you but open yourself to the experience.
The producers said that it was hard to make a show based on a graphic novel that hadn't been finished yet.
It's style, somewhere between drama and documentary, nor it's story line have what usually makes a great movie, yet the music, the honesty of the actors, the scenery, the general atmosphere make Vengo a masterpiece of European impressionist cinematography.
If you want a retrospective of the Roswell incident played out in Hollywood style, this is the best yet.
It reminded me of one of my favorite stories of all time...James Michener's "Hawaii", yet it had its own sweetness and own story.
This truly shows you don't need to die to 'lay down ones life', but better yet, it's the putting aside our worldly desires for things of a better.
The special effects in the hurricane scenes were as good as any big budget movie production, yet maintained their focus on the central characters in the film.
I have yet to catch all of the movie on TMC but I have seen about 7/8ths of it.
I was not too eager to watch yet another documentary about the Holocaust, but had seen little on film about the Nazi's persecution of homosexuals, so decided to steel myself and give it a chance.
Dull, witless, a real pain to watch -- and yet, unbelievably -- it's based on a script which won First Prize in the Austin Film Fest's screenwriting contest!
The story-telling is direct, yet it's different from the heaviness and cruelty of "Night & Fog".
I shall forever be grateful to the producers, director, and survivors who shared their deeply personal stories, each unique, yet all with a common thread; one of having survived as homosexuals and lesbians during the Nazi era in Germany.
The screenplay, the work of three talents, is witty, comedic and yet touchingly romantic.
Then later, he's up against a marine-biologist with a fascist turn, attempting to expose Ms Hannah's fishy secret, of which he - Hanks - is as yet unaware (she's a mermaid, you see).
It's a life of immortality but from which he can never, ever escape (though he doesn't yet know it whilst he's submitting to her therapy).
The fact that you had this nutty guy going around trying to prove she was a mermaid, yet looking completely stupid and insane while doing so.. Oh man he was so funny.
The only thing he doesn't know yet, is that the beautiful and mysterious woman named Madison,is part of his childhood and also has a nature different from the human.
Turturro's particularly good in it as the best friend, yet her character is left out of the final half hour, though she's a central character, and never returned to.
I haven't yet seen a more vivid reflection on the style and attitude of California in the 1980s.
Partly because he can create movies that have good solid plots yet is able to transcend those plots to give us something else.
Del Toro seemed a little uncomfortable on screen, and it's always hard to see Harry Connick, Jr. trying to play a bad guy, but Silverstone was wonderfully bratty without overdoing it and Christopher Walken served up yet another delightful performance as the 'problem solver.'
All members of the community are basically insane psychopaths, yet you symphatize with them a lot more because the "hero" (Arthur) is such an antipathetic loser and the young generation (that eventually revolts against the town's ancient habits) are boisterous and uncanny freaks.
In my opinion it suffers somewhat from a low budget yet still manages to impress with screenplay and the gruesome reality it shows.
The tone is dark, yet strangely warm.
She stares at it like it is the strangest thing she has ever seen yet somehow she knows it should mean something.
And the often-used "Hooker with a Heart" character Penny is given new light and life by Mark Polish's careful crafting of the character and by Michelle Hicks edgy yet warm performance.
"Twin Falls Idaho" is a quiet yet possibly disturbing film (only if one is uncomfortable with the idea of looking at a pair of conjoined twins' physical features, which was actually only subtly featured).
I encourage anyone who has yet to see this movie to rent it or catch it on TV.
Using a clean fun environment was a beautiful sight to,rather than seeing gutters littered with derelicts,and yet in this movie no such thing exists.
Like most other reviewers, I could not help but notice how "perfect" the future was, yet how much it resembled the 20th century.
It is about that which is most basic, and yet often, most overlooked by all of us.
All these things were a part of the Charlie's Angels phenomena, and yet the key for me has always been the relationship of the three main characters.
Schmaltzy yet powerful film about a love that wasn't meant to be.
The "great" artists and their works are able to encompass the multiplicity of views rendering the complex simple enough to digest yet learn from (for the converted choir and the alienated masses).
For me I found something valuable from this movie yet I completely see the original poster's comments.
If you're black, you're poor yet humble.
Along with "Goodbye Mr. Chips" and Mr. Hollands Opus" this film is one of a handful of films that comes along once in a generation that leaves you feeling good and yet touched by the affection in the film.
Haven't we seen enough Hugh Grant movies yet?
The manner in which the film ends is yet another act of sacrifice and love and is best left unsaid.
"...There are still some things we have yet to imagine", is the slogan of this movie.
Kevin Kline is brilliant as the chilling yet endearing Nathan, whilst Peter MacNicol is the character whose superb narration and acting transmits us into the movie.
...all of the characters in this astounding book/movie were as good or as unimportant as viewers/readers found them to be, simply because William Styron developed them that way: Stingo WAS an unexperienced nerd, having lived an idyllic life in the South with nothing happening in his life, yet aspired to write the Great American Novel; how perfect for a virginous male to so fortunate to live with people who educate him what a horrendous journey life can be.
Mellodrama, intentionally so - yet, look at the entire work of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as examples of contrived performances.
She is at once radiantly beautiful, yet deeply wounded.
She is charming, yet vulnerable.
She is someone you want to love, yet someone whose pain keeps you at a distance.
While this is certainly not a film for everyone, it is yet again refreshing to see the chances that independent filmmakers will take.
And yet it is also Chad who makes his way upwards through the corporate ladder, Chad who charms his way into Christine's life, Chad who goes home to loving wife.
Cruelty is the underlining theme, yet you are laughing through most of the movie at what, unfortunately, can and does happen in the business world.
This is a totally unexpected find, a movie that you know nothing about when you sit down to watch it, yet totally engrosses you and blows you away.
Neil LaBute has given us his first in a very long line of challenging, yet beautiful, cinema.
Simple, yet effective, a very mature piece of work and pleasing overall.
"Strange Fruit.A poem written by a Jewish high school teacher Abel Meeropol.A song made famous by Billie Holiday.Abel wrote it after he saw a photo depicting the lynching of a black man in the south.Something so beautiful came out of such a tragic event.Shivers go down your spine when you hear Billie Holiday perform it.Your eyes get wet.You ask yourself why and yet you get no answer.How could something like that happen such a short time ago?
Andrew Keegan, in yet another obscure film, plays the "hero", Bobby, and does so with his usual gusto.
It's rare that you see a movie that's so cheap yet so cool.
Certain characters are animated, some eccentric, some very stoic, and some are combinations of all three, yet they never become even remote resemblances of clichÃ©s.
Believe me, the characters are soooooo close to home.. Corrente really was able to portray the "spacone" better than a lot of other directors were able to do.. Definitely watch this movie.... and if your from Rhode Island and haven't seen it yet.... rent it.. buy it.. watch it.. get some haven brothers and watch it....
I have not yet seen the recent DVD release, but I probably will purchase it.
There is a certain joy of life depicted in this film that is in some ways also bittersweet (and yet refreshing).
There are a lot of other unpretentious, yet memorable, moments in this outstanding film.
Behaviour is checked, emotions kept inward; yet when people look inward they find a seething that terrifies.
Imamura's film is strong and subtle, warm yet critical.
and `Do you have a girl yet?'
Yogi Bear is a free spirit who chafes at the rules and regulations of his limited world, and yet enjoys the comforts it offers.
I don't expect everyone to agree with me but I hope that all of you Bette Davis fans that haven't seen this movie yet will PLEASE SKIP this one!
And yet...
And yet... all those actors near the tops of their careers... a first-class MGM production from the golden age... and Mrs. Hermosillo Brunch!
This is the best Disney sequel yet, even better than enjoyable efforts like the Lion King sequels.
It was very funny yet it was also a strong story showing Bambi getting to know his father, very emotional at some points!
He is one of my very favorite actors of his age, yet here his performance is very muted and he's given a very bland part.
He was there for a very minor problem, yet soon he was carrying in all sorts of supplies that had nothing at all to do with the problem at hand.
She is an expert at primitive cultures, yet is unable to deal with her own 'civilized' culture.
Superficial people have criticised the studio based battle sequences (a budgetary necessity) yet those of us with some knowledge of naval warfare are qualified to heap praise on the production.
(If you haven' seen this yet, don't ask.)
Woman is the Future of Man pretty much follows all these traditions and yet somehow, like most of Song's films, manages to remain interesting the whole way through.
The three shortly gather for a night of drinking, although ultimately, the film doesn't show any emotional culmination or yet still arrive at an apparent close.
Hong Sang-soo's "Woman is the Future of Man" is yet another great addition to the impressive national cinema of South Korea and one that pushes me to continue exploring more of this body of work.
It's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll: mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy (have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in a bog?)
Perhaps the foreign language helps to make the other world both more exotic, yet more believable at the same time?
I know I saw Men..., Happy Birthday!, Nobody Loves Me, yet I can't for the life of me remember the plots.
The virgin is often seen touching herself at the sight of other couplings, yet even here the viewer is struck (unless he's an idiot, like the goons) with the knowledge that a woman masturbating over sex could be merely a male sexual fantasy (which is not to say women don't masturbate about the most un-PC scenarios, but the occasions it happens in this film remain self-consciously self-serving).
The film follows Powers' rise to the top of the crime ranks and eventual, yet inevitable, fall.
Jean Harlow shares top billing with Cagney, yet her role is rather small and does not really justify her name being above the title.
Harlow, soon to become a part of film legend in films such as RED DUST and BOMBSHELL, shows a sniff of her star presence in a couple of scenes, yet is noticeably flat and oddly lethargic in her role as a gangster's moll.
The two later killed him in his own pad, yet.
He leaves them in a lurch, and yet they continue their criminal rise as pals.
I guess the code was not yet firm enough in place to prevent the presentation of a tailor as a homosexual.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
It is shot mostly in muted tones, yet avoids the trap similar films have fallen into - namely looking too dark and leaving the audience wondering if they need to turn the contrast on their TV up.
The interiors of the mansion is clean, cool, yet as the characters clearly describe, has an atmosphere of death.
**SPOILERS** Unbelievably corny yet fascinating movie that has Joan Crawford pay more or less herself as the bossy and arrogant Broadway superstar Jenny Stewart.
And yet, based on information I heard directly from the writer of a once top-rated TV show, there are actresses (and actors) who really are as horrid as the vicious fang-baring demon that Joan portrays in this hideous laughfest.
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
Whenever someone talks about Universal classic horror films, two names always tend to show up in the course of the conversation: Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, two very different yet still similar persons who in 1931 shared the privilege of becoming the first monsters of the sound era in two enormously influential films.
On the train to VisegrÃ¡d, the couple meets Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Bela Lugosi), a charming yet strange man who like them, will take a bus to GÃ¶mbÃ¶s as he is planning to visit an old friend.
Like a previous reviewer, I saw this movie in theaters more than 30 years ago and not once since, and yet much of it I remember with amazing clarity.
The Forbin Project is classic sci-fi movie, and yet is criminally neglected.
Frees gives Colossus an emotionless yet fearful quality of speech that seems to belie its implacable drive to dominate human destiny.
The film is not overlong, yet the characters and their futility to stop the unstoppable is clearly developed.
Even though we may not create a defense system in this way, it seems to predict a visage of something that is yet to come.
And sargent's direction matches script and performances in being understated yet uncompromising -- surprising me at every turn.
Incredibly complex and odd assortments of novelties ranging from Sadism, Superstition to Satan worship fill this stylish yet confusing film.
Though, I've yet to see "Dracula".
This person cannot even write a simple sentence, yet they feel they can bash a show that is obviously superior to their own banal excuse for intellect - and I don't even know what that means.
Professional and surprisingly successful remake of George A. Romero's groundbreaking horror milestone with the same title, that retells Â in color Â the simplistic, yet still very unsettling premise of recently deceased corpses that rise from their tombs for unknown reasons, and go after the living.
Karloff is evil, yet magnetic, and Lugosi's hero is sympathetic and well-intentioned, but also callous and overtaken by some far less admirable traits.
Even as a kid, I admired the 'big concept' of the film: Murder is wholesale in Nazi Europe, yet one freak is buying it retail, and another has only as much morality (or perversity) as is necessary to obsessively hunt the small murderer, but not the larger ones.
Sharif is surprisingly good as the dedicated police officer, Courtney excellent as a sensitive yet firmly grounded young soldiers, and O'Toole is superb as the epitome of a ruthless SS officer.
There is no blood and yet it is more gruesome than many of today's graphic moments.
Karloff plays one of his most deliciously evil yet charming and sophisticated characters yet.
And yet, despite the bloat, despite the stunt casting, despite the fact that Philippe Noiret is more wooden than the Black Forest, it works.
It's rare to find a villain so distasteful and yet so intriguing - most filmmakers just content themselves with giving the villain an evil shtick without much character development - not so here.
The story is totally absurd and very simple (The black cat storyline has absolutely nothing to do with the movie and serves no purpose at all) but yet that is what maybe makes this movie extremely fun and easy to watch.
They feel uncomfortable around the pleasant yet strange man, and are eager to continue their tour of Hungary, when tragedy befalls Joan and Peter in an automobile accident and Verdegast and Peter are both forced to take her to the residence of Hjalmar Poelzig (Karloff), the very man Verdegast is expecting to drop in on.
Wood credited him in the title role, yet Lugosi didn't even technically star in the film at all.
"Detour," often regarded as his finest moment, was shot in six days with a band of B-actors, yet it still remains a cult classic today, even finding a spot in Roger Ebert's Great Movies compilation.
But then a federal investigator noticed a discrepancy in one of the documents...  Vincent Price, not yet the ham actor he would be later, gives a riveting performance as Reavis.
This has its consequences, as she falls prey to Jose Ferrer, as a quack astrologer and a skilled (yet egotistic) hypnotist.
Overall, a flawed, yet underrated work (however deserves more praise, but not too much) from Otto Preminger, with both Gene Tierney (who is always worth watching) and Jose Ferrer a pleasure to watch.
Even the Germans shoot at the other Germans who are hiding behind a tank early in the movie yet, Later, in pitch black one of the men can identify the Lieutenant from 1/4 of a mile away as he walks down a hillside.
Charles Bickford also gives a marvelous performance in a smaller, yet layered role as the rumpled, grieving Detective.
And with a cool red-tinted spaghetti western style shootout at the end, it's worth sitting through this interesting yet deeply flawed Italian-Spanish poverty-row production.
This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective: the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile?
Particularly bad is the comic relief, which comes in the form of horny, yet unattractive monkey (I know it sounds funny, but it never is).
Recommended to: People who like dinosaurs, the best CGI around (along with "Finding Nemo" 's and "The Polar Express 's), beautiful real backgrounds, lovely characters and a good storyline, which isn't all too exciting yet it doesn't make the film boring!
This was yet another example, when it came out in 2000, of the latest strides being made in animation, computer-or-otherwise.
Talky and melodramatic - and certainly unbelievable (the middle-of-nowhere desert gas station is almost always FULL of people, for starters), this stagy, yet classic film is not for everyone.
The feeling of stars and huge sky above is conveyed by dialogue only and is yet palpable nonetheless; there in spirit if not fact.
Humphrey seems to put a lot into his gangster character, investing Duke with the necessary evil demeanor, yet also with a hint of heart and soul.
But in my opinion she played her character very well: in her "hindsight"-dialogues she's the unappealing, street-wise and cocky white-trash bimbo who doesn't give a damn, yet her self-reflections on the comments of Peter impress as genuinely sincere.
Rutger Hauer looks nothing like Fred who was tall and thin yet the movie although stereotyped is fairly accurate.
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
It's cool, original and intriguing, yet it's simple and not hard to keep track of.
It's kind of a dark story, yet there are lot of funny elements to light it up a bit.
Jean Reno has a small, yet very nice part.
The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie succeeds as a great piece of cinema because its lead character is one of the most realistically drawn characters in film history- he's a thug and a killer, yet one who is explicable.
It is unique, mysterious and moving, yet simple and elegant.
Through questioning and a series of flashbacks, it looks like Chae is in the frame; yet, murders continue while she is under surveillance.
And yet, at the end, there is no absolute clarity, even though the identity is obvious.
Sadly, Tell Me Something has yet to get a US release (outside of all too rare arthouse screenings from time to time), and after two years it remains unreleased on VHS or DVD.
I have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release, but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING, I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes, experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 (besting even The Matrix), and one of the Top 5 Horror/Thrillers of the decade!
Written and directed and produced and acted by Lisa Niemi the story involves the return to the boards by three retired dancers (Lisa Niemi, Patrick Swayze, George de la Pena - all three are dancers in real life) to pay homage to the gifts of a highly regarded yet now dead choreographer.
Lisa Neimi wrote and directed this movie...she is the only director yet who actually knows how to direct a dance film.
The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.
I am amazed, yet glad to see that there are others out there who love the movie, as well!
The man easily travels through Time and Space and yet he keeps falling into Space all of the Time?
You can never get enough of this movie.Its brilliant Its beautiful yet very disturbing.
Asmi is disappointed at their decision, but doesn't give up just yet.
He plays with narrative and plot, introducing characters seemingly at random, yet he's always in full control, and the fun is in finding out just that.
So, if you have NOT played this Playstation game yet and don't want to know ANYTHING about it, stop reading NOW!
Turns out, a family of deranged in-breeders, residing in the deep backwoods of Minnesota, are kidnapping people and releasing them into the wild in order to hunt them for sport... With the use of some crafty lies, Dean manages to coax the cop into accompanying him to his brother's rescue, though not without difficulty... Like many horror fans, I have an appreciation for killer hill-billies and "The Benders" pulls off a pretty standard-style of the sub-genre, yet it is interesting to see these two dynamic characters involved in this particular setting.
In fact, if it wasn't for Mary Woronov's secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy Selina, this would be a total loss.
I have not seen the first one yet but am eager to...the 3 DVD set on amazon looks great.
It's as if Warhol influenced the film-making, yet Tennessee Williams influenced the content.
The ending is a disappointment too; there is yet another plot twist in the last few minutes and the story just stops.
No creative people return and yet the style and tone are very reminscent of the first film.
Remy is a noted entomologist and author of at least a popular scientific account of insects, yet she teaches elementary school.
Little flaws in the narration of the movie (which are basically negligible, compared to other Bollywood flicks and even many of Hollywood flicks) are forgiven by the powerful yet very subtle act by the two actors.
His performance is so amazingly understated, and yet so powerful.
I haven't seen his "The Rising: The Song of Mangal Pandey" or "Rang De Basanti" as yet, but I am confident that he burrowed deep into the souls of the characters of those films, too.
This takes place deep under water and yet many of the shark attack scenes show a shark swimming at the surface.
We are told in the movie at 1 point that they have a 10 minute supply of air and yet fires are raging out of control all over the station.
This straight-to-video Bulgarian American co-production is yet another awful Nu Image Films 'Creature Feature' about killer Sharks, co-produced & directed by Danny Lerner this is one truly terrible film.
Initially I thought the Bermuda Triangle setting was going to lead to something but it quite literally never does, why emphasise the fact that your film is set in this notorious region & yet make absolutely nothing out of it?
How could she stay underwater for so long without breathing gear & yet survive?
Favorite bits: the seaplane approaching the base, yet with the shore only a few hundred yards away.
The lab disintegrating at the end and yet the couple miraculously appearing in full scuba regalia and surviving the accent (several hundred feet in seconds?!?!).
It is funny, yet serious.
Each attraction is viewed with similar disgust from the suburbanites, yet they make no effort to leave the show, which seems to call to Water's fascination with the American public's fascination with the fringe of society.
Featuring Melanie Griffith at her whiniest and most annoying yet.
watch the movie only if you're desperate to see melanie griffith in yet another role as a skimpily clad sexpot.
This isn't your conventional love story, and yet it will leave a mark.
Their soft yet mellifluous melodies compliment the film wonderfully.
You have managed to create what I didn't think was possible in todays world-- a Bollywood film that makes you laugh, cry, feel sad and yet happy at the same time, and also doesn't make you ashamed to take your non-indian friends to.
MUSIC : Rocking, youthful and yet melodious.
Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is not high on melody yet the title track and "Pretty Woman" are very hummable though I didn't dig "It's The Time To Disco" .
She could act, she proves yet again that she is not just a cute girl with a dimple on her cheek.
Shahrukh was good, yet again but Saif is the surprise.
Kal Ho Naa Ho is really the finest movie of 2003 yet.
While I've never been a Mormon, I do have a scientific background, and I found the science (and the scientific conclusions) very straightforward and solid, and yet it is done in such a way to make it accessible to the layperson.
Most of the movie consists of the serial killer movie -- not as it's being filmed, but as it plays in finished form, which is odd because it keeps switching back and forth between the serial killer movie and "reality," when the movie isn't finished yet.
Many people that I've spoken to about The Sopranos (who haven't seen it yet) will say "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies/shows".
His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy.
Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively.
Though "The Sopranos" is yet another gift from the megahit "The Godfather" and sequels, which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia, "The Sopranos" takes another tack.
To get to the bottom of his attacks, he sees a psychiatrist, Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time.
The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever, so naturally my expectations were through the roof, and yet the show surpassed them.
Symbolism and simple story lines, dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect HBO package.
Above all stand two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela... as for Gandolfini, he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express, if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now!
She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey.
I wouldn't go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, or at least, not just yet.
Season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was).
The imagery of Beyond Borders, both visual and verbal , gives pause for thought : Like Sarah Jordan, aid-relief workers most likely have those in their personal lives who say "don't go, it's not safe there," yet they remain motivated to go anyway.
Who are the Dr. Callahans who travel to yet another location once their camp is shutdown - perhaps because of reparation or funding cuts?
The ending of the movie was unexpected, and yet, in retrospect, it couldn't have ended any other way.
It is a world wholly unique yet still hauntingly familiar.
It is dark and strange yet very much deals with real issues.
They have memories of being those people, but they are not those people and they are not yet comfortable in their skins.
The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them.
Alex Proyas (The Crow) manages to combine a tantalisingly interesting Sci-Fi screenplay with dark and drab yet beautifully mysterious cinematography and he pulls it off (once again).
The costumes for them are perfect and could not have been done better, they live in the world underground and you see the different lifestyles between them and the people they control, yet live above them.
The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities).
Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch.
While it is reassuring to see that the American president saves the day yet again, not even the casting crew stars can save this film.
), yet not injure the pilots or cause any damage to the flight deck is astonishing.
A film which isn't a commercial in any aspect, yet your gloved in it.
Morgan Freeman's son is hilarious in that he mimics his dad in any uncanny fashion, yet brings his own style to the role.
I don't know what a "Razzie" is, but this smacks of yet another childish insult.
And they were so fake and bad, like when there in the woods, yet there on sand?
Douglas has yet to learn, from Tennessee, his new friend Carole (Michelle Lee) and from Herbie himself, that in the quest for validation in life, some people are capable of selfishness and stepping on others' feelings.
It's safe to say that Indiana Jones has nothing to worry about just yet, though RJ does display an annoying knack for not dying despite the endless opportunity for the baddies to shoot him, which was often.
And while I'm on the subject of the plot, I felt it was fairly obvious from the start who was behind it all and yet, our heroes have to go through Hell and back (and a utterly pointless sex scene) before finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
I have been looking forward to seeing the film version of Gil Courtemanche's book 'Un Dimanche Ã  la piscine de Kigali'; it was a disturbing yet beautiful film.
Staffers on the film were intimidated by her name dropping, yet in Hitchcock, she found a kindred spirit, someone she could talk with endlessly on the set.
Here we have a story that is stationary, no movement in terms of setting or action and yet with a fine cast and wonderful writing, Hitchcock was able to create a timeless and suspenseful drama dictating what great lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive as well as the goodness of mankind that can shine through.
Some of the gag's meander a bit, like Bogart's Marlowe; yet I somehow feel Bogie's odd, bemused non reaction to the mayhem is perfect.
Lifeboat deserves a lot of acclaim, yet its lesser-known status doesn't allow justice in that respect.
The plot is simple, yet a great base for a wartime thriller.
At date of writing this film has yet to earn 350 votes in the IMDb, meaning it falls short of the top 250 despite it's 7+ score.
The real hidden star, though, is late-70's London-- oh so run-down and yet full of the potential that drives Harold's ambitions.
Sneering, brutal, impulsive, yet fragile, Bob Hoskins infuses the character with swinging histrionics that'd put Edward G. Robinson to shame.
With the possible exceptions of BRIGHTON ROCK and GET CARTER,"The Long Good Friday" has a strong case in being the best British gangster film yet produced.It thankfully lacks the jokey,facetious and overtly bloody attitudes that has plagued most UK-based hybrids since the 1990's (as personified by Guy Ritchie and others).It's occasional lapses into nastiness and schematic excesses are easily outweighed by an excellent script (which possesses considerable caustic wit),fine direction,great performances and memorable scenes.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should make it your next rental.
"Sweet Little Sixteen" was written and performed by Chuck Berry when he was thirty two years old; yet the rocker captures the innocence and lust of being young and carefree.
If you are ready for a ClichÃ©, stereotypical, and yet totally hot and fun gay comedy then sign yourself up for Sloppy seconds.
Be warned this time its full of much more shocking and crazy situations, yet guaranteed more laughs than the first, so in fewer words if you liked the first you will love this one even more.
There is just no way that a movie about '60 minutes' should be 3 hours long, yet Michael Mann finds a way to drag this out, much like he did in Heat.
Although the movie's subject was the corruption of a cigarette-manufactory and the way a honest man and a journalist work together to bring it out, the mainstream was the courage of a man nearly paralyzed by fear yet determined to do what has to be done.
The writers + directors have been saying it will come, but no news yet... Long live Freaks and Geeks!!
Just as Undeclared, which also got canceled after one season, this show is a stroke of genius which every fan of a good TV-show and yet every fan of something good at all, should watch.
All the characters are insanely believable yet entertaining.
The geeks are not understated, and yet never over the top.
In fact, there are times when he comes off as manipulative and creepy and yet there is a sadness in his character that I haven't quite seen before.
In "Discos and Dragons" he finally finds something he's good at, disco, and yet it's revealed to the viewer that the disco will close within a weeks time.
Nicolas Cage is also fine as Sean's goof-off buddy, yet the slim screenplay hasn't enough meat on its bones and the middle portion of the film goes around in circles.
You can tell that this movie has been made with all guts, heart and soul, or passion if you like, it sparkles all over the frame.The suffering and pain of teen years (and the joy of friendship, love and sex) are portrayed in a very poetical way.Both visual and acoustic poetry (the movie is narrated by the character "el garganta" as if reciting a somewhat complex yet beautiful poem).
Snoop Dogg has proven that he is a great rapper, but he has yet to prove that he is a great actor.
If you are a horror B-movie fan and you have not seen this flick yet go rent it now!
this movie has a lot of old ideas all mixed into one, yet it doesn't look messy, several teen agers try and open a night club, on "holy ground" without noticing, one of the teenagers finds a girl but her mother is the local "crazy person" they ignore her about this but it was a bad move, when the club is up and running the fun begins, from maggots to wall of dead, its a fun thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Bone's old woman, played by Pam Grier (a good actress wasted in yet another trashy movie), is psychic and can tell that something bad is brooding in the air.
The acting is a bit tireless, yet when taken into context of the genre of the satire, then it places well.
John-Michael Lander is very convincing as the 'gay-god' that has decided to fall in love and yet can't give up his other life.
I have yet to learn why this superb drama has never been taken out of the archives and released on DVD.
Yes, Bresee turns into yet another monster.
And even Columbo's pet "Dog" makes a brief, yet memorable, appearance.
And yet for all its ponderous and portentous stylings, it says nothing to us about survival or friendship or civilization or etc.--all the Big Issues this type of movie is supposed to have us ponder--that we don't get from airheaded Hollywood blockbusters like "Armageddon" and "War of the Worlds."
None of the characters act at all rational, and yet they are all surrounded by amazing sets and brilliantly realized visions of the apocalypse.
Basically the movie centers around the two leads trying to make it back to Tokyo and their adventures along the way with a cast of unique and at times plain creepy characters showing up along the way, there are some flaws here and there but overall this is a great emotional, bleak, depressing yet in the end hopeful movie that I fully enjoyed and I personally thought the two lead actors did a superb job and at times the visuals and landscape were depressing yet stunning.
It is purpose-driven, and yet, it neither condemns nor judges anyone.
We are all to be held accountable for our actions, yet, God can forgive anyone who sincerely asks.
I hope that more thought-provocative yet diplomatic films like this one will be created in the future to cause humanity to think about its actions and how far it has gone with the right-to-this and the right-to-that to justify them.
Captain Jack is a tragic character, sometimes in hot water through no fault of his own, yet performing a dastardly deed to help win his love that precipitates the demise of many of the main characters.
If you haven't seen this yet, go rent it.
Dick Bush's cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in Chicago and in the farm towns of America, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation.
In that scene, Wallace tells Ness that one of the city's most notorious mobsters, Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro in an amusing yet in wicked fashion) has committed tax evasion.
This movie just reeks of farce, from the accountant mowing down people with a shotgun with the nerdy grin symbolizing his transformation from mild mannered nerd to empowered bad-ass to the completely arbitrary scene of Robert DeNiro hitting a guy with a baseball bat (no back story,no plot movement, seemingly no reason for it to be in the movie whatsoever)to Sean Connery getting blasted with seemingly dozens of machine gun bullets, bleeding enough to have died three times over, and yet still having the power to gasp a few more words just as Elliot Ness gets there before finally dying.
Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used most of it for John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, they must have missed it that time I presume!
What's odd, though, is that A.C. knows he has superhuman abilities underwater and yet never once questions where they came from.
How can the Execs at CW not run a show that the audience has never seen yet.
Aquaman is obviously not the most recognised or popular superhero around and yet this show managed to give him a fairly cool edge.
CW hasn't even come out yet, and already, they made a stupid decision.
The first season is far more immune to this flaw, yet the later ones are the one I'm referring to right now.
sad to see two formerly excellent actors walk their way through yet another film to pick up a paycheck.
* The conversation at the captains table made perfect sense for me, given the babel that is India - 1000s of languages, yet holding together as a perfectly functioning anarcho-democracy!!!
Like stones paired in a stream, they break yet don't halt the flow.
Mother and daughter have a past, yet the artifice does not: the film is circular.
Each woman talks in her native language, and yet, they all seem to understand what each one is saying.
Like Maria Joana we are mesmerized by what we see, yet each scene is tinged with such a pervasive air of sadness that it seems to suggest we are getting one last look.
Each talk in his or her own language yet everyone seems to understand each other perfectly.
He seems to have been a tragic, yet interesting fellow.
Rudy, his main character, is a man born and raised in East L.A., as the title indicates, yet, he is deported to a country he probably has never been to.
His roots are American, yet being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, trying to do a favor to his cousin, he is hauled to a detention center for illegal aliens and deported to Mexico.
I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel, but I've yet to see a movie adaptation that was better than the book.
Wuornos does not come across as a "monster" (the name of a subsequent fictionalised account of her case) but as very human; and yet she seems incapable of comprehending the significance of death, even her own at the hands of the state.
The system treated her badly, and I personally oppose the death penalty in all cases; and yet it's hard to imagine how anyone in her position could generate less sympathy than Wuornos does.
Written, produced & directed by Charles Band & made under his Full Moon company this is yet another killer toy flick one maybe cynically would suggest is more interested in starting a new line of collectible toys than entertaining.
The most important thing about this movie is that it tries to be part of the killer doll genre of horror movies and yet the killer dolls in this film take a back seat to every other amazing character that steps on screen.
And yet Jenny Wright is a lot of fun (she's like a kindred spirit to Joan Cusack).
The killer in this keeps a scarf over his face like "The Shadow" and he sounds ridiculous but it's always so comical yet tense.
For fans of horror flicks, this movie might be a nice little surprise if you haven't yet seen it.
Alas, it has not yet found it's way to DVD.
Thank fate for the 1970s when Hollywood finally got a social conscience that has yet to be fully interred for the sake of the interests of the National Security State myth.
But yet they all still overcame their own prejudices, some longer than others, and it's very beautiful to watch.
In place of what should have been a violent, seen-it-all-before conclusion to yet another psycho killer movie, you get the coming attractions reel for the film -- An idea that has merit (if it had been planned that way) since the movie is set in a Drive-In and all.
No comments about this mistake yet this year?
What is important to remember is that Wyler and Warners were not doing a send-up of the yet to be released GWTW, but rather using Owen Davis' 'old and often produced play.'
There's some murders in the drive in, yet nothing is done with them even tough the film supposedly revolves around solving the case, yet it really didn't feel like it.
Think about it...three nights in a row people are butchered at the drive-in and yet they keep the place open AND people continue to fill the place every night!!
It's an honest yet hopeful look at the no-budget end of genre film-making.
It's a strong and independent woman for her time (the movie is set in the 1850's), yet also spoiled and stubborn, who of course eventually has to pay for her deeds.
The ending is perfect as it plays far more realistically than the comeuppance of Darling where the heroine has achieved the status of a princess but yet she is deathly bored.
Frank Langella (HBO Unscripted) portrays stuffy Blaine De Castillion, an aging minor diplomat who marries a trophy wife only to be thrown over by her for yet another monosyllabic athletic type.
Thomas Gibson as the steely agent for the multinational public relation agency that represents Tina never permits his client to be anything but the innocent yet desirable money-making product.
Gibson's brief b/w screen time reflects a high production cosmetic ad and both Pare and Gibson are beautifully photographed to highlight their physical attractiveness, yet theirs is the only on screen relationship never consumated.
With little exposure beyond HBO screenings, Stardom continues to be true to the reality TV trend, yet, while it was ahead of its time, particularly in comments about full frontal nudity and Meg Ryan that unfortunately have come true, Arcand's film is often so subtle its droll satire flies over the heads of an unreflective public failing to grasp the humor and truth of the informed filmmaker.
The supporting cast includes Verna Bloom as Duvall's long suffering girlfriend and Eddie Egan as his crusty yet benign superior.
Not to mention sorry for the people who financed it because you pray they can somehow make their money back and yet you know they probably won't.
The scenes with Charles are incredibly funny yet pretty damn sad.
He and his two brothers (his two sisters declined the spotlight) seem to have been just a skosh away from becoming serial rapists or worse--yet it didn't happen.
yet these and other "bad" and "good" elements of his personality were not labeled, but accepted.
Either way, he's the comic book version of John Waters - ahead of his time in grossness, incredibly influential, and not yet surpassed.
I've often wondered if I've ever made myself this vulnerable to anyone ever, and yet Crumb and his brothers do it for the whole, entire world.
It's a shame that Terry Zwigoff hasn't done yet another documentary, because he obviously has a knack for the genre.
He seemed to really understand just how close and yet how far back he needed to be at the same time.
If you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself for something both vulgar and heartwarming, charming and repulsive.
Zwigoff does a wonderful job of setting a mood that allows you to examine an artist who is depraved, perverse and, yet, insightful.
And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.
Simple yet mindblowing things, like how he approaches sketches of photographs from a 19th century sanitarium, or his sourcebook with pages of photos of suburban streetlights and electrical substations, give insight into the mechanisms of his genius.
Little histrionic moments are blown up to gargantuan proportions and yet important events about her or the French Revolution are all but forgotten.
I was delighted to see this at the rental store because I absolutely adore Norma Shearer and had yet to see this piece of work.
Most annoying is Herbie Hancock's score, hugely derivative of Lalo Schifrin's cop movie music yet not ever quite interesting.
It's plot isn't entirely realistic and feels like a comic book story yet in some strange way it works.
Presenting his characters honestly yet sympathetically, he makes the somewhat contrived situation seem believable and worth caring about.Wonderful movie with super hit songs.
All the characters are quirky, colorful, yet realistic.
Scorsese gives it a realistic, yet outrageous feel and knows how to let the suspense draw out and build skillfully and Joseph Minion has written himself a little bitty treasure.
The pace seems deceptively slow on the first screening, but on repeated viewings it becomes clear that not a moment nor line is wasted, and that every little action links to something yet to occur or something that has already passed.
In both films, the nice guys take a trip that would turn brutal, bizarre, dangerous yet irresistibly funny.
The message here is that one can be successful and comfy in a world of one's own choosing, yet a foreigner and even viewed as a threat in a different setting.
I love the whole bizarre set up, the weird coincidences (for example the piece of newspaper stuck on his arm which talks about a man being ripped apart by vigilantes in the very area he can't get away from - and then the weird woman says 'I'll burn it off' - yet more reference to burns) Love the 'Berlin club', and the idea of the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel paper weights - so evocative of that pretentious era!
The plot seems to flow randomly and the movie always defies your expectations, yet it's as tightly assembled as a jigsaw puzzle.
One especially stupid victim somehow eludes the monster, yet suddenly forgets how to climb a ladder, allowing the unbelievably slow creature to sneak up behind her.
A lovely character study/comedy-drama richly deserved--yet did not get--Oscar nominations for all three of its acting principals (it did receive one nomination, for Robert Benton's original screenplay).
He is a sad and lonely character who is socially awkward yet surprisingly tough.
At least American Pie was entertaining and the comedy was raunchy yet interesting.
Bette Davis reacts to the camera with an economy of gestures, and yet, she speaks volumes of what is going on inside her soul.
A VERY flawed, yet entertaining step back in the right direction.
Sean Connery plays Edward Pierce, a comely yet conniving thief of thieves, who decides for his next project to lift the Crimean Gold from a train bound for Eastern Europe.
Connery was pretty good here, trying to move beyond his James Bond persona, yet not quite escaping it.
Olivia makes a tremendous leap in her acting abilities following a rather "wooden" (pun intended) performance as a mannequin in yet another Christmas television movie, "A Mom for Christmas."
It really seems bleak, but it all works out in the end, and Olivia turns in her strongest role yet.
It is unbelievable that this movie has yet to be released on DVD - it was a top 10 favorite the year it was made, and has been re-run on television throughout the years since.
If you haven't watched this one yet, I recommend it for a fun family movie evening.
Pretty cheesy 80s film, few but strong horriable words, but yet the crooks do come up with a pretty (although sick) clever scheme when they get Chucky and Bingo.
Unfortunately this is yet another case of third movie blues as ÂCandyman: Day of the Dead' soon becomes a virtually intolerable bore of a horror movie with little redeeming features.
Those who are yet to see the original Candyman may find some enjoyment in the movie, despite his inept writing skills Turi Meyer's direction was generally fairly tight for such a farcical movie and one has to give him some credit in that department.
'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
We do not see a single kiss between this couple, yet Jed is bristling with passion that is uncontrollable.
I was hoping for a gripping and thrilling story yet I was bored to tears and found that I had to force myself to watch it in its entirety.
People who didn't appreciate that have not actually experienced life yet.
I haven't figure out all, yet, but the scene of Seymour, his therapist & his mother tells you more about how similar Seymour and Enid are... she moves to live with Rebbeca and when his life crashes she will go to live with her father...there are many questions yet...and that scene is realy GREAT, it helps you to understand a little bit more about the story...
The only thing that was lacking was the ending, i found it too symbolic, because it was saying that enids life had not yet begun and her getting on the bus was the start of her life- meh.
Thora Birch plays yet another teenage misfit, it's hard to tell if she's so good at it or if you're just used to seeing her in that role.
And yet despite being attuned to the world around her, she is naive in her way.
Earlier in the film, a customer moans at a video store clerk for not stocking Fellini's 8 Â½ (yet the store has the Kim Basinger sex film 9 Â½ weeks).
Ghost World (2001), by cult director Terry Zwigoff (Bad Santa (2003)) is aimed at the intelligent, open minded and cultured teenagers who are aware of what is ahead of them, yet choose to enjoy the life of a child and not wanting to grow up.
In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the "satanists" in the diner.
They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff, the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids, and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians, artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others, the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is, or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8Â½ which is even mentioned in this film.
I highly recommend any one who has not yet watched this episode to watch it.
"I find it so strange," she says, "that you two could be such close friends and yet not talk about someone as significant as a fiancÃ©e."
I'm hardly a historical expert on this, so I let them go mostly when I noticed them, assuming I was just ill-informed, and yet, they are somewhat advanced for the time period Holmes is and was intended to be set.
If you're a Montgomery fan who hasn't seen this yet, then put it on the top of the list, because it's a brilliantly moving film, and her performance is well done.
And yet, it does manage to convey just how those prison camps used other prisoners to operate the gas chambers, to carry out the deed with false promises--"Just be sure to remember where you hook the clothes so you can pick up your belongings when you leave"--and the backbreaking jobs of loading trucks with dead bodies and depositing them on chutes that go directly into a blazing furnace.
Being interested in the genre of Holocaust films I found this to be the most realistic yet.
this is the most impressive holocaust movie ever, If you have ever seen Shoa you'll agree .....  may you not be familiar with the ongoing events back in the 1940's in the death-camps maybe you should read into it before seeing this film  it's not like Uprising or Schindler's list (I haven't seen the Pianist yet but I very much doubt it'll come close)  this is the real stuff .....  MUST SEE 5 out of 5  
But, it left me feeling totally sad and depressed, yet I loved it and I'll recommened it to people.
And yet, it's a great story, well acted.
It's one of the very few films on the Holocaust I've seen that doesn't draw everything in black and white....what some of these men do to their fellow Jews is despicable, yet who amongst us can say that if he were hungry and desperate, he might not do the same.
Easily on par with Bend It Like Beckham, yet so different from other East/West films.
In a film which emphasized overacting, he probably has the sublest role, yet he still has the film's best over-the-top lines ("Assassination isn't worth the trouble.
This movie had such a cult following that although it's not listed here, and I have yet to see it, there was a Captain American 2.
It was unusual to see Ronny Cox as the president and Ned Beatty in yet another superhero movie!
Speaking of "rough," I can't think of too many actors who were better and more suited for noir than Sterling Hayden, who delivers yet another uncompromising hard-headed, tough- guy character.
Many of the best gags in the film are in the first half hour, including the bits with the planks of wood, and Keaton's gut-busting deadpan double take to yet another bizarre mishap, which had all of us laughing.
If one is new to Keaton, knowing only that he was a deadpan comedian who performed hilarious yet often dangerous stunts then this will be something of (in the words Oscar Hammerstein put into the mouth of the King Of Siam) a puzzlement; it boasts a more or less straightforward narrative in which engineer Keaton's train is stolen by Union troops during The War Between The States and he sets off in pursuit.
And it's a marvel how so many realistic, yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with.
Subtle yet violent, it gently and beautifully says a million things in single frames, single dialog, single sounds and visions.
If you're looking for a complex, intelligent, interesting, and faithful adaptation of a biblical story, turn the station or better yet, just read the Bible!
He starred in 20th's biggest production of 1954, "The Egyptian" -- after Marlon Brando turned down the part -- and then starred in this, MGM's biggest production of 1955, and yet this almost unprecedented, one-two whammy of multimillion dollar spectacles failed to ignite his acting career.
Funny how the film's budget was well under a million dollars, and yet it is has so much more heart and soul than the $150 million "Miami Vice."
Most of this film is in black and white and yet it is interspersed with bits of color and sometimes, briefly, in full color and the meaning of the color is unclear.
For those who have not yet had the pleasure, I can only hope that Robert will release this film to DVD or make it available for download on iTunes because in my opinion, it truly is a MUST SEE work of art.
Indeed, if you don't walk away from this film changed, heartbroken, and yet full of a renewed commitment to living life, you have no heart at all.
Budget was tight, filming was tense but he pretty much succeeded and the end result is an unconventional yet very enjoyable dark comedy.
The year after his sensational smash "Gremlins", Joe Dante brought us yet another fantasy about creatures unknown, and this time, places unseen as well.
Explorers is yet another gem from the criminally underrated Joe Dante.
the young actors really carry the film like old pros and Dantes direction choice of shots etc are yet again spot on.
This totally proves that the Yanks have very little taste (proved yet again by the success of Spider-Man) with this getting very poor reviews and virtually no box-office (I cant believe the amount of people who have said a film must be good because its made a load of money - two words - Pearl Harbor!
I recommend this movie to all Shakespeare loversÂ, a long time go I watched the movie made by Lawrence OlivierÂ, like tooÂ Keep in mind that this movie was done when cinema tricks, like editing or crosscutting, was yet not in use; so the way of filming is quite simple: they put the camera and shoot all the scenes in a medium shotÂ, there is only a brief shot closer to RichardÂ, reminds me all the movie the Frankenstein made by Edison in 1910.
At the time of writing, Toolbox Murders has not yet been released in either the US or the UK on DVD, which is somewhat inexplicable.
"Dis," or better yet, "Haze: A Love Story" is a very romantic and very dark film that has come to us all the way from Norway!
Here yet again Walter Pigeon plays the main part of invincible detective and is joined once more by his peculiar assistant Bartholomew known as the Bee-man (hilariously played by Donald Meek).
Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles.
All of these elements, make the film very easy to watch yet it doesn't leave you feeling indifferent.
Woody Allen was still in his first phase as a director, not having gone into his Igmar Bergmann period yet.
'Roberta (1935)' marked the third teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and, like 'Flying Down to Rio (1933),' it suffers from a studio oversight: RKO hadn't yet realized that Fred and Ginger were the main attraction.
Futurama has all the humour and heart of The Simpsons, yet it is so excitingly different.
People have flown to the edge of the universe (literally; there's a billboard and everything), created robots that run on alcohol, and turned the internet into a virtual reality realm, and yet lonely guys still rent porno on Saturday night.
If you haven't bought the DVD sets yet, look into them and see for yourself how great the show is if you haven't already.
"The Simpsons" has been endured for nearly two decades yet in all those episodes, you would be hard-pressed to find an equivalent number of memorable episodes as the far superior "Futurama" managed in its five seasons of existence.
Overall, Matt Groening achieved far more enjoyable television entertainment with "Futurama" than he has with "The Simpsons", yet the better show was cancelled.
The movie is filmed very good but yet very unusual.The music is good.
It's obvious that Van is head over heels in love with his wife yet (most notably in the Havana motel room scene) you can also see that he's fighting an attraction to Whitey.
The film offers no easy answers as to exactly why the events at Abu Ghraib unfolded as they did; yet, while it doesn't turn the individuals involved into easy-to-blame villains, it doesn't completely exonerate them either.
Are we yet, with pictures, unable to see the real abuses?
"Submarine X-1" and every other film of its kind belonged on the small screen or, better yet, on the big screen as propaganda films during 1943 or 1944.
Simple acting, yet still quite inspired by silent movies technique.
And yet these films were magic because they did not even try to look real, realistic.
His version of Sir Humphrey turns an average movie villain into a fascinating character, a repulsive yet lovable nut who elevates himself yet pushes down the little guy.
(The name might suggest exotic meridians; yet it is but a Cornish story about the barbarous deeds of the coast people.)
JAMAICA INN is a Gothic swashbuckler in a Victorian dress (--as a matter of fact, the 1820s, not quite yet the Victorian era--), a thundering Victorian show oozing with that peculiar brio of this director, a rogues melodrama; and a proof that the lesser Hitchcock is vastly preferable to others' accomplished outings.
Just watch the way Laughton does the most insanely despicable things and seems to have the most blasÃ© and yet innocently boyish fun doing it.
A more dreadful Hitch sound film I have yet to see.
But then the film has yet another surprise for us -- Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane.
), The Boss is really a somewhat Kane-ish look at the rise and fall of a lone wolf; Payne's tough yet touching performance lends an almost tragic tinge.
He's on the screen for about 10 minutes, yet steals the film from the brilliant performances of Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard etc.
There are entire scenes where Carol Reed focuses on the American whose alarming naivety produces some of the most hilarious yet, disturbing sequences that compliment the mystery.
She accompanies Holly throughout the film, and we expect an underlying romance to blossom, but yet in the end it does not - one of the many surprises of the film.
I guess to summarise, this Classic Album doco for me was made at such a poignant time in the career of Metallica, that it is a must have for any serious fan, as it provides so much insight into the past, the present, and most powerfully, what was yet to come.
After all the previous ones I've seen (havent seen 3 & 4 yet) this one I found the best.
Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet and want to be surprised.
Summary: Steven Taylor and Emily have been married for quite some time yet Emily feels trapped and controlled by Steven so she seeks comfort in the arms of David, a broke artist with a hidden past.
Steven knows about the affair yet Emily has no idea that he knows.
The movie is a great thriller yet it lacks....something.
Michael Douglas, the loving yet control freak husband Steven, whose empire is falling apart and the only option he has is to kill his wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who works for the UN, speaks a few languages but is dumb as a doorbell when it comes to the men in her life.
Without giving too much away, this film is very balanced; not overly optimistic, yet not too pessimistic either.
American forces haven't been fully deployed into the Vietnamese jungles yet, but Major Asa Barker is assigned to set up a barricade at an abandoned post at Muc Wa (where 10 years earlier 302 French soldiers were massacred by the Viet Cong), but at his disposal is only a few American soldiers and ragtag bunch of Vietnamese volunteer soldiers.
Equally crackerjack characterizations are contributed by Craig Wasson as a naive, soft-hearted raw recruit with romantic notions about the glory of war who quickly learns that war itself is an intrinsically ugly and unfair thing, Joe Unger as a foolishly gung-ho corporal, Jonathan Goldsmith as a frazzled, alcoholic, battle weary combat vet, Dennis Howard as an oblivious to the world dope-head, an especially chilling Evan Kim as brutish, bloodthirsty South Vietnamese mercenary Cowboy, Marc Singer in his film debut as Lancaster's loyal, yet cynical aide-de-camp, Dolph Sweet as Lancaster's stern, overbearing, overconfident superior, and James Hong as a helpful elderly villager.
Burt Lancaster is superb as the dedicated, yet tortured, soldier who must try to deal with a situation that he increasingly recognizes as being, at best, untenable.
Lon Chaney was without a doubt one of the best actors who ever lived and yet less than 50% of his filmography is left to judge him with.
Leonore accepts her fate to follow the family curse, yet Daniel won't allow her and reiterates his oath to protect her, in this life and the life after.
The plot and genre are hardly taxing and yet this is a real dog's dinner.
Lisa Kudrow's role is familiar, yet tragic instead of comic.
Though I wasn't even born yet to watch the original series when it was on, I did watch it in reruns on sci-fi a few years ago before they took it off the air.
No one has yet been able to identify which story that is, indicating the film either was going the Blair Witch route in trying to lend itself credibility, or else was conceived after hearing something about some man who tried to kill some naked girl somewhere.
This film is an effective, touching work that is mostly autobiographical, yet exaggerated to provide laughs and insight on the difficulties of show business.
If you can identify at all with this actress, you might come away with something of real horror and true fear - and yet have that fear without the chainsaws and other items of gore so frequent nowadays.
In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner.
Mike Jitlov sold his soul to devil for this film, the agent for the devil in this case was in this case Richard Kaye(the films producer) although this is yet to be confirmed.
A remake of an earlier film (THE FRONT PAGE, 1931), itself a film version of a 1928 play, HIS GIRL Friday was remade again as THE FRONT PAGE in 1976 and yet again in 1988 as SWITCHING CHANNELS, with Kathleen Turner nicely holding up in her portrayal of the role that cemented Rosalind Russell as a skilled comedienne, this time set in media TV.
The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely.
Sorry to make yet another comparison to the first film, but what made the first film stand-out is that the villains had depth and each one was unique.
It is a sincere work with suspense, you will pursue something that you don't know yet!
For those who have not watched this show yet, this anime is based on popular digital novel created by and amateur (refered as 'Doujin' in Japan)writer.
The story is told in 4 Question arcs and 4 Answer arcs (The last 2 aren't planned to come out in anime form as of yet).
Other than that the only place this movie belongs is in the garbage, or better yet, in a furnace........lol
If you think 50 cent's acting was horrendous then you haven't seen anything yet.
This is yet another rapper's feeble attempt at creating a semi "autobiographical" film about being a hardened drug dealer who does whatever he wants and gets away with it.
"American Graffiti" is the cinematic equivalent and homage to that easy-going yet troubled universe, superficial and profound, funny and deeply nostalgic.
I have not seen anything yet by her to indicate she is worthy of her status monetarily or with the media.
They are all on the verge of something great, but none of them know it yet.
All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)...
It has great, great humor, yet it leaves one with a bittersweet melancholia.
I dreaded watching it, yet could not look away.
He showed all the signs of wanting to give up the life, yet he did not.
The film is poorly shot and goes on for too long, yet it gets extra stars for its camp value today.
This was done without any special effects but with some basically simple yet tight screenplay.
The tone of the music set an uneasy mood, that was chilling yet sweet and this was the feeling I was left with.
A great supporting cast of Dennis Leary, Dana Delaney and Rosie O'Donnell (at her funniest, yet most reserved persona).
It's really nice to watch as her world comes tumbling down but yet she doesn't realize it because she's so in love and believes that the boy is her dead husband.
The adult actors in supporting roles, with Dana Delany and Denis Leary as Josh's parents and Rosie O'Donnell as the nun teacher, were decent yet understated as they, quite rightly, let the child actors shine.
Ryan Reynolds cocky yet confident attitude, portrayed in the movie, is hilarious!
yet the highlight of the production side of the film is the wonderful cinematography by Wilkie Cooper.
Unfortunately, even for a sufferable fan of the genre, this installment of the Texas Chainsaw series is just one more sell-out like the others, beginning with the birth of Leatherface and leading all the way to yet another cheese-ball ending.
The effectswork is terrific yet not overdone, fitting seamlessly into the storyline to visually tell the story of the horrors committed by this family, and the film is very well supported by the music score of Steve Jablonsky, who develops the atmospheric tonality developed for the 2003 remake and crafts a musical design that maintains a constancy of dread and a rhythmic, panic-inducing pulse during the action scenes.
Jablonsky's reprisal of Leatherface's theme is especially moving when he puts on the face of one of his victims, wearing the human mask (the "leather face") for the first time Â the score crescendos in a slow ascent of triumph, yet tinged with the horror relevant in that triumph.
The acting in the film is very good there are some very intense performances and some graphic scenes.It's shot very 70's slasherseque which overall gives it a creepy aura.The storyline is very easy to follow yet very disturbing and depressing at the same time.Overall fans of The Devil's Rejects and The Hills Have Eyes see Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning it's well worth the admission fee.
And yet for a film like This Is England, in which a much cruder relationship between a young boy and an older girl is explored ("you look like a four old, but kiss like a 40 year old!")
Frank is like "we have been working together for like 6 years but we have never go for a beer yet somehow you stole my wife", and we will see Frank apologizing more than once with that guy).
Then the search takes a good but yet a bad turn when Pacino (Detective Frank Keller) finds an interesting friend a very sexy and erotic type looking female played marvelously by the attractive Ellen Barkin.
A great premise that definitely justifies making yet another police procedural, this Al Pacino vehicle won this reviewer over, which is hard to do these days with cop thrillers - once you see enough they all start to look the same.
On yet another level, there was humorous stereotyping; no one is spared - everybody gets insulted here!
This adds yet more to the personal, emotional tone of the picture.
However, it is Kidman who yet again shows that she is one of the best actors of our generation.
The society is agrarian yet the farmers are poor mainly because of the fact that they have very small land holdings and they are unlettered.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read the following.
Finally a Dutch movie that dares to handle the subject of immigrants, in a fun and yet also critic way.
The acting is above average, although it's quite obvious that the Maroccan actors in this movie aren't very experienced yet, with the exception of Touriya Haoud maybe.
The movie is filled with some well known actors but yet all of the Marrocan characters are played by unknown actors.
Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.
So far in the Asian movie re-makes I have yet to see a movie that is as compelling in a thriller or a horror as the Asian version.
after that, this movie has a deep meaning, philosophical, and totally haunting (yet beautiful).
Kidman's performance is somewhat mannered, yet she completely, effortlessly inhabits a difficult role; it is a brave, piercing, bravura performance.
The era embodied a sort of innocence which dissipated towards the end of the decade and has sadly yet to return.
Murphy was rejected by the Navy and USMC, yet became our nation's most decorated veteran.
The performances are realistic and yet familiar to us veterans .
He achieved Hollywood star status with his tough yet tender persona.
Although there are a couple of scenes that drag on too long and some special effect errors, this film is yet another Fellini classic.
All occurs to be a dream, yet it is so powerful to feel this.
This movie worms its way into your own psyche in time - as with other Fellini movies, it seems to reveal scenes that are totally new and surprising, yet strangely familiar to me even though I've never seen them before.
That is, Soderbergh WASTES any possible context with his disruptive and alienated English-speakers, yet they are the only real help on offer.
I haven't seen many films since 2009 came, three visits to the movie theater before the one to see Che Part One (The Argentine) and of that three visits I had not really entirely pleasant experiences since Bedtime Stories is simply a bad movie, RocknRolla is just OK and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was not bad at all yet was not my cup of tea (certainly to read my entire opinion of those movies you can check my comments!).
So The Argentine was just my introduction to the work of Steven Soderbergh, yes I haven't seen sex, lies, and videotape (yet) and Traffic.
And yet here is the first controversy.
One important aspect in specific is analyzed: how armed and violent revolution necessates use of extreme force and judgment, and yet how humanitarianism can coexist within the same body.
At first glance, it isn't anything remotely special, and probably won't provide viewers with any degree of resonance if they are not interested in the man and his people's struggle beforehand, yet the same can be said for a number of similar features.
His insurgent, intense and convincing Che is one marred by crippling bouts of asthma yet defined by a burning desire to educate and reform- to put his litigious beliefs into action and unite Latin America.
As an avid Che fan and reader of his books and biographies, there is little doubt in my mind that this monumental work will stand as the first piece in the definitive two part screen portrait of one the twentieth century's most iconic, yet largely uncharted, political figures.
He is also reunited with his Django lead man, Franco Nero (here speaking for himself rather than being dubbed, which is very welcome), as well as having prominent Italian actor Tony Musante and Hollywood veteran Jack Palance on board for his most high-class line up yet.
But instead we got a good, yet dissapointing movie adaptation.
I can really not understand why this movie hasn't gotten a proper DVD release yet.
But, mostly it is not a buddy-buddy relationship, Nero is in it for the money, Paco is in it for the righteousness, yet they both respect each other.
I downloaded the end because I still havent got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
That it is more fable than fact is readily obvious, yet the fable is more than entertaining.
I downloaded the end because I still have not got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
A romantic, yet tragic story about the relationship between 3 sisters which would ultimately shape the future of China.
The youngest (played by Vivian Wu), who thought it was romantic of her sister to elope with Sun though life with him would have been very unstable, yet who had no qualms about standing by her husband in the quest for greater power.
It's funny yet realistic and touching as the former major league player becomes the most unlikely coach of a losing baseball team.
The hero is aloof, yet underneath that tough guy act is a vulnerable 17 yr old, who tries not to care about anyone and the heroine turns his world upside down!
It's worth watching this film again just to remind ourselves that only 30 years ago children still enjoyed some autonomous space in which to grow, and the iron doors of the Nanny State had not yet completely swung closed upon them.
Others have said that his switch from parasite to hero is unnatural, yet in the film the whole of his career and all of his qualities- good and bad- have been shown to be fitted- and only fitted at that time- for war.
With KCC, these seem _pastiched or quite borrowed (yet they are still functional and did not get the _movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract products)Âbut then again, such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema Â.
KANSAS Â has some of the ingredients of the noir (it is a rather pleasant surprise not to have a standard femme fatal); yet on the other hand, it seems a bit too selfÂaware, selfÂconscientious as a cool noirÂin a way that better movies (like DOA and SUDDENLY) are not.
These people want to say/intend to say the truth about many things, yet they end up in worshiping fake, phony images of wholly imaginary persons.
- Irvine Kinneas - a ladies man originally from Galabia Garden (Balamb Garden's rival Garden), and sharpshooter who soon has a thing for Selphie, yet secretly has a sensitive and caring nature.
It is his passion, yet he gives a critical and sometimes subjective opinion of the music at hand.
-***WARNING*** for those of you who have not seen this movie yet,this comment contains MAJOR SPOILERS.
Some of the characters are also reminiscent of the Gilligan's Island castaways such as the character of Lucille, who starts out as a snotty yet beautiful Ginger-type then turns into a fledgling Samurai under the hallucinogenic tutelage of a dead Japanese soldier because she just happens to be fluent in Japanese (as well as Vietnamese) and managed to translate the dead soldier's diary.
Just the opening graphics stunned me, and I hadn't even *started* the game itself yet.
I haven't quite finished the game yet (I started over 'cause I got confused over an aspect of the Guardian Forces, so I got to a battle that was impossible for me to win, and I couldn't get away from it.)
While the characters in the Dr. Kildare films are quite likable as is the dialog, a major problem in some of the early films in the series is that Kildare just doesn't behave very logically and yet the films work out in the end (sort of like Curious George, now that I think about it).
This movie is a basic cable CBS movie of the week, yet its trying to be hip, edgy and sexy, like an HBO/skinamax movie.
I was hoping the film would be more intense, yet Sneakers incorporates a lot of humor.
The characters are among the most realistic in any of these movies (with the exception of Joey the lamer in Hackers (1995) -- most accurate character in a hacking movie I've seen yet).
Compared to just about any other sci-fi show, even from its own era, Space: 1999 has probably the most terrible and obnoxiously inaccurate scientific content I've ever seen, and that includes the basic story (the moon sent hurtling through space at what must be sub-lightspeed, yet encountering new worlds and aliens in every episode).
You have the directors and stars , I would to see Sam Neill play a Barry Morse type character , or Tom Weller as a Tony Verdeshci type role and Zooey Deschanel as the Barbara Bain type character , haven't yet decided on the character of John Koenig , I think Christian Bale would be great as John Koenig .
You might think that you would get something steamy yet emotionally intriguing.
It reminded me of the scales of Justice which are finely weighed for both sides yet never truly balanced.
I don't want to spoil the movie for you, if you in fact am reading this but have yet to watch this movie.
It has never aired on any major national cable channel to my knowledge yet it was a major Paramount film and a big hit at the time.
Colbert's character is not only believable but strong yet vulnerable, too.
The ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, clichÃ©, and banal premise.
This is yet another reminder that Eddie Murphy used to make funny movies.
The characters are a little wet, particularly our soulless hero, yet Karen Mok's engaging sidekick Ying Ying is a worthy substitute, and the delirious spurts of action make the whole experience quite compelling.
Several fighting styles are apparent in the film, carefully rendered and presented in a way that wushu purists will feel vindicated, yet non-experts will be entertained.
The movie has a very determined yet tortured and guilt ridden Holmes make the ultimate decision of life or death for those he's been put in charge of on the overcrowded lifeboat.
He was powerful, yet torn all at the same time.
Better yet, the Star Trek episode "Darmok".
In attempting to implement the scheme, the two friends must first overcome violent opposition from the owner of a stagecoach line who stands to lose a cross-country mail contract if the plan succeeds, hostile Indians who see the advent of the white man as yet another encroachment to their way of life, and the California businessmen themselves whose interests extend beyond Californian independence.
), plentiful outbursts of gory violence (a grisly gamut from disembowelment to an arrow through the neck to a throat slicing to a hanging to a decapitation to ... well, you get the basic wall-to-wall nonstop graphic bloodshed idea; this baby's anything but dull and uneventful), painfully crummy "blurt the lines and grimace" pseudo-acting from a non-star cast, many uproarious obvious lapses in logic (e.g., the horrible thingofabobbits can be killed with mere water, yet reside under the Golden Gate Bridge and live in 'Frisco, a city which isn't famous for its dry, arid weather!
Hell, this gut-bustingly asinine fright flick clinker even comes complete with plenty of cheesy rock songs and one of those oh-so-80's "it ain't over yet!"
This is one of those little obscure and ridiculous yet fun horror movies from the eighties.The basics.Someone is going around committing horrid murders,turns out it's a gang of strange creatures that live underneath the Golden Gate bridge.What are these creatures?Why are they there?Well that is never answered.They are either humanoid or zombie looking.You have one that looks like a zombie solider,a weird apeman looking thing,a strange Native American monster and a few others.It also just so happens these creatures can be killed with water(why would something that is endangered by water live under a bridge?
I think the main reason is because since the main characters acted so stupid yet nice, you could kind of relate with them and feel closer to them, which means more laughs.
The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying.
Usually mimes can be a little irksome (maybe not, depends on who's miming and how well the audience can take it), but Alejandro Jodorowksy, in his first attempt at film-making, makes this as experimental as something like Un Chien Andalou yet with an emotional core that can be understood by viewers open to it all.
For all of you that say this movie is not funny, you must be crazy, this is the best comedy ever, with the best performances in the careers for daniels and jim carrey if you haven't seen this movie yet go out right now and movie i promise it wont dissapoint
There are many more things which no director yet mastered to show properly.. it is to do with the "feel" of timing.
and yet I have seen a totally different playing role from Bruno Ganz in Vitus: A Grandpapa who loves his grandson and are best friends.
This my friends is a crying shame, they release violent, hate filled films in 2000 theatres,  VITUS is a simple but yet complex tale of a child prodigy, a musical genius,whose IQ is 180.
Here, it's more than clear from the death of the Asian girl at the start like a martyr to the Asian evil guy who turns out to be an honest friend after all, and a criminal yet with a heart of gold (suits perfectly a 1995 movie !).
I wasn't really expecting anything great on account on any of these things, but what I wanted to see was some good action and yet it failed even there.
Different than being nun or monk which requires leaving mainstream society and living in the monastery with prayers, last step of this difficult and lengthy process of purifying one's soul from earthly desires, is to be able to return to the real world after so many years lived in contemplation and yet not being disturbed with its appeal to commit sin.
Yam is easily an underrated actor, whose talent is still yet to be recognised within the HK Films Award.
While the Black Cat succeeds in being trashy yet entertaining, it is once again another case of what could have been.
Have we not all met people like him - obsequious, yet trying so hard to be the perfect concierge?
If you haven't seen it yet, don't wait any longer.
OK, I haven't read all the comments yet but I was kinda disturbed of the low rating this movie got.
I've read a lot of Lovecraft in my time and haven't seen a film yet that "accurately" portrays any of his "monsters" very well, except for perhaps this film.
If you're a Lovecraft fan & you've not seen this yet it's worth checking out.
Alas, we have yet to see a really good treatment of any Lovecraftian tale on film.
Stockwell gives the role a creepy yet seductive intensity.
However, this movie has a great little gem at the beginning with its animated title sequence and theme, which is so different and eerie, yet rockin' at the same time.
For those who haven't yet indulged further, Grigori Chukhrai's 'Ballad of a Soldier' is a good introduction: more universal, less political, not as formally difficult, and quite a bit more fast-moving (demonstrated, quite literally, by sped-up shots of a tank near the beginning!)
Has anyone seen the DVD version in the stores yet?
A good half (if not more) of Russian films deal with what Russians term the Great Patriotic War, and yet precious few of them are so profound and universally understood as Grigory Chukhrai's classic.
why in god's name would you leave your colonies unguarded, when you haven't signed a treaty yet.
Their relationship is tumultuous yet committed, with tender embraces, screaming fights and tickling kisses.
The fights are real and true to the art... revealing an ancient, yet rarely (if ever) seen denomination of high-precision Kung Fu....
Britney Spears provided the best one-line plot description imaginable for this film: Not a Girl, Not yet a Woman.
A truly ravishing and often barely dressed minor literally offers herself at this potent, thirty-something guy, and yet there are no explicit sex sequences or gratuitous insinuations being made.
For those who have not yet seen it, one word of advice.
It's both unexpected in some parts yet quite predictable in others.
The role is played with subtlety, and some stiffness, by John Hodiak, I think because he is meant to be eternally confused by events (since he remembers nothing) and yet can't show his confusion, so he draws up a blank face.
The boy is not yet jaded in the grown-up fashion, and the people he meets stir him into immediate sympathy, Alyosha is simply one of the most likable characters you will encounter in a film, without being trite or cutesy.
Ballad of a Soldier, of course, aims to present Russian soldiers in the best possible light yet Chukhraj does not hesitate to show his characters as real human beings with flaws.
This is how I broke into music just by improvisation without any knowledge or technical skills yet making what I felt into music.
Although this film plays well to a broad audience, it is very mystical and based on simple, yet emotional themes that will play flat to some movie-goers.
In fact they know him for more than 10 years, yet nobody knows that he is the son of the second villain that is supposed to be dead.
Despite splinters of wooden dialogue and the obvious, yet ultimately satisfying, use of the music of Van Morrison early in the proceedings, the movie moves past both and bowls audiences over with poignant performances and stunning visuals in a first-class production.
He goes way overboard in virtually every area, yet somehow it works to the film's benefit!
Meiko Kaji is stunning as the cold blooded yet high sympathetic character of lady snowblood.
Henry Kray is embittered by the politicization of his life, yet we see him beginning to hope against his experience that the feelings Anthony shows him might possibly be real.
The lead male characters are unquestionably homosexual without being explicit yet without losing their sexuality and none of the gay men die of aids nor are they HIV positive.
If you thought that 'Little Red Riding Rabbit (1944)' was an offbeat adaptation of the fairy-tale, then you haven't seen nothing yet.
Somebody must have forgotten to inform Avery that he was producing cartoons for children, since there's actually little to laugh at for anybody who isn't yet acquainted with the birds and the bees.
The talent involved - Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, Crispin Bonham Carter, Benjamin Whitlow and the wonderful Barbara Leigh-Hunt on the acting side, Jane Austen on the writing side, and the BBC on the production side - almost guarantees a quality production, but as this is, in my opinion, the best Austen dramatization yet to appear on film or television.
He knew what Elizabeth thought of him(or if he didn't, he had a pretty good idea) and yet he still pursued her.
I have yet to meet anyone of either sex who hasn't become a fan of the movie after watching it, and even my cousin Guy, who's a bit of a modern-day Neanderthal, throws out a Lady Catherine quote now and again.
The humour is carried throughout the film with great subtlety, yet one cannot help but burst out loud in laughter - triggered by no more than a well-timed piece of dialogue... or lack of it!
He is believable as a proud and yet good hearted Englishman.
He showed just the right amount of emotion and yet he made the viewers understand his feelings.
Both have to do much acting without expressing much if at all, yet Ehle brings a nice iconoclastic attitude towards her character, the same way Firth embodies masculine arrogance.
The actors are awesome - Colin Firth is and will be the one and only Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle was a wonderful Elizabeth - spirited, lively, yet still always within decorum ( only that her skirts were " 6 inches deep in mud, I assure you").
The movie works very efficiently and elegantly with flashbacks to tell the various sub-plots, yet remains focused on the main actions.
Similarly Jennifer Ehle excellently portrays Lizzie, showing her to be tender, witty, thoughtful, occasionally prone to strong judgments without all the information, yet trying to grapple with different feelings as her involvement with Darcy, et al., progresses.
Alison Steadman's histrionics and fickle opinions are wonderful as the mom, and remind me very much of an actual relative of mine, while Benjamin Whitrow is a great counterpart as the father who is outwardly usually calm and peaceful, yet always able to rile up his wife.
I don't know yet if I loved it, but I definetely liked it alot.
The CGI computer effects are poor, the supergator itself looks OK but it isn't animated that well & every time it attacks someone a fake puppet head & jaws are used & there are close-ups of it's blood stained mouth & teeth yet when the film switches back to the CGI supergator it's mouth & teeth are perfectly clean.
Boy was I wowingly wrong (Couldn't be a word, yet but I think it will be) Story was good, effects and the writing of this were stupid..
When they just saw Mr. big gator but yet how would they not hear him circle where they were..?
Were shown at the beginning of the movie that Lyles has been suffering from a sever case of claustrophobia since he was in Vietnam but yet he managed to get into the LAPD where, being assigned a deadly weapon, he may very well be put in tight places where his phobia would take over his common sense.
The Choirboys is Aldrich at his very worst Â if you thought The Grissom Gang and Hustle were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet!
Silent Hill 3 remains the coolest Silent Hill game yet, Silent Hill 4 remaining the stupidist.
It's about as long as the first one(in general, it takes a bit of inspiration from it... including in a way that I'd have preferred it didn't, but I understand that others did want that; you should definitely try to play the original one before this, you will appreciate it on another level), but the well-done puzzles seem simpler(that, or I'm getting better... and I tend to think it's the former, not the latter; meanwhile, this has the greatest riddle-solving system yet), if there may be about the same amount of them.
I wasn't bothered by the gender in the least, and her personality isn't irritating(I've yet to come across a single obnoxious person in this franchise up to this point); however, her vocabulary, well, fits her age, and it does take away from the mood when something is called/described using words like "boring", "gross" or "yuck".
It's all so abandoned, so close to quaint, and yet absolutely not.
Or better yet, why any decent person would ever rent, let alone buy, this piece of utter garbage.
The film's main focus is on two brothers, Nicola and Matteo Catiti whose personalities are as different as night and day yet is also immediately apparent that these two love each other very much.
Special occasions occur, yet none are given any special attention.
The events that occur are important for that moment in time, yet one pass become mere memories such is the case of life.
I could not touch them, or talk to them, yet they seemed to welcome me with open arms as I silently watched their lives unfold before me.
The success of this movie is a proof that we haven't forgotten our emotions yet.
The power of this film lies in its ability to touch important issues in a subtle way without didactic fireworks.The script is realistic yet with a poetic flair, the quality of photography is supreme and the actors ARE the Carati's.
"Best of Youth" combines charismatic acting, leisurely directing amidst beautiful scenery in several parts of Italy with writing that takes the trajectories of complex yet consistent characters' lives believably and searingly affected by uniquely Italian experiences of the baby boomers' young adult years through middle age, without the American tendency to reject or regret youthful ambitions, through the lens of local natural disasters, violent political activities, judicial battles against the Cosa Nostra, European economic changes, with regional variations, that Americans rarely see in movies.
I can only sum up two points: it is an excellent yet easy-going overview of recent Italian history, and a truly moving, in an unbanal and unstereotypical, unpopcorny way, movie about the value of friendship, closeness, family.
When the violence began, the good General tried to get the United Nations to intervene, yet the United Nations felt strangely helpless and for a variety of complicated reasons, did nothing.
It's amazing to see how no one responded to this crisis and yet quickly responded to what was happening in Yugoslavia.
There is so much tragedy that takes place in the world involving the military and others involved in physical conflict, yet it is rare that a soldier comes forward to tell the truth.
You know right off the bat that she fancies him, yet they are to some degree enemies throughout the middle, then she suddenly cares about him again and helps him, and then they are passionately in love by the end.
For instance, the writer and director were on one hand clearly making a mockery out of some things (i.e, King Charles), yet on the other hand they seemed to shed a more serious light on other things (i.e., the importance of the role of the actor and the acting process).
***Please be warned my review contains spoilers - If you haven't seen the film yet, please stop reading now***   I was drawn in by several factors - the disintegration of Julie & Henry's relationship; the illness and impending death of their son; the mystical, magical "healer" character; the ensuing relationship between Julie & Alexei.
If you haven't seen this film yet, do so, it's a great experiences.
Anyway, again, I loved the movie and I will definitely see it yet again!
Lothaire Bluteau is also quite brilliant, presenting the almost sheepish, yet amazingly gifted Alexy with a natural charm and ease.
Ned may not yet know who or even what he is, but he finds expression of his innermost being with a person who loves and accepts him for whomever he may turn out to be.
Worse yet, Johnny's vain struggling actress mother Denise (nicely played by Sandy Reed) and hard-working insurance salesman stepfather Phil (a strong and likable performance by Renny Roker) spend more time squabbling with each other than they do with Johnny.
If you haven't watched it yet, please do so before reading anything else.
As you can see, I have seen this movie only once, yet I can remember half the ridiculous things in it with such accuracy!
The movie goes by quick, I am guessing they knew it was not an award winning masterpiece or anything so keep it short and simple and throw in a really strange yet catchy theme song to really get the audience going.
Still, you have some interesting things to see here, there is action and you get to watch as they just launch a super powered jet as an explosion occurs cuing yet another round of that strange song that is most highly energetic.
Plus the theme song runs over the end credits and Pak displays his gymnast skills during the stirring climax... saving Yor yet again!
Which by the way is a film I strongly urge anyone who hasn't see it yet to do themselves a favor and go and rent it right now.
Its funny cause at a glance the story appears to be a "light" and somewhat comedic little story, yet before you know it, the story ventures into dark dark territory.
Or better yet, try three films in one.
Fruit handled it very well, I have yet to see the full cut of the short but it leaves me wanting to know more.
Worth getting or at least renting if you are a fan of any of the directors,or if you want to see something relatively fresh from cultures whose clichÃ©s and conventions haven't worn out their welcome in the Occident.At least not yet.
Written by Fruit Chan, Chan ÂWook Park and Takashi Miike they each have their own 45 minute slot to make you cringe with fear yet cannot turn away, three films entitled 'Dumplings', 'Cut' and 'Box'.
Coupled with some great comic lines and action, this proved to be a turn in the right direction, considering this film showed a different side of Harry which we had not seen yet.
I have already submitted this comment to IMDb for correction, but haven't seen anything yet.
Overall, this is yet another violent, tough-minded and vastly entertaining "Dirty Harry" flick that is a must-see to Callahan-fans and highly recommendable to all action-lovers.
Just a woman who loved a man enough to marry him, yet in both films she becomes a victim.
It wasn't her fault that Irene Dunne (Ellen) wasn't dead yet she is treated so rudely and offhandedly that I found it irritating and frustrating.
The cast is marvelous, topped by yet another Oscar-worthy performance by Irene Dunne, who offers a multi-dimensional portrayal in a genre where one-note characterizations typically run rampant.
This movie is one of the best renditions of "a Christmas carol" that i have ever seen, and yet most people have never heard of it!
When i was watching this film i thought that it was going to be yet another failed Britsh attempt at movie making, how wrong was I.
All in all this movie is yet another movie of the times, yet don't dismiss it because of the violence; dismiss it because it just isn't that good!
The Firefly family is yet another riff on the inbred sickos of Hooper's seminal masterpiece crossed with the mountain loonies of "The Hills Have Eyes"Âbut whereas the characters in those films gave naturalistic performances (that made them seem all the more real), Zombie writes dialog like an invitation for histrionics from his C-listers; Moseley spends most of the film screaming his lines; Moon's helium-inflected voice is irritating; and Karen Black's over-the-hill slut routine is embarrassing.
One thing, i'm sure about, that there was another policeman who didn't die yet, (the one with the white barb).
I'm now sorry I missed "The Escapist" at Sundance which has also not yet been released commercially this side of the Atlantic.
The feeling of unfulfilled desires by this isolated young woman are magnified as she watches her newspaper reporter neighbor Jasper Black (Ewan McEwan) across the street escorting yet another tipsy dolly into his apartment.
I'll give you one, it's the emotional motivation to sense the woman's despair and loss through the beach,the sea and the yelling-mommy kid ,better yet we were forced to feel the one-dimensional space these characters occupied.
This story is very sad and yet it has a great story about love between a man and a woman who know they will be Soul Mates forever no matter what happens to them in life.
Isn't it amazing that the crystal laser beam can blast through windows, yet reflect from Matt's rear-view mirror.
I caught this on Turner Classic Movies, during a showcase of movies that are not yet available on video.
Made right after the splendidly schlocky "Galaxy of Terror," this choice cheesy chunk of early 80's sci-fi/horror drive-in exploitation junk rates as yet another lovably low-rent two-cent Roger Corman gem.
This episode is shot entirely inside one room, and yet never becomes dull or uninteresting.
Gladys Cooper is excellent in the lead role; delivering a performance that is both abstract, yet believable at the same time.
Supple and ethereal editing, yet put the entire thing together, and it doesn't make much sense at all.
The comments on this film to date are some of the most intelligent and knowledgeable I have yet to read anywhere on the imdb site.
Why does this tale (awash in sentimentality in Francis Hodgson's book of the same name) - yet LIVE ON?
"Vacation for a Massacre" is yet another in the long string of (mostly Italian) films that noticeably imitate the 1972 US megahit "Last House on the Left", and this film by Fernando Di Leo (director of the infamous "Slaughter Hotel")is certainly one of the best.
An incredibly well crafted, visually stunning film with a really subtle yet powerful soundtrack made for one of the better documentary films of the year.
Beautifully styled shots and a sparse yet rich sound design leaves you feeling emotionally drained by the end.
I love his ability to be so arrogant and yet so witty and convincing.
This film should be quite an interesting pairing with the 1987 film, "The Doctor and the Devils" because both films deal with the same themes yet change in certain ways.
The film has a very creepy, chilling Gothic atmosphere, and yet it accomplishes to seem frighteningly real.
What a wild-romp, and yet what a chilling-parable of the abuses-of-power in a rotten-era of human-history.
that's why i love john waters, and hopefully he'll read this and create the most ugliest movie yet and i'll be in love with him more...
While her fellow housewives are cooking dinner and cleaning the house, Beverly R. Sutphin is out dispatching people that have got on hers and her family's nerves in a variety of nasty, yet hilarious, ways.
Her kids think it's cool, and her husband is duly worried...  Kathleen Turner takes the lead role, and does an excellent job of performing in a serious, yet jokey way; which does the film no end of favours on the parody front.
Kathleen Turner, alternating between dizzy, unquestioning devotion to her family and clinically cool, yet psychotic anger to offending neighbours, either appears to possess a martyr's yellow halo above her head, denoting divine lightness and freshness, or a focussed smile as she carefully contemplates her next victim.
If you are on the lookout for some perfectly vibrant, yet malicious black comedy, subscribe to "Serial Mom", one of the most ruthless, patronising skits on good manners and nosey, voyeuristic neighbours ever to hit the screen.
If you haven't seen it yet, and you like Altman's other movies, this is a definite must-see.
Maximilian Schell's rather good acting is wasted in his predictable yet nonsensical role.
It's a great story and I don't understand why it isn't on video yet.
The film tries to convince us that his plant would have been forced out of business if he had rejected them, and yet at the same time shows us that his business was booming during the war.
This movie was made more than 60 years ago yet it transcends time.
Even for a film world that had not yet descended into the long night of the "Black-List".
The son of the jailed partner, played in rather stiff fashion by HOWARD DUFF, is unforgiving when he realizes Robinson shared the guilt with his father and yet let his father take the blame for the incident.
And how parents haven't tried to ban this show yet.
Then there's Mandy, the cute little spawn of Satan, yet more evil than the Grim Reaper, which is weird.
It's not more important than any other, yet Professor Keating selfishly arrogates to himself the task of molding the character of these boys, as if the other teachers were all just dopes.
And like Emperor's Club, both teachers, although leaving their intangible, yet indelible mark on the young men they taught, are shown to be quite weak and naive in matters of the world and politics.
Todd has no dialogue throughout, yet Hawke's portrayal is so skillful that you see everything he is feeling, and the buildup to his outburst.
This is a movie with an unhappy, yet satisfying ending.
), yet the story itself mocks the film's supposed intentions.
Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.
If you have not watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now.
No big budget, no known actors, and yet it was one of the best scary movies I've ever seen.
There has yet to be a definitive movie on this topic.
What a great cast of character parts-- plug-ugly psycho Jack Lambert all wrapped up in ice and apparently loving it; Fatso Zero Mostel auditioning as an assassin but serving as a kick-me doorstop instead; and a menacing Bob Steele brandishing a revolver instead of his usual six-gun, along with such familiar yet unsung faces as police chief Roy Roberts and detective King Donovan who gets an unscheduled face wash and without a towel.
At the time of writing this i have yet to have it confirmed, but it's thought that this Bretaigne Windust directed picture is the first mainstream picture to deal with the complexities of organised crime?, certainly the dialogue is now common speak (courtesy of Martin Rackin (Riffraff (1947)), but back in 1951 it surely would have raised eyebrows and intrigued the watching public.
What five-year-old child at any time in the last forty years would be unable to interpret 'contract' and 'hit' when encountered in the context of a thriller/noir/caper/gangster movie yet here, in 1951, both hard-bitten detectives and an Assistant District Attorney are as bemused as Hoosier tourists hearing Urdu for the first time whilst on vacation in the sub-Continent.
Bogie is, it must be said, strangely subdued as yet another D.A.
Let me say from the start that it is FANTASTIC... a tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet proportions, and yet utterly hilarious; a western, and yet set in fifties' Thailand; technically superb and yet filled with pastiches of movie cliches; tongue in cheek and yet very moving.
It is also anachronistic, as there are cars available yet most use horses.
It's all very clichÃ©d and yet strikingly original (I half expected a Brokeback angle).
And now, in the future, which appears to be the 50's, maybe,it's hard to pinpoint a time-frame in this film, Rumpoey has been promised to Kumjoorn, a police captain, and yet she does not love him.
I haven't laughed out loud so much since SHAOLIN SOCCER, yet secretly really caring about what was going to happen to the characters.
Have I mentioned the colour yet?
Shootouts are frequent and bloody, yet wholly unrealistic.
So beautiful, so sad.If you have not seen it yet, please do so.
Steiger's performance is at once theatrical (while contained enough not to descend into the ham of later roles) yet convincing - and the existence of similar fraudsters like Robert Maxwell only adds to the credibility.
(Her tenuous claim to fame is her preposterous, yet mesmerizing perf in Stroheim's MERRY WIDOW.)
This delightful little comedy is a fascinating glimpse of the first days of the Jazz Age with a never more charming Mae Murray who practically cannot stand still and gives a sweet, amusing performance and then there's the stunningly handsome Valentino, then not yet a star but certainly showing star charisma in spades.
Great topic for a movie, yet in this case the end result falls dismally short of what it could have been.
Worse yet, the entire movie is based on the same old stereotypes typical of patriotic Hollywood war movies copied time and again, in this case all put together in an inflated, unrealistic and grotesque jumble.
Plain, simple and yet astonishing... Perhaps I understood her because I come from a country that lives of small rituals like Spain does.
It was also fun to watch one of Rob Lowe's brothers in yet another B horror picture.
Sort of defies all the laws of probability, yet it happens all the time in flicks of the era.
Well, there isn't...at least not yet, Steven Spielberg is about to produce it in 2009 or 2010.
Everything within a 300 yard radius in all directions (including up and down) is completely and utterly destroyed, yet the survivors can stand a few inches farther away and suffer no blast effects, no radiation effects at all.
I know this ISN'T the opinion of everyone--so if you LIKE when he tugs at your heartstrings and helps a damsel in distress (yet again), then you'll be thrilled.
Enter the little tramp, broke and starving, yet always managing to get by, this time, secretly fed by a babe in arms.
The Circus is yet another gem from the greatest comic filmmaker of the silent era and a subtle hint of the masterpiece to follow.
'The Circus (1928)' was one of the few Charles Chaplin features that I was yet to see, but that wasn't from lack of trying.
Nikki was Willy's new boss in the prestigious law firm--yet we have scenes where she is supposed to have gone to bat for him with someone in the law firm, so obviously she did not have total and final say.
Hopkins kills his wife with a well-thought out, yet highly unlikely plot, which is only believable because Hopkins' character is so intelligent.
Anyone who hasn't seen it yet really should.
He didn't add anything new to his character that we haven't seen him do before, yet I still loved watching him whenever he was on the screen.
I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance.
It was all about him doing what he does best(acting real, tough, and yet vulnerable) McQueen is one of the last old school action movie star who possessed such a qualities.
It is sad for America that they just don't make them like McQueen anymore, I can only imagine/dream about how he would be developed as an actor if he didn't pass, and yet making The Hunter would be greatest thing for his last standing......
Directed in a rather plain, yet still effective manner by TV show veteran Buzz Kulik, this movie has a certain rough look and gritty atmosphere to it that's gripping and believable.
This story entwines the deepest of human (and not so human) emotions in a cruel yet truthful way.
The series wants the viewer to sympathize with the life-ruiner Lucy, yet the best they could do is have her witness her dog's death as a child and expect that to be reason enough to side with a murderer from now on?
I mean, come on..  Then there's the moronic Kohta who does little more than act as bland as he can before the onset of his next little flashback to yet another oh-so-cleverly concocted plot device - Lucy killing his father and sister when he was a child.
Elfen Lied is a little Japanese jewel XO I'm waiting for the second season (hoping that there will be one... but the end seems to say us "ha ha ha, it's not yet the end!!!")
Well ask yourself this; Is there anything else out there that can lay claim to being disturbing and yet at the same time profoundly beautiful?
I have yet to watch it.
And if you are a fan of great anime with great background music that is totally contradictory yet totally appropriate to the series, then you have your helping in "more than you can eat" servings.
If you haven't seen it yet, even if you hate anime, see this movie.
This is an off-beat yet charming feminist comedy with a deft dialogue and great photography.
A poignant yet everlasting drama of love and the power of compassion and humanity.
Nandu and Anand are members of society, yet only ostensibly, yearning for the compassion that their families fail to provide them, and in search, they come to Pushpa, whose abundance of love and human sympathy far overshadows her disreputable social standing.
They alone see her inner beauty, while society maligns her, yet as the director points, cannot provide the qualities of love, happiness and tranquility for members like Nandu and Anand.
Samanta succeeds in creating a cynical presentation of society as one that compels people to stay within the confines of its social institution of family yet cannot provide for the very emotional, and spiritual ingredients that constitute it.
This film tackled a theme that was very much taboo in Indian Cinema, and succeeds in presenting a mature, yet never over-the-top, nor didactic story that ultimately every Indian household can identify with.
The music is an absolute delight and adds to the melancholic yet redemptive nature of the relationship between the three protagonists.
Benny had yet to come up with the idea.
Werner Herzog mounts his camera on a helicopter and takes us through the desolate landscape of Kuwait's oil fields yet there's no politics involved, no topical Gulf War content.
And eventually what starts out as just simple, yet spatially complex, aerial takes on the tattered fields, turns into an act of seeing ruin and something that would seem incredible in an objective frame of reference.
I went in with low expectations and yet I was still disappointed because it doesn't even classify as typical mindless action-type fun such as "Bloodsport" and the like.
I am surprised he is not famous yet.
Its different to Mainland UK life, yet recognisable.
and this role is yet another proof of his acting skills.
Ashely is perfect in her role as drama queen but yet again Lucas stole them all the show.
Vanessa evens the score for a lack of character to play by snatching the best song - yet again.
Losing yourself in search of something you don't really need, not yet anyway.
But in all honesty, I would have to say that if you have not seen this movie yet, go see it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
The clinch for me, was the fact that the protagonist's motives were NOT motivated by any lofty political idealism or love of humanity, but entirely financial... And the unsurprising, yet nonetheless stunning, twist at the end will surely put this movie in it's rightful place in Hollywood history.
Even courts in the old Soviet Union might flinch at such a brow-beating--and yet her lawyer never objects and the judge seems content to preside over a sham of a hearing!
After the competent yet totally un-necessary Red Dragon, Ratner's moved on to After the Sunset, which at first glance looks like a high-tech crime caper, but grows into a fairly adult, mature character study, not unlike Tarantino's Jackie Brown.
It's not up to the standard of Oceans's eleven yet it beats the likes of Ocean's 12.
I must say that the film certainly does not lack plot points Â there are many plots to the story, yet when it was all over it still felt somehow anticlimactic, due to the unrealistically up-beat ending.
His was such an interesting character, yet was given limited screen time.
Better yet, the actors portraying them are mostly brilliant.
The actors are committed to their work, the story is believable, yet uncommon enough (to many people) to be appealing.
I will admit I have not yet watched this movie as an adult/parent.
This story is luckily funny and entertaining, with well-used CGI yet again.
And yet, they went on and released it?!
I had expected mafia-type action but instead I was treated with a fantastic yet dark world of betrayal and blood and an excellent black comedy.
If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time or money.
(of course I have yet to sit through Plan 9 from Outer Space)  I kept waiting for some sort of story to emerge that I could relate to on some level, but that never happened.
It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of "Titanic" has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as "Gangs" yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of "Titanic" is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor.
These characters have no role to play in the story, yet they show up from time to time as if only to have something to fill the 2 and a half hours of the movie.
And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts?
And yet, Scorsese tries.
At one point, the film effortlessly demonstrates how immigrants were drafted right off the boats as they had a suitcase from a foreign country one moment, and an American Uniform the next practically unable to speak the English language, yet ready to wage war against an unknown enemy.
The original story by Jay Cocks (The Age of Innocence) has been filtered by Kenneth Lonergan (Analyze This) and Steven Zaillan (Hannibal) and contains the conventional pratfalls of Hollywood Cinema such as double crosses and plot twists, yet they are thankfully kept to a minimal.
In this film, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) commences the war immediately as he slices and dices his way through the street enmeshed in a series of direct stab wounds yet no blood, but as he progresses and continues his assault, the knives are introduced as blood soaked, then the puncture wounds are accentuated as he pierces his way through flesh and finally we see his face saturated in the blood of others against the intentionally misplaced musical score of Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy).
I have to admit to those who have not yet seen it that "Gangs" is quite violent.
In conclusion, if you have not seen this movie yet, go.
If you want my advice, OK, watch any Brazilian movies, you won't be disappointed, about argentina, I don't know yet, I can only tell you, stay away from "Burnt money", unless you are into gay films of course.
The regime is sexually repressive yet one finds sexual tension relieved at every turn.
Alan Parker, the director, has adapted the T. Coraghessan Boyle's book into a hilarious comedy that evidently, judging from some of the comments to this forum, is not a crowd pleaser, yet, the film rewards those with an open mind to enjoy this hysterical take of a mad scientist, a spa, and the people that tend to patronize those places.
You know he's a bad guy, yet you're struck by his intelligence and charisma.
He had spent a decade in action pictures and romances, with an occasional comedy thrown in for good measure, and yet had not achieved major stardom.
The screen may not be vivid, yet the special effects have an ethereally surreal quality.
We never get to see Earth, yet we get a glimpse of what humans are like from the interactions of the crew (work, entertainment, nutritional intervals, exercise, reproduction and crisis).
yet Aranda gives them a personal touch.
Of course the whole thing, like all the other Chris Guest films, is a mostly improvised riff on some American institution with many laughs and bizarre yet recognizable characters.
Stand-outs in that department include Higgins as the uptight, militaristic publicist Corey; Willard as the bombastic TV host with a "faux" Mohawk, with the plastic Lynch, smiling sweetly--and completely insincerelyÂby his side; and Coolidge as yet another dumb, hat-wearing, push-up bra-strapping blonde who delivers some of the funnier lines in the movie.
The characters are still quirky and amusing in a subtle way, yet something is off.
Best one yet of the Japanese series on the technical craftsmanship side of things.
Harry Shearer gets his best showcase yet as the put-upon Victor whose mouthy agent Morley Orfkin refuses to take his calls until the buzz hits them.
I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews here for what I thought was in many ways Christopher Guest's most developed movie yet.
In yet another variation of his "Poppy" role from his Broadway hit of the 1920s, Fields here plays Larson E. Whipsnade, owner of a circus.
He has the loose-hipped walk of a younger Robert Downey, Jr., yet oozing even more with suggestiveness.
And yet the film reaches a climax we've seen so many times.
It can be difficult to endure, since many things in the film fall into the category of "Something I would never do," yet watching it is like seeing a train wreck; chilling and disturbing, but you just can't turn away from it.
It's inconceivable to think of a love surviving amidst chaos, yet explicitly evident by the film's conclusion are two characters gleefully and explicitly demonstrating their devotion; a scene where the two burn the money that they stole, and that which their pursuers are after.
And yet we all live in the fallout from that of that failure without really understanding it.
Every film of his is completely unlike the others, and yet they all have his unmistakable stamp.
The main character suffers severe injury to his head and hand from a relative fender bender, while walking away from a car accident in which the car he is in, going at full tilt down an expressway, flips over a median and land upside down hitting another car, which then causes them both to blow up within a matter of seconds...  yet he escapes unscathed...
And yet, Besson's employees failed to deliver anything more than middle-of-the-road of half-baked products.
Some of the stunts were simplyÂstunning; in fact, I just had to re-view Â again and again Â the last car chase with the most spectacular head-on impact I've yet seen.
You haven't seen Bullit yet...?
dirty jobs) to make sure such ops will be deniable if discovered; agents being betrayed by their own hierarchy for reasons of "higher national interest"; the dirty tricks spy agencies of yet allied countries do to each other; and more specifically to the DGSE, the rivalry between the military officers (represented by Cassel, Bellucci and the Colonel played by Andre Dussollier) and the civilian technocrats (represented by the no-name black-haired cigarette-smoking guy in his early forties played by Bruno Todeschini), the former ones having lost control of the agency to the latter over the years (the DGSE was originally run by the French military).
In "Replacements", the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life.
More importantly, you can't help but feel sorry - and yet almost envious - for the doomed (and did I mention beautiful?)
Young children might find the pace off-putting (even at 82 minutes, there are lots of slow spots) and maybe a little too eerie, yet older kids and animation buffs should find this movie to be of interest.
Since this happy young couple receive -- yet laugh off -- a warning about wandering the woods alone, it is certain that something bad will happen.
And yet, Noriega and Sbaraglia are ultra-convincing as the macho thugs who would literally die for one another, and they invest every gesture, every inflection, with genuine romantic chemistry.
Have they found the meaning of life yet?
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
I won't spoil the story since I think it deserves to be seen, but they managed to give a true picture of very particular yet totally second-rate lives.
Besides having to survive the avalanche Johnny & his buddies also have to contend with the Ice Queen who kills on sight...  Co-edited, co-written & directed by Neil Kinsella this is yet another brainless straight-to-video/DVD low budget piece of crap horror film with lots of unintentional comedic moments.
The story is OK with an aging Coop showing he's not yet over-the-hill and a young Richard Webb, later TV's Captain Midnight.
The film ends on a funny note too because despite being a good guy and going back to the army a hero, the film ends with Lucky back in the cooler for yet another act of insubordination making it clear that even his goodness/patriotism has its limits.
Since I'm not from the USA I didn't notice some historical mistakes -mainly the use of guns and rifles not yet invented by the time of the action- I learned about after reading some reviews here; I think those are major flaws in a movie.
Well this show has yet to be released on DVD but since that Deal between Nickoldeon and Amazon.com to release old Nickshows i think this show has a chance of becoming released on DVD.
The show definitely has what it takes to be a hit: big adventures, girl who can talk with animals, plenty of different characters, yet it keeps throwing sticks in it's spokes.
I cry very easily during movies, yet this movie, which was supposed to be a tearjerker did not bring a single tear.
In today's world, the pursuit of happiness for many is the chase for wealth, yet many rich people also find happiness alluding.
I have not read the book, yet I am sure that this is one of the better adaptions of a book to movie.
But I don't want to add much more; I'd spoil the whole thing for all those of you who haven't seen this movie yet .
Now THE ULTIMATE GIFT comes to the screen/DVD and before making the groaning judgment that here is yet another insipid little tale about learning life's lessons and gaining some spirituality in the process, try watching this two hour traversal of well acted and well scripted (Cheryl McKay) and well directed (Michael O. Sajbel) input.
The acting of Abigail Breslin is yet again incredible, I think even better then Little Miss Sunshine, she completely steals the show.
It was clean enough that you could take the whole family to see it, yet interesting enough that the parents will not only stay awake, but you'll actually find yourself caught up in a sweet, and sometimes tear-jerking story about redemption, and the pursuit of true joy.
And yet, "White Rabbit" proves its value by laying the groundwork for a lot of the themes that will be dominant in the future: Jack's leader role; the Jack-Locke "man of science, man of faith" dynamic (the dialogue in this scene is particularly well-written); father-son relationship problems; ghostly manifestations on the island (already introduced in "Walkabout", but now made more clear), specifically connected to the characters; flashbacks that go back to the character's childhood; the realization that the survivors will probably have to stay there for a long time; etc.
If another Fox film had been done I'm sure they'll have not done the deed yet again.
It was touching yet erotic at the same time.
But then it becomes clear that it's yet another fantasy, i.e.
Taxidermia is the goriest, most disturbing and most disgusting film I have ever seen, yet is one of the greatest feats in 21st century movie-making.
And yet they are generally thoughtful, generous, and very wise.
When I saw the "Rize" trailers at first I was afraid that this would be yet another movie depicting the African-American experience through slanted and distorted filters ignorance and the media would have "White America" and the rest of the world believe.
OK first things first,this game is not the greatest game ever released.It will never win awards for graphics storyline or gameplay.It's really just another devil may cry clone yet even with all these stacked against the game it's still brilliant.
Harold Lloyd plays - as the title suggests - a shy tailor who is deathly afraid of girls (to the point at which he stutters every time he talks to one - interestingly done in a "silent" movie) and yet writes a book to teach young men how to understand and win girls.
Never would I have anticipated a film of such staggering comedic brilliance, a romantic tale with enough emotional pangs to please Chaplin, and yet an astonishing climactic action sequence that would make Keaton proud.
'Girl Shy' tells the story of Harold Meadows, a bespectacled young apprentice at a tailor shop who stutters uncontrollably at the sight of a beautiful woman, and yet, ironically, fancies himself experienced enough to write a best-selling instructional manual on how to "make love" with the opposite sex.
Richard Harrison returns once again (albeit unwittingly if you know the history behind these films) as a ninja master yet again named Gordon (but ostensibly not the same character in each film)  At the inception of the movie we see Gordon training a young student named Billy in the ancient warrior art and explaining to him it's historical origins.
Another thing is that the main character Billy has spent all this time being a Ninja yet he doesn't even dress up or use any Ninja skills, he just beats them up or uses Machine guns.
And yet, I always laugh during the "bed scene" in this movie, so maybe they don't really lose me; I hate to say it, but stereotyping IS often funny.
While I disagree with the conventional wisdom about the Marx Brothers' film made before The Big Store, Go West (1940), believing it to be yet another one of their many masterpieces, I have to agree with the conventional wisdom about The Big Store.
The last scene, rather fittingly is of Maggie pulling an envelope from Philips coat pocket (thinking it is yet another school letter she is never destined to read) and opening it to find it is in fact a Mothers Day card.
I've read that another of his films, Tucked In His Knuckles, has that affect on people even more -that it bugs them a good, long while afterward, but I haven't seen it yet.
But I have a strong feeling that's a good sign, that this film is not done with me yet.
The plot is intricate yet realistic, the characters fascinating, the music beautiful, and the quality excellent.
Of course, this brief moment of innovation is quickly superseded by yet another sloppy, clichÃ©- inundated patch of screen writing, but for a matter of minutes, the film hints at the exponentially superior film which might have resulted from its chaotic, sickening mess.
However, a less common genre trait is to have the female characters painted in just as superficial, reductionist terms as the men in the story, yet Bride Wars proves just as determined to reduce both sexes to insulting stereotypes, including, to a worrisomely large degree, its protagonists.
The two leading women Zhao and Qi are both drop dead gorgeous and yet they are not exploited in the film in any sexual manner.
And yet it sounded like it could be a lot of fun, at least judging by the premise, which reverses the classic wedding stereotype: women are in it for the romance, guys are game because it's fun (that's what they make it look like in American comedies, anyway).
This movie has wonderful pacing and several cliffhanger moments, as Harvey's plot several times seems on the point of failure or exposure, but he manages to beat the odds yet again.
Sometimes it's good for the soul to watch mindless, yet enormously entertaining, popcorn movies.
When on the pitch, our first film was filmed at a relatively human speed, yet here we have fast action shots which look absolutely insane.
If you haven't seen Goal yet, you should catch that before seeing part 2.
While perhaps not the worst movie ever made - so long as Battlefield Earth is still in circulation - this movie is DEFINITELY the worst digital-video-transferred-to-film flick yet to come down the pipe (notice the sewer analogy there).
Instead of a simple yet crackerjack story about four people who act as go-betweens in the purchase of a strange creature locked in a box, we are treated to gobbledygook that involves copious and ludicrous gunplay, a battle to the death with ninja transvestites, and a creature that looks like a modified Doc Johnson sex toy that psychoanalyses its victims to death.
The fact that they were no more than B-cups yet remain the most memorable aspect of this movie should say it all.
We follow a morbid, yet naive heiress, who invites a man named Count Alucard (Dracula spelt backwards) to her U.S. home.
It draws you in from the first 5 mins and then keeps you going and yet it is such a simple storyline.
Am I there yet?
Not yet.
The premise sounds like one of those film that are really stupid yet still kind of funny.
There were a few funny lines yet nothing that really made me laugh a lot.
Crossing Jordan is yet another dark tale and generally as concerned with Jordan's sex life as with crime investigation.
And yet, despite the miscasting of the male vampire, "Son of Drac" still turns out to be a very good old-school horror.
The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future.
It gets you thinking, as most movies today fail to do, and yet becomes a modern day classic with its ideas
Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn't done it yet?
But this approach, with marvelous special effects and beautiful action, seems to overkill the point it wants to make : The future is inescapable and predictable, and yet the future can be tampered with and manipulated.
This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.
In one of his best pictures yet.
Never fail to believe: Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece.
Now that he is on the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer, Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he hasn't even met yet.
He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen.
It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the last of which was the spectacular A.I.).
This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive.
Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair?
Sharply directed by Roy Rowland and brilliantly photographed by John Alton, it is criminal that this terrific film has yet to see a DVD release.
I agree with the director that languor and easy films are needed in our fast pace world, yet, here the length is doing your film a disservice.
It's also quite easy to find several gaping logic and plot holes in here that differ from the norm of vampires, yet these spoil the plot and can't be revealed.
It was obvious Crawford was dangerous and unbalanced--yet he foolishly taunted her.
'Possessed' is yet another great entry in this genre that has captured my attention during this period of time.
CAST/PERFORMANCES: Joan Crawford (Louise Howell Graham) Â Crawford's transformation from personally neurotic, yet mild, unobtrusive caregiver to scheming, paranoid, jealous, unstable woman scorned is fairly believable, given the plot.
Brooks has been going steady with Heflin and Crawford, not over him yet, is seething.
Matt Dillon is especially good and displays a depth to his acting that had yet to be seen when this was first released.
This hunk of crap only runs 84 minutes, yet I feel I have lost months of my life!
When Mercouer died in 1835 at the age of 26, her mother had her poems imprinted on her gravestone, yet now the letters have faded and with it Elisa's claim on immortality.
Directed by Rene Clair who also made "Le Million", which I reviewed, and "A Nous La Liberte," (some say that is his masterpiece, but I have yet to see, but will) this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest, and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!
I haven't read other people's comments yet which will leave this opinion unbiased.
I don't understand why the mother does not cancel going to Hong Kong and choose yet another life, to live with her family with less income, after reconciliation with her daughter.
i still have yet to see a movie that doesn't capitalize so much on the manipulation of emotions for the purpose of amassing revenues.
The love of Katie ( Michelle Pfeiffer who gives yet another moving performance) and Ben ( Bruce Willis who shows great talent in an unusual role.
The younger couples, the ones that are engaged, just don't get it yet.
The Story of Us, is a complex, yet ultimately simple, explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them, but that if you're both willing to work on, make the relationship all that much richer for it.
In under one hour, this film tells a complex story, yet is exciting and plays like a good mystery, though in a western setting.
To be honest, his character as the villain is by far the one thing which brings parts of the story downhill, yet gives some humor for B-movie appeal.
Kudos to the director for keeping me from walking out, but I've yet to see anyone tackle a subject matter like this and blow me away.
Myers plays his most forgettable character yet as Guru Pitka aka Maurice, who plays every single joke in the Mike Myers' book.
The funniest parts are gleefully juvenile, but they are, unfortunately, outnumbered by gags that are simply juvenile or, worse yet, juvenile and mean-spirited.
Instead of playing Curley's wife as the pathetic yet lonely and almost unconsciously sexy woman that Sherilynn Fenn made her in the 1992 film, Betty Field makes her obnoxiously slutty, whiny, loud and shrill, and we are annoyed and repelled at her instead of being made to empathize with her plight.
Not overwhelmingly bad yet nothing all too great about this one either.
This story of the smart little guy and the very dumb big guy, set against the backdrop of the California of the Depression period, has all the makings of a classic, yet somehow it falls a little short.
I wish that John Ford could have had a crack at this, yet director Lewis Milestone does an excellent job with the material; he is at all times sensitive and observant, letting each actor strut his stuff.
His feeling for nature, so central to the book, is not so great, yet this could have been imposed on him by budgetary restraints.
This fine stage actress had yet to learn to act for the camera.
The ending is surprising, sad, and lonely, yet somehow gratifying and assuring.
This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet
One scene featured some notorious television executives storming into the set demanding safe yet unoriginal concepts.
It could have been totally amazing, yet seemed repetitive.
If on the other hand you want silly, surreal yet still very funny British comedy then go for Garth Marenghi, The Mighty Boosh, The IT crowd or Even dare i say, Red Dwarf.
I have read a few of the commentaries on both this "original" filming and the latterday Sinise/Malkovich version, which I have yet to see, and find little to disagree with in my samplings.
Sebastian Love & The Prime Minister - Sebastian (the PM's Assistant) has a crush on the Prime Minister and Expresses it, yet the PM doesn't get the picture.
And the fact that she doesn't even recognize the guy whom she thinks has killed a beloved pooch and yet trusts and sends him to look after her fish, so that he can conveniently discover their childhood connection that lasted, what, maybe a week, which is more than enough time for an enraged father to locate his errant son in a small Chinese village?
The movie is full of laugh out loud jokes, and is, in my opinion, Adam Sandler's best work yet.
Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male-prostitute car-scene, the gut-burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks.
Sandler has not made a movie yet that I could sit through saying "That was brilliant!"
It's amazing to see how insane yet practical Rydell's (Nicholson) methods are.
In fact, he has never in his life fired a gun in anger, yet has somehow fostered total law, order and respect among the townsfolk.
I liked it, and recommend it to any Jim Carrey fan, or someone who just wants some, comedy that's stupid, yet funny.
I've yet to see Bob Steele in any of his Westerns where he comes across as such a dominant character, even when he's portraying a villain as he does here.
And yet millions of people including myself and Jim Carrey still can't stop laughing.
This is not a perfect film, yet the power of the story it tells is so compelling that I cannot in good conscience give this film anything but a 10.
Such dedication to detail may add to the realism, yet it can also depress an audience looking for what movies do bestÂprovide escape.
If you haven't done so yet, Shame On You!
It's powerful because it's realistic; no stereotyped good guys or bad guys here (it's based on a true story, after all), and yet plenty of cruelty and some kindness, which leads to an exploration of themes such as justice and mercy in a way that (at last) doesn't lead to boredom or cynicism.
The film is nowhere to be found in Roger Ebert's reviews or Leonard Maltin's annual guide, and yet I suspect that Ebert, at least, would rate this film very highly.
Unfortunately, they do not know that Jafar and Iago are not finished yet.
There's another movie called Rasen which I haven't seen yet, so I can't tell you about it.
The whole film showcases possibly the least realistic animation I've yet to see in a Disney film.
Or better yet, just watch a Tarantino film instead.
And yet, even with faults in the writing, Schatzberg got one thing incredibly right: casting Freeman as Fast Black.
Its amazing to me too how many commented how closely it followed the Gospel of Matthew,,,,,yet it left out quite a bit and actually mixed up, for one reason or another the sequence of events.
This is a claustrophobic little film, independently made with a small budget, yet it delivers the goods.
The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to Seiichi Tanabe who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero TÃ´yama.
Mitchum is a rather amiable, self-confident, yet low-key lead who's easy to watch, although his fight scenes are indeed hard to swallow.
This is a sloppy mess of a comedy, with barely a plot to speak of, yet it contains some of the funniest bits Mr. Lewis has ever committed to film.
is told in such a unique and refreshing way which adds new life to the Biblical story yet sticks with it well enough to convey the same sense of power and inspiration.
Just a woman who loved a man enough to marry him, yet in both films she becomes a victim.
It wasn't her fault that Irene Dunne (Ellen) wasn't dead yet she is treated so rudely and offhandedly that I found it irritating and frustrating.
The cast is marvelous, topped by yet another Oscar-worthy performance by Irene Dunne, who offers a multi-dimensional portrayal in a genre where one-note characterizations typically run rampant.
In jail (which is constructed of an old elevator gate, and could be pushed over without effort) they all are released under the promise they find the killer of "Nitro Jones" (horribly played by Juvenille).Not surprisingly, he is in the movie for less than five minutes, yet gets the lead credit.
The film is drawing-room bitchery, yet with only minimal camp appeal; still, it's hardly enjoyable even on that level since nobody here appears to be having any fun.
The ending is predictable and "tragic" and yet "happy" at the same time, which is to say, melodramatic and chuckle-inducing.
They are haunted by memories and demons just like we are, yet they keep on because they know more than anything that the minute details of their day to day doings affect millions.
The title of the film suggest the theme of the story so similar but yet so different.
Rent the original instead, or better yet just watch the vastly superior Die Hard for the upturn time.
Ford is also at the top of his game in the action sequences of the film as well proving yet again that Ford is both a fine actor and a fine action hero as well.
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is the third adaptation of yet another Tom Clancy bestseller, spawned by the success of the previous Clancy adaptations THE HUNT FOR RED October and PATRIOT GAMES.
This film is entertaining from start to finish with a surprisingly clever plot considering the genre and credit must go to Ford for starring and excelling in yet another blockbuster.
The character's are dull & clichÃ©d, a journalist, a bratty teenage kid, a TV news reporter, the guy who knows everything & tries to warn everyone but no one will believe him, the police captain with a bad attitude, the local mayor who doesn't care about an impending disaster but only about his towns celebrations & a dull villain who gets to walk around in a black suit & look menacing yet without actually doing much.
Shame on you!If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you're thinking it would be a good film to watch, I might have lost some respect for you.Overall, this was a terrible movie.The acting was horrendous, the special effects were complete crap, and the whole story line is absolutely ridiculous and quite laughable even.The "SCARY" parts are as bout as scary a cute little puppy dog, and the characters are as bout as believable as a magical wonderland full of fairies, goblins, and dragons.The only thing good about it, was that it was ACTUALLY entertaining, and it kept my interest, but don't think that means I'm telling you to watch it.By all means, avoid this film for as long as you can, and I'm sure you won't suffer TOO much of a loss.
It was clichÃ©d and methodical, yet still managed to be quite unfathomnnable.
So they go to HK trying to escape these ghosts but yet there still hunted, so they have to finish the last one in order to not see ghosts.
you see it's very disjointed but yet i still enjoyed the movies and some of it's ideas it had.
The Pang Brothers should have developed a decent script before churning out yet another disappointing sequel.
I think this movie is like pointing a gun at a child's face watching them scream moving the gun away from them then pointing the gun over and over again at their face disturbingly funny yet immorally wrong, why don't these actors think am i actually in a movie like this or why Michael Dudikoff is in any film for that matter.
It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clichÃ© problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy.
10 out of 10 for the movie, ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.
It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD yet.
As children, we might remember seeing things and make a simple yet direct remark about it, yet, as adults, we might see things, stop to think about it, taking into account all our past experiences and teachings, and make an "observation", when we soon realize that there are other people that have their own "observations".
Worse yet is how the young person does not immediately see this transformation.
He can have his "moment" with Melissa, yet he will risk humiliation, knowing that Rick had set this up.
I have not seen the third yet but I will soon!!
Pleasure Party is yet another offering from the great Claude Chabrol that puts it's central focus on the director's all time favourite subject; that being infidelity.
I haven't yet been able to see Rasen--the actual sequel to Ring-- and I'm concerned that it seems to consist of only one movie.
The concept of multi-ordinality replaces unambiguous mappings through ambiguous ones - yet, not in a chaotic, but exactly restricted sense.
You won't really get where he's going with the story until you read "Loop" (2005), whose movie hasn't been made yet.
Sadako's curse is not finished yet.
Ah, yet another short instructional film that doesn't stand up to the test of time.
There is a little kid who gets a coin every time he drinks milk, which he saves in a piggybank; yet when it gets full does not have the heart to break it.
And, yet, ultimately the film draws to a wonderful and fitting conclusion.
In a case of Joan's art imitating her life, as well as her life imitating her art, Harriet provides Joan with yet *one* more of those peculiar roles Â roles which must have been written with *only* Joan in mind, since it would be difficult to imagine *any* other actress in this role.
There is a touch of Pirandello-ish identification here, and it comes through loud and clear; and yet for all this, Miss Crawford is never hammy.
What I saw was a story so pointless, acting so intense yet superficial, disjointed continuity, extremely poor, choppy editing, over-crowded effects, pointless and gratuitous violence.
When I saw this movie for the first time I wasn't Meg Ryan's fan yet.
If you didn't see it yet, you really should!
In the 1980's, Dante made some wildly enjoyable movies including Gremlins and its sequel, Explorers, The 'burbs and The Howling; usually state-of-the-art yet delightfully old-fashioned and nostalgic charming, thrilling, marvellously referential to older movies (I'd say Dante did this better than nearly any other director), and with very imaginative story-lines filled with quirky characters, surreal humour and generous lashings of excitement.
By the end, you'll be left breathless, and yet it still manages to conclude on a delightful open note.
NB What looked like an opening for a definite sequel never did eventuate, or at least no yet!
And yet, what a fun and enjoyable film it is.
Can anybody tell me why almost everybody loves "Back to the Future" yet nobody ever deigns to mention this little beauty in the same breath?
Quaid is excellent as the cocky yet likeable "Tuck Pendleton".
From beginning to end, "The Doe Boy" exudes a powerful, yet non-sensationalistic and understated spirituality that many films would do well to emulate.
"Brothers in Arms" is the latest in the sub-genre of 'hip-hop westerns', which stills strikes me as a great idea, but has yet to be realized into something more worthy than direct to video fare (Wild Wild West included).
I mean, some guys come up with the brilliant plan of walking straight into a bank loaded with treasure yet with no guards whatsoever, flash a gun, take the money before some guy chasing them magically appears outside from nowhere and we have a final shootout.
Hulk saves the world, yet again.
He has the voice, looks and talent yet was denied the starring role in the film to an actor with no vocal talent whats so ever.
We had a gasoline shortage in 2000 and in August of 2006 and now we have yet another gasoline problem.
I agree with one of the earlier posts that ppl must be getting offended 'cause he's officially made fun of everyone and if he hadn't yet, then this routine touched that last nerve on the so-called "hard-core" supporters that think that his best yrs are behind him.
The majority of the material seems to be centered around subjects like death, dying, suicide, murder, and other cheery topics, yet, as always when watching George, I found myself laughing my ass off and agreeing with everything he says because after all these years of pushing the comedic envelope, one constant that has never changed with George is that everything he says is absolutely correct.
This is a towering achievement on a grand scale, yet with much to say to individuals with conscience.
And yet for me, the most powerful, tour de force performance was Beah Richards as... Beah Richards.
And yet for me, the most powerful, tour de force performance was Beah Richards as... Beah Richards.
The photography and sound bring a hyper-reality to this tale of merchant sailors, fearful for their lives, argumentative yet loving, full of weakness but capable of strength and honor.
Haven't watched any of the extras yet, though from what I've read here this is the "downbeat" Cantonese cut of the film.
It's not wholly a show about nice detective in Hawaii who punches the bad guys, kisses the fine babies, and plays the saxophone badly in between; actually he is that yet with more.
Not to mention the distinct relationship between (Higgins) and (Magnum), it develops from English gentleman vs. straight American, to severe father and rebel son, to friends, very different friends yet resemble each other and learn from each other, with keeping all the previous symptoms runs on and under the surface.
The permanent tribute that makes Jess to the feminine body, from the respect and the admiration, is one of the characteristics of the cinema of Frank Jess that not yet has been valued sufficiently.
No thrills, no action, cinematography that gets painfully awful at some times and a final shot (involving a swarm of more killer dots) portraying that this silly nightmare isn't over yet.
Nor would I even try.As a few more extras get stung and die-the only way to get out of this bad movie before the drawn out ending-the sheriff tries to warn the townspeople.But don't pluck your tulips just yet,folks.The sheriff saves the day and the plants are pollinated just in time for crop season.As for the herd of dead stung cattle-we assume 'Killer Bees 11' will start with the town having a big old barbecue.
What we have here is yet another undercooked look at criminals in the UK.
It's simple, cheap (and, yet again, filmed in Canada, to save even more money) and silly.
Of course, I recommend this movie to any Wes Anderson fan, but if you're new to this director and you have yet to jump on 'the train,' (No pun intended), this is a fantastic place to start.
Siblings often know each other so well, and yet they never really know each other well enough, as is the truth with these three brothers.
After all their secrets come out, getting thrown off the train, trying to rescue some kids but one unfortunately dies, attending the funeral, and finally seeing runaway delusional mom who apparently has no interest in her sons' lives, abandons them yet again that the brothers leave on another train to, I guess, sort out their lives.
Hell, if "Rushmore" wasn't such a damn masterpiece, I'd say Wes has made his best film yet.
The comedy is derived from sibling tension and the conflicts of the past, and even the music, that typical Anderson blend of quirky yet affecting relatively unknown tracks which is very good and works in all the right ways, feels comfortable and expected despite its "newness".
Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson, it should come as no surprise that his latest film, The Darjeeling Limited, demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction, arguably Anderson's strongest work to date.
The Darjeeling Limited is a metaphor-laden ride in which the characters all have baggage, both literal and figurative, that they cannot seem to shed because they have yet to understand that they would be less encumbered without it.
The brothers are exasperating and shallow, at times even petty, and yet you find yourself liking them all the same.
Jack is highly sexed, yet seems uncomfortable in his body, hiding behind his little porn star moustache.
The film is absolutely engaging from the very start with a hilarious, memorable cameo by Bill Murray, trying to catch the Darjeeling Limited train in slow motion, yet is outrun by Adrien Brody's Peter to the tune of The Kinks' This Time Tomorrow, one of the three Kinks songs in the film (all are accompanied by slow motion sequences).
Performance-wise, the standout is Wilson, in what might be his best role yet.
The emotional, yet blissful experience that is The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's best film thus far, defeating Rushmore for that top spot.
Francoise Rosay as Margaret Molyneux moves through the film with complete assurance in her social status, yet she is so easily flattered into coy behavior.
The resolution, such as it is, is a complete lie, because there is no crime, and yet it is brilliantly subversive because it completely disrupts the duplicitous order at the beginning, it alienates people living convenient compartmentalised lives from themselves, forcing them to confront, if only for a moment, their true desires, which contradict their public faces,  DROLE is ridiculously funny, and Prevert's arch theatricality has never been used to greater effect.
Another plus is one of the most remarkable casts ever assembled - Michel Simon is immensely touching as the bemused gardener forced to abandon the comforts of his mimosa for the chaos of life on the run (private property being the conservative definition of self); Francoise Rosay is incomparable as the grande dame, besotted by social propriety, yet seething with untapped lust; the young Jean-Louis Barrault is a little callow compared to his seasoned elders, but endearingly impudent - the scene in the greenhouse pond with Rosay is a mock-classical treasure.
Best of all is Carne's style, completely unrestrained, unafraid to go for 'gag'-like effects (the mugging of dandies for buttonholes is particularly piquant), beavering through fairy-tale sets that do for London what TOP HAT did for Venice, completely at ease with the farce, yet still pulling off evocative shots that reveal the emotional reality behind the nonsense.
Young Sadako is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
If you haven't figured that out yet, see this film and maybe you'll begin to understand.
This definitely isn't a porn movie yet the sex is almost like the fifth character in the movie.
I read some great reviews at Movies.com on it and it seems like it is held in great respect by critics who know it was unfairly snubbed by the Academy and even Golden Globes because of a young, yet talented cast with a low budget-an independent film!
The country is torn apart by war, Dracuala's minions are everywhere and yet Father Uffizi and his comic relief sidekick Luke are determined to reach the vampire's castle and to destroy him once and for all.
After having watched this movie Dracula III i thought that they should have kept Stephen Billington as the one and only Dracula in the third movie because he gave it that, how do you say?, mystery and yet at the same time he keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart rate fast and makes you anticipate his beautifully exotic voice.
I've got to admit i wasn't sure if i was going to like this film because they had yet again changed the actor for Dracula.
It is all modern and yet it still feels like a 19th/20th century run country (in parts of it anyway).
One of the finest Dracula acting jobs I've seen yet.
It is riotously funny yet as painful as Chaplin's dinner in "The Gold Rush" in which, as the evening wears on, it becomes clear that his lovely female guests won't show up.
To be so disfigured and yet so kind.
And yet he never defended himself.
I've always been told that I'm fairly mature for my age - I'm not even old enough to drive yet & I'm already learning & respecting morals.
The ending is sad yet sobering.
Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him.
David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all.
The black man, the Native American woman, the Mexicans, the Anglos, and then the rancher's not so faithful mistress, give this movie a lot of great subplots to think about, but the central story of Valdez first asking and then demanding money for the dead man's woman is simple yet effective as it draws out into chases and ambushes while revealing the characters for who they really are.
So, if you haven't seen it yet, I give this one my highest recommendation.
The reason you watch yet again, still eager, is simple.
Elaine May's direction was delicate yet purposeful, allowing for the superb development of characters ( in particular Eddie Albert's curmudgeonly businessman/father) without impeding the flow of the plot.
He's obnoxious in his determination to get what he thinks he wants and yet somehow comes across as sincere and likable.
Outrageous, ridiculous, annoying, seemingly made on-the-cheap, and yet one of the most endearing comedies of the 60s/70s.
And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go.
There are a number of shots on location on the California coast that made me ache with homesickness and yet, in others, you feel like you're standing in this familiar town, walking down familiar streets.
The story itself is wonderful, simple yet not to the point of boredom as it has several twists and turns that even my best friend who has a knack for ruining all plots reversals for me couldn't guess.
It takes the viewer on a gentle yet sometimes heart-wrenching ride through the daily lives of Tish, Piper, Jen and Priestly, under the watchful eye of the sandwich shop owner, Trucker.
Charming in it's simplicity yet creatively presented, with locations that feel familiar enough to allow me to put myself into each scene.
For a movie who's tenuous message seemed to be "looks don't matter" (yet everyone is plastic-ally pretty) The only interesting character was forced to conform to the shallow beauty ethic by removing his individuality in order to get the loose girl.
The dramatic aspects of the film were familiar and yet not predictable.
Clea DuVall is, as usual, a quiet but very intense presence on the screen, yet the filmmakers don't let her steal the show entirely.
Priestly is a nice change of pace because he is allowed to embrace his comedic talent while portraying his most normal and well-adjusted character yet, despite the character's outward appearance.
Having been in the industry for nearly 2 decades when this movie was released, it's exciting to see the (still gorgeous) actress making yet another Leaving Las Vegas-style breakthrough.
I don't want to give away any important plot points, so suffice it to say that this movie left me with the same disturbed, depressed, yet greatly moved feeling that I get from movies like American Beauty.
However, I would much rather see a first time director tackle a project with the complexity and ambition of "Leo" than to have them make yet another pseudo wry, post modern, Tarantino imitation, or, worse, a boring, routine slasher film.
Once back on board they play out the charade that their romance can continue, each hiding from the other their own known fate yet secretly knowing their own and each others.
At once almost unbearably sad yet uplifting.
Kay Francis glows in every scene, yet her acting shines with her delivery.
They are both very attractive, yet doomed.
This gives the film a dual feeling of being very primal and yet otherworldly.
Instead of lamenting Fellini's seemingly poor control of the narrative, audiences should be applauding his triumph in bringing the full experience of this chaotic yet important film to the screen.
This film is has bizarre dialog, repulsive images, many freaks of nature, strange music, scenes that don't make sense, and yet at the same time, repeated viewings will show that it does make sense... simply because the moral of this story is that it doesn't make sense, and life can go in a thousand crazy directions, we're all like dice in the hands of fate.
If one rates a film on visuals alone, Fellini's SATYRICON would surely be completely off the scale: a phantasmagorical mixture of sensual beauty and the distasteful but evocative grotesque set in an ancient Rome that never was, never could have been, and yet which plays up to every extreme concept we secretly harbor about Roman decadence.
And yet, oddly, the film is sterile.
It has Fincher's trademark intellect (if he hasn't trademarked it yet, he should).
The film is clearly a journey of life's common ups and downs that are common for all yet this man's story of age and living is most uncommon.
That's what this epic masterpiece of a film shows it's clearly an emotional, and touching picture to love for the way it shows how life can be in a different order yet still it shows that it can be memorable.
As advertised the plot of the picture is both simple yet intriguing.
In this light The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fascinating yet ultimately very hollow film.
The characters change drastically physically, yet they do not go through a single change mentally.
"Benjamin" was an odd person to me; you could root for him, yet not admire him.
He, of course, is instantly lovable, yet almost unknowable.
If you love action and don't want martial arts in it, try this film because it is the most stylish, gun crazy film around and I haven't seen a film which comes close to it yet.
Sinatra's role is beautifully engineered, yet with sobriety and taste, and he naturally dominates the stage, eclipses all others, crushes mercilessly any other screen presence.
Stark portrays the world as we know it perfectly, while in Arcadia is a mystical right out of fairy-tales - so amazing yet believable.
I'm running out of adjectives so here's the bottom line -  If you have given up on adventure games you obviously haven't played The Longest Journey yet.
Neither the prospect of eighty minutes of biting headwind nor snow showers has been able to keep me from the National Film Theatre over the three weeks so far of its Buster Keaton season, and every time the films have yet to disappoint: "Battling Butler" is no exception!
See it if you can; regardless of its' flaws, it's still an amazing document of yet another turbulent period in the amazing lifespan of this remarkably resilient band.
And yet, there is also another argument, and this even more-so could be said for today, that C***sucker Blues, in revealing what's shocking mixed with the banal dealings of hotel rooms and the fly-on-the-wall style on back-stage, is important in retrospect.
I have about 6 bootlegs from this era of the Stones, and he amazes every time, musically the Stones at their best, yet watching him on stage, I can see why he left.
The plot is lame, the acting is horrible, and only Goldie Hawn gives a good performance(I have yet to see a movie in which Goldie wasn't good).
Similarly, Harvey Keitel delivers powerfully in his first collaboration with Scorsese, but the plot and dramatic impact of the script were just not quite up to snuff yet.
The dialogue in the scene is also wonderful, and not at all plot-oriented - arguably because there was no semblance of a plot yet but also because both Keitel and Bethune speak and act naturally, as two people who are simply interested in what the other has to say.
He tries to find the words to explain but can't, and mumbles about being old-fashioned, and not ready yet.
Scorsese would move on to make Mean Streets, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, GoodFellas, and several other movies that double, triple and demolish the impact this first work, completed with greatly impatient urgency when he was 25, but as with most independent debuts, nearly all of which overstep the bounds of self-indulgence anyway, which has yet to prove a problem for Scorsese, one must be objective with its flaws and not water down its lack of guile.
they make this film seem as in its just an art-house good college try for martin scorsese, who'd become one of the best directors (who has never yet gotten an oscar) of our time - but i think this film is fantastic on its own.
This movie made too many regards which are truly full of love and longing to a lot of things : the adolescence's folly, the friendship's coolest memories, the pure fondness of a movie star, the fiery sexy yet innocent days of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the good old Hollywood, and lastly the utmost sex icon ..The shiniest star yet.. (Marilyn Monroe).
In brief it was as madly sexy as any of Marilyn's kisses yet more emotional and a bit lamentably moving.
An excellent adaptation (by the author) of a story by Mordecai Richter and yet another feather in the NFBC's cap.
He had done that type of film before, with independent man John Singleton, among others in that film I regret not seeing yet, "Boyz N' the Hood".
Truly original with a tough yet poetic style, it is beautifully photographed, erotically charged and masterfully directed by the great Raoul Walsh.
The plot unfurls - and boy, does it take its time - in that familiar device that enjoyed something of a vogue at the time, the flashback, so we begin with Teresa Wright - Mitchum's wife and longtime 'sister', given she's the biological daughter of Anderson and has grown up with Mitchum - riding out to join Mitchum, who is holed up and being pursued by a gang of what we don't yet know.
Jack Warner tested and rejected first Montgomery Clift yet to make his screen debut and Kirk Douglas according to Lee Server's biography.
The screenplay is by Niven Busch, who also wrote DUEL IN THE SUN, and what saves PURSUED from descending into camp is not a better story but restrained acting, crisp straightforward direction, gloriously dark cinematography and an ominous yet contained mood that feels like an approaching thunderstorm.
Freud was trendy in the 1940s, and Hollywood turned out a number of overwrought yet simple-minded movies about characters whose twisted psyches can be explained by a single event in their childhoods (SPELLBOUND, THE LOCKET, etc.)
A man doomed, alienated, yet strangely comfortable in that condition, relaxing into his peculiar blend of lucklessness and invincible self-assurance.
This is where we yet again see 'Duane Dibbley' and Lister marries a gelf in exchange for a vital engine part, screaming as he runs away: 'Change of plan...LEG IT!'
He managed to convey a man so blinded by himself, believing himself worthless, yet somehow destined for ultimate greatness at the same time, with a naivety that surpassed even The Cat's.
In the third series, the crew are joined by an android, Kryten, who has a manic obsession with cleaning and helping, which leads to yet more hilarious consequences.
He has no redeeming qualities what so ever, and yet it's impossible not to love him.
Frank Sinatra was excellent in his role as John Baron, a ruthless and psychotic yet street smart hired assassin.
Its got so much gore and alien homeworlds and broadswords, and yet im sure if you took your wife/girlfriend or religious father to see it they would nod and smile at the end and say 'i didn't think id enjoy that''but it was quite good actually'  I haven't felt so excited watching a film in years!
Woohoo there is hope for him yet.
I never would have believed it, that you could combine Spaceships and futuristic races with Norse Mythology...yet, here it is in one GREAT movie!
The story is simple and yet gripping.
However, if you are NOT familiar with the play or history (which, by the way, is a lot different than the way Shakespeare portrayed it), then watch this AFTER you read the Cliff Notes--or better yet, see the TV series BLACK ADDER I!
Z3 has yet another unimaginative plot, with insignificant details and more flashy outfits and scenes than characters.
In addition, the villain of this movie is not nearly as sinister as Wyndom, having no clear motive or even an immediate effect on Zenon herself-- yet Zenon willingly takes on trying to foil his scheme.
What strikes me as shocking about 'Porky's Railroad' is its absolutely -- even brutally, I should say -- honest depiction of the soul of man under capitalism -- to paraphrase the title of that famous book by Oscar Wilde -- which I unfortunately have not read yet.
Okay, fine, I'm lazy as hell at home and I ask my parents for money and I don't have a job yet.
If you haven't watched it yet, save yourself some time.
I think this show needs to be renamed to "Spoiled, Rotten, B****es" I have yet to see an episode without a rotten teen featured in it, and believe me, it's not a show I will ever try and catch a new episode.
Did i mention how Fake and cheesy she seemed.Its like they like being on TV so they have to be swearing all the time at their parents and burning then down to ashes with these creepy yet hilarious stares.
How could any 16 year old be such a low life bag of slime and better yet how could the parents be so mind numbingly easy going toward them!
I would be fine seeing these Paris Hilton clones get bad reputations and better yet, publicity in their High Schools.
The parents allow unbelievable rudeness by their spawns of the devil, yet lavish these monsters with clothes, cars, etc.
Interestingly, he even saw fit to steal from himself Â since JONATHAN OF THE BEARS (1993) bears {sic} more than a cursory nod to the latter; another thing he was prone to doing was reviving popular mythical figures, such as the disastrous SINBAD OF THE SEVEN SEAS (1989) and the TV mini-series THE RETURN OF SANDOKAN (1996; which I recently acquired but have yet to check out) Â though, in all fairness, he did muster a fairly successful re-imagining of Homer's "The Illiad" in gangland terms with the little-known spoof HECTOR THE MIGHTY (1971).
And yet, it continues to mimic Jaws (1975) down to the bone.
It's supposed to be 35 feet long, yet we never get the idea that it's that large.
Not a single taboo is left untouched in Nikos Nikolaidis convoluted screenplay, whether it involves tasteless sexual perversions or insanely violent tendencies, and yet Â in some inexplicable fashion Â it's all beautifully illustrated in the eye of the camera.
Filmed in beautiful black-and-white, it's a one-of-a-kind film, more purely noir than most noir retreads of recent years, yet far too demented to be considered merely noir.
However they stumble upon a crazy cult of yet more evil people who want to "reduce them to sexual beasts" before killing them.
These three hours feature subtle romance, elegant action sequences that showcase the Chinese approach to psychological and strategic warfare, while yet serving as a poignant statement about the horror of war and the possibility of redemption.
Has some flaws, such as slow-paced action, and the 'video-look', but still, for a movie with practically no budget, it's very strange off-the-wall, yet enjoyable.
Fantastic graphics and are put to scale; not like other try-hard games like Tiberian Sun (which I might add was released one year after yet it was worse!)
Steel Trap is yet another really poor attempt at making a buck of other peoples original ideas.
And yet I cannot look away!
There's even a couple of scenes I could have dealt without, but still they're in there, and quite frankly the makers of this film did a great job with what they had to work with and created a nostalgic, yet entertaining flick that is fun to watch from beginning to end.
Corny, fun, interesting and light-hearted are the perfect ways to sum up this movie, and if you haven't seen it, of course don't expect a masterpiece, but you will enjoy it for it's wacky characteristics and overall cheesiness, yet emotional effectiveness.
The tone may often seem a bit maudlin, particularly the scene requesting audience participation near the end, yet this film was released in mid 1947 and life for the intended audience was as bad as or worse than our fictional couple.
The high-tech yet raw atmosphere, the lighting, even the camera-work reminded me of it.
Elevator lady especially with her uniform thats sexy yet professional looking.
I can't see both views being given equal weight in biology classes because, if Darwinian evolution is "only a theory," as the ID people argue, then Intelligent Design hasn't yet cleared even that bar.
Personally, I think it is best performance yet.
He blunders his way into his unlikely role as a keeper of hope, and once there, cannot see from moment to moment how he can maintain it, wishes at times he could be rid of the burden, and yet somehow, manages to continue to inspire others who are so desperate for hope, they don't even try to disbelieve.
Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased.
It runs as smooth as silk yet creates just enough tension to keep you on your seat.
Yet, inevitably, because of this rarity, we can't but be intrigued as we watch these people behave as all Americans do, yet with a grace and refinement so unique to Asian culture.
Overall, I felt there are similarities in filmmaking style between Lynne Ramsay's "Morvern Callar" and Eric Byler's "Charlotte Sometimes" - the value of quiet moments, sparse dialog scenes, minimal lighting and silhouette shots; depiction of lonely feelings, alone-ness all by her/himself; loving yet not openly/readily showing soÂsecrets, pains, longings kept within.
The storytelling approach is resonant of each other: not revealing it all to the audience, yet using music - here Byler has included songs by Cody ChestnuTT, to set the pace and tempo of the film.
I am not Asian, yet I totally identify with the mail lead.
I have never seen such an explicit film that was so raw, yet romantic and pure.
Her part is underwritten and yet another clichÃ©, but she is so crazy that it doesn't matter.
It's nice to see some quite realistic yet action-packed shootout.
Some quite good acting and a complex yet sense-making plot (if you can't understand it, watch it again or wait until you've finished high-school..).
And I think it's a gem of a programme which has never failed to raise a laugh yet.
UN CHANT d'AMOUR is a remarkable short: sordid, brutal, provocative; yet as poetic and lyrical as its title suggests.
But you're not ready for a timeless classic yet.
This is comedy gold and if you haven't seen it yet go and find it, buy it, watch it, and learn how the master won over the hearts of millions with his rude, sometimes crude, always intelligent and masterful art.
The theater was filled with a rowdy crowd and I remember her looking very uncomfortable, yet as his routine unfolded and everyone else started laughing, I kept catching my Mother smiling or trying not to laugh.
We are caught up in his moral dilemma, of not wanting to lose the wonderful gift he has found and yet not wanting to be untrue to himself.
Hats of for SLB for making a different kind of movie, its very different from the other movies he made, and yet not as good as the others, but Sawwaria is still a good movie to watch.
One, which they consummate and live with; and the other, which they adore, yet foolishly ignore!
This ignored, yet adored beloved of a sensitive and sensible woman is Â.
We have yet another jaw-dropping performance by Rani Mukherjee Â her choreography in the song 'Chabeela' is amazing.
The second purpose has not been discovered yet."
Great plot, nothing unique yet was done with such style and pizazz that you thought you were getting something original.
There was a good blend of language in it too, which kept it kind of interesting, and yet could throw some people off of what is going on.
If you're a fan of Âheroic bloodshed' action and for whatever reason haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favour.
We delve into the complicated and frightening (yet very tragic) character that is Sadako Yamamura.
It takes a while to get going, and even once it does nothing cool ever happens until the finale, which involves yet another spider, this one bigger than a large sports car, getting loose in Los Angles.
The CGI was decent at times, yet laughable in some parts (especially when the spider was running around walls etc).
I pray that somehow this moving, gentle, inspiring work of art will be re-issued, so that it can be enjoyed again by the many who love it and enrich the lives of those who have yet to see it.
Clearly a waste of time for the underwritten Perkins and sad to see such a talented and perennially underused actor ill and jaded in a career on the wane, although far worse was yet to come (ie 'In The Deep Woods').
Dame Wendy Hiller was perfect in her quiet, dignified, yet resolute portrayal of Lady Sloan.
Not a wasted scene, yet, there is no sense any more were needed.
Marsh is at once both the prototype and yet the quintessential of the Super Cop.
The town seems to be a very "upscale" slice of suburbia, yet still displays areas of blight and economic depression.
It's light-hearted and feel-good, yet the humor is definitively and enjoyably "R-rated".
The man's nice sister, incidentally, has contacted Holmes with her concernsÂthough she is not yet aware of the blackmail attempt.
I have yet to meet anyone one who's actually made it all the way through the film, most abandon it somewhere along the way as simply too much to take.
Something no other reviewer has noted on here yet is how well-done the whole thing is.
Four startlingly different lives, yet bound by fate to come together in one unexpected journey.
Great DVD for anyone getting into Queen or hardcore fans who do not own this instant classic yet.
I am always amazed when I find yet another ultra-low budget film starring Bela Lugosi.
:) Jackie Chan yet again.
It is also the kind of movie where characters talk about how important the item they are transporting is, yet they haul it around on an open flatbed.
), yet the homicidal spirit homing inside him makes him commit repulsive murders when he sleeps.
If you enjoy the horror genre, and have not yet seen this classic- try and get a copy.
If you have not yet purchased this show on DVD, keep "Vic Reeves Big Night Out" out of your DVD collection.
It was cheaply made, a minimal cast, yet for that it was honest and ridiculously hilarious.
I was disgusted by the lack of coordination, yet proud of the many rescue volunteers and the lengths they went to continue to rescue these helpless & sometimes trapped animals.
The villain I thought was better than before but he still said BS about six times during the beginning:) The music was very bizarre but yet it grows on you as the films goes on.
Memo to Warner Bros: Why hasn't this film come out on DVD yet?
It's light as a feather, yet professionally crafted.
Nothing new or inventive here but Goldie lights up the screen presenting a smart yet flawed character trying to live her dream.
From a liberal, secular humanist point-of-view, this movie keeps interest high by small amounts of conservative ranting interspersed with large amounts of liberal ranting (of course much more thoughtful, factual and balanced), animation and news clips too true yet too bizarre.
But even with the laughs that are obvious to come with such a given for scandalous material, including various movie clips featuring said word (Pulp Fiction, Punch-Drunk Love, South Park, Scarface), and even with the Presidential utterances and sound-bytes of the word (Nixon's the most obvious yet still unnerving), and even with some of the interviewees really giving some food for f***ing thought on the subject (Billy Connolly is arguably the funniest, with HST being low-key and observant, and Allen Keyes and Pat Boone delivering very straight-laced answers) with the two-side arguments, there doesn't seem quite enough here to be totally satisfying.
Some interesting points : - After half an hour of watching this movie, you feel like it still hasn't started but yet, at the same time, you feel like it's been playing for hours.
I saw other films at the festival (particularly "Fingerprints" and "Last Rites of the Dead") that were made for much less money and yet were a thousand times better.
THE MARSH is yet another scary movie to satisfy the apparently inexhaustible demand for fright films of this genre.
The events themselves which triggered the haunting were, once again, rather unimportant yet predictable and wholly unoriginal.
The star is given yet another memorable introduction - being signaled by his daughter of the presence of the law, representing their creditors, on his way to the train which is to take them to the next town; here, again, we have a daughter who is willing to forgive her rascally father his every whim and foible.
I think it's awful that so many of W.C. Fields' films are not yet released on DVD.
I have tried to find the video for sale, have not had luck as of yet.
Rising star Olivia De Havilland is pretty, elegant, charming and yet very resourceful as Maid Marian, and her chemistry with Robin Hood is electrifying.
I particularly admired the ending (spoiler ahead): sticking the "bindi" on George Washington's forehead - an excellent subtle invitation for a critical look on what drives work (and inevitably life) that the movie did not pretend to tackle head-on yet illustrated throughout: after all, placing the missing piece isn't foreign to Seattle.
Prince John conspires with Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and certain Norman Knights against his brother Richard the Lionheart so to become a King and oppresses the poor, yet faithful to Richard, Saxons.
Interestingly, three actors - Rathbone, Eugene Palette and Montagu Love - would go on to co-star together again in another equally renowned swashbuckler, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940; which I also just rewatched): Love, then, can be seen as well in yet one more similar film - the definitive 1937 version of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (which is forthcoming on DVD from Warners as part of a "Literary Classics Collection" and coupled with its inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake); incidentally, all of these classics virtually constitute the three top titles in the entire swashbuckling genre!
), THE MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1954; if only because it's directed by Val Guest), ROBIN AND THE 7 HOODS (1964; a musicalized version featuring The Rat Pack and reset to 1920s Chicago), A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD (1967; another Hammer Films variation), L'ARCIERE DI SHERWOOD (1970; a "Euro-Cult" obscurity directed by Giorgio Ferroni and starring Giuliano Gemma) and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (1993; the inevitable Mel Brooks spoof which, amazingly, I've yet to catch up with in its entirety!
Clark Kent, he's not Superman yet.)
Definately could've survived longer and it's a pity they have stuff like Knight Rider and Miami Vice and junk out to buy yet we have nothing to do with this show in our stores.
He's been portrayed as being unstoppable in the ring yet is clearly of limited wrestling ability.
They were not the type of movie you would bring home to show mom and dad, yet you still found a way to sneak it in.
"The Bridge" contains all that is important in a full length film, yet keeps the watcher entertained from beginning until end, with no dull, near pointless moments in between.
The ending, too, is not as dramatically climatic as one has been lead to suspect, but it is satisfying and quite haunting, resolving itself and yet is ambiguous enough to leave the viewer revisiting the tale in the mind's eye.
If you appreciated the banter between characters and intense yet subdued violence from Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, you'll like this movie.
This Duvall feature is quirky, touching, beautiful, odd, and by a man whose politics I do not at all like, yet I have to say that its qualities, including the camera work, the cutting, the music, the actors, the spoken script come close to creating a film Fellini would have been pleased to have authored.
Between the dancing and the hit-man underworld we move from light to dark and subsequently John J's character becomes difficult to like and yet difficult to dislike.
It is part of the ambiguity of Anderson's life, stepping on and off the stage that he must continually leave these and similar accounts open, yet he adds meaning to the lives of others and they his as he passes through....and as he takes lives.
He hides himself from the tango people he mingles with, and yet it is speaking with Manuela and her parents that he is most honest and sincere about himself and his feelings about tango and relationships.
They are placed in a situation like no other, yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.
If you haven't seen this film yet, you have missed a lot!
While I would love to see them stretch their wings and blow us away with fantastic comedic performances, they're not quite there yet.
towards the end - I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet!).
You may not recognize the name Tiffany Sinclair just yet but she has put plenty of potential on the screen with "Praey" and you should hear a lot from her in the near future.
And while it may seem to be yet another warning that war will destroy all that we love, its a warning we can not hear often enough.
She's not quite 'the full shilling' yet somehow has a soothing, calming effect on almost everyone she meets.
Especially after helping overcome a quite terrifying wild boar...this sequence was stunning, yet simplistic and I realised I was watching a master film maker open mouthed in near wonderment.
In yet another collaboration with director Anthony Minghella ("Cold Mountain," "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), Jude Law plays Will, an architect who, with his partner Sandy (Martin Freeman), has just set up shop in King's Cross, a London neighborhood that is on the cusp of being gentrified but which still is known for its high crime rate.
Why the robbers would come back to the scene of the crime a third time to commit yet the same crime in the same manner is beyond, I would think, the reach of most of the world's dumbest criminals, and these guys weren't that dumb.
And yet it is precisely in the center of one of the six nodes of film perfection.
Penn gave a delicate yet fierce performance particularly at the end, when she lashes out at Will for all the preceding predicaments that he had caused.
SPOILERS  But plausibility isn't something this film seems to want to care much about -- for example, the Luke character leaves a crime scene or shows up at the "West Hollywood Police Department" in a motorcycle, sans helmet without hearing word one about it from a "WH" cop; the Chaz character get not only sliced but decapitated on a crowded dance floor and no one notices, hears about it, or stumbles on him; Eddie ends up at the crime scene where his younger brother (whom he was earlier so concerned over and about) was killed, gets attacked there himself, goes to the "WHPD," runs into his sister and yet no one (not even the sister) mentions to him that his brother was the victim at that crime scene.
The basic story line wasn't too bad; but I have yet to see a great story line on crocs or gators.
The acting was terrible and as is the case in every single one of these idiotic movies, we get yet another son who doesn't like his dad and doesn't want to be there.
If you want to see a good terrible movie, than watch other Made for Sci Fi movies like Crocidile and Crocidile 2...They are much better yet still terrible.
The casting was also excellent, especially for Vlad, the attractive Rudolf Martin whose looks scream Dracula in this movie as they did in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"; and Lidia, the petite Jane March whose voice and looks expertly display the quiet yet strong religious character.
In her first movie role, I thought Kate Tsui did remarkably well in her role as Piggy, the newbie lacking field experience, yet being thrown in the deep end of the pool to sink or swim.
To those who enjoyed the first 3 "Phantasm" films, and haven't seen number 4 yet, I recommend to skip this sorry attempt of a sequel, since all it does is destroy some of the magic of is predecessors.
The animation isn't exactly KING KONG caliber - some of the dinosaurs look like rough clay, with no scale tone to the flesh, and some of them are remarkably stick-like, but it was early yet, and much of it is very good.
It's crude and not without some jagged timing due to the nature of how silent film (when not properly restored like the DVD I watched), yet there's never a dull moment once the action starts rolling around; only Wallace Beery can add to the fun as his reaction shots as 'Challenger' are as classic as the dinos themselves.
There are very few characters in this one b\c it focuses on The Tall Man's relationship with Mike (yet, of course, like the others not explaining all we need to know!).
The restoration involves the combining of 8 versions from around the world to give you the most complete version possible making this film one of the best restorations as of yet.
the series just gets better and better.dont want to spoil it for anyone who hasn`t seen it yet but it is the best ending yet.
To cap the iceberg, the ending (which I won't reveal, for fear of being declared a "spoiler" by the IMDB) is ponderous and inconclusive, leaving room for yet another sequel to keep this tired series alive.
Phantasm 2012 A.D. is a possible release for yet another Phantasm film.
The true beauty of his performance is the fact that we know how intelligent Oldman is; yet he is totally believable as this half-witted madman who is rushing towards his own demise.
She gets berated by all the townsfolk- particularly the religious folk for having a child out of wedlock and under such strange circumstances- yet nothing gets in the way of her own determination of what she thinks is true.
Just think of the staggering number of movies in any genre that are made every year for ten or twenty million, yet still are total garbage.
John Malkhovich also does his usual good job, playing Eliot, a man trapped in the machoistic World of Queens, yet struggling with his homosexuality.
Al's wife steals Al and all four or five of his buddies clothing, yet somehow he has spare clothing for all of them in his car.
And yet -- as so often with real life sociopaths -- we unaccountably have a degree of empathy for him that he never feels toward others.
And there need be no lingering questions about the future -- for even if things in the present unfold the way he wants them to, he would yet continue a path of destruction.
The armless man is yet another echo of the horrors of mutilated soldiers coming home from World War I and their inability to really assimilate and be accepted.
  I don't know about some of you people, but this is the most interesting phantasm yet.
I don't think anyone has spoiled it yet for the unwary so for an explanation of why, the best thing to do is watch it!
On the other hand, there's lots of action, the pace rarely flags, and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and given a vigorous whipping which, needless to say, has little effect on his defiant character.
They provide the unspoken, yet brilliantly encapsulated little "cheat" which brings a happy ending to this film.
Blinded by the partially self created rejection of his mate (the marriage's failure is entirely played out in one 30 second curbside scene and has as little credibility than Josh's subsequent "dates"), Josh meets nothing but sleazoids or those who have not yet "gotten their acts together."
Here, he gives a truly natural performance - he comes across as just another guy, dwarfed by the system yet refusing to give in to it.
Most of each character's decisions are partially justified and partly immoral, yet they all increase tensions and further flare up the fighting.
A leading critic had exclaimed that "Dev" is an average Film yet is Important.
For anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet... Go see it!
OVERALL: It isn't as good as "Phantasm" or "Phantasm II", but "Phantasm IV: Oblivion" is yet another satisfying entry to this amazing fantasy/horror series.
They have to struggle to accept the fact their young son was terminally ill yet remain strong enough to prepare him for his own death but they are also fighting the ignorance of how AIDS was perceived in the Eighties.
You don't need much imagination to do a remix of Tagore's "paagla hawa" (and it is the "in" thing these days); yet, the director fails even in this.
the best is perhaps the songs.paagla hawa is the best as its been remixed to suit our needs-the needs of the young generation and yet that need to make us realize the richness of our culture remains.i don't know whether its a deliberate attempt or not.but it sure serves the purpose.
Funniest instance involving the male morons, the fiancÃ© of one of the sisters complains eyes itching yet he dives into murky water.
None of the men suffer worse than the women, yet only the men come off as tough, while the women are basically weak and feeble.
I'm two into 2007 Horrorfest, and I have yet to be impressed.
There is a bit of dismay expressed by the RV owner's girlfriend, since her boyfriend has cheated on her numerous times, and he's not done yet, you can bet.
It seems he tries to help Mike and Reggie, yet he does pose a threat towards the end.
And as for direction we need look no further than scenes featuring the Almighty, sorry Mr Bannister, the Motel Room scene is excellent, especially the end:  CREATURE:(ON THE FLOOR)Wait, we aren't finished yet!
Beckinsale, even more radiant than usual, pulls off a nice characterization of the resourceful yet snobbish heroine.
This happened during a Baile dos Enxutos, which was not yet called a 'Gay Ball' then, at the teatro Republica, 1961.
That gap is a jagged edge for me, and yet I cannot propose a smoother ending or smoother inclusion of the personality of Madam Sata into the main.
I watched this movie expecting something about drag queens or someone who could be considered significant in some way, hence the "based on a true story" blurb in the description, yet I can't find any reason why anyone would have made a movie about the primary character.
I could not get a clear sense of whether he was lovers with Lurita or Taboo or they coexisted as a "family" unit of unwanted people who found comfort in each other, yet even then the primary character was so cruel to Taboo that it sickened me.
In doing so, Phantasm IV becomes the most atmospheric and haunting one yet.
Yanne looks like your typical working-class butcher, walking with a slouch, often discussing the horrors of war, but very mannered, guarded as to not say too much, yet appealing in a quiet way.
When it appeared in 1929, the clichÃ©s weren't yet clichÃ©s and this style of sports film was the rage.
During the editing process they apparently had not yet developed a way to make the splices on the sound-track noiseless.
The Doorway to Hell is yet another step up the ladder for James Cagney as the Brothers Warner discover that the guy they signed for a one shot deal to repeat his stage role from Penny Arcade was in fact future star material.
A pretty good crime drama of its time, on a par with PUBLIC ENEMY, LITTLE CEASAR, and others of the genre,good acting, too.Excellent acting by a very young Lew Ayres, an up-and-coming yet unknown James Cagney, here listed way down in the cast of players as a secondary, and I particularly enjoyed the fine characterization by pre-Dracula Dwight Frye.
As for the story, Warner Brothers takes yet another stab at the menace to society theme with it's take on mob violence and competition between rival gangs.
This is not a Terrence Mallick film, where a scene can compose of stillness yet resonate in tranquility and beauty.
Wow, at least 60 posts to this thread, most of which I haven't yet read.
Its one of those films that helps you understand how different and yet the same families are.
Radio Days (1987)- written, directed, and narrated by Allen:  What a beautiful, kind, gentle, ironic, warm, sentimental (in a very good way and yes, I am talking about Woody Allen's movie, that's right) yet perfectly balanced delight.
Diane Weist, Julie Kavner, Mia Farrow, Josh Mostel, a briefly-glimpsed Jeff Daniels, and a young Seth Green all give great performances that are right out of the period, yet instantly recognizable.
For instance, the opening twenty minutes or so, which are somewhat dark and violent, are followed by some broad, over-played comedy scenes (see the rather attractive, yet highly annoying, Mother).
Drive was made for a negligible budget, to a brutal schedule, yet the efforts of the cast & crew clearly show and the result is better than a thousand films that cost 10 times the price.
Mark Dacascos, who was the main villain that was most recently seen duking it out with Jet Li in 2003's "Cradle 2 the Grave," has starred in a number of action movies throughout the '90s, but has yet to achieve any stardom.
The movie hurtles from action sequence to action sequence, with deft direction from Steve Wang, who has yet to achieve mainstream success.
The story is beautifully basic and uncomplicated, yet never seems too simplistic or rehashed.
A biomechanically augmented ex-assassin and wise cracking bar-fly hardly seem the most likely pair yet this film manages to pull it off as it follows them running from bounty hunters, police and various explosions alike.
It wasn't boring, and yet, there was no solid resolution.
The story isn't very original as well, yet its brought with such enthusiasm and you can see that the actors all had a great time.
No sound, the character is still, and really nothing obvious goes on in the frame, yet you still get the feeling that Mosely has: "holysh*t, I just shot that guy."
The film spans only 12 days prior to the election, yet traverses far more issues and miles in its travel.
It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more.
I haven't yet found a use for old DVD's.
What is surprising is Mos Def's performance as the inscrutable yet amiable Eddie Bunker.
Hitch clearly hadn't learnt the art of subtlety yet and these are massively overused.
In this regard his technique was not yet refined.
Since Peter SellersÂ´ death in 1980, Blake Edwards seems to be the only person on the planet who hasnÂ´t gotten over it yet.
Spoofing porn movies in the '60s was kinda like writing sci-fi in the 1800s - the genre in contention didn't really exist yet.
Porn in 1968, pre-Throat/MissJones/Mona etc., hadn't yet developed the wah-wah guitar pizza delivery slo-mo money shot vocabulary we know and love to mock today.
Here she gets into yet more sexual situations, first being raped by a weird hunchback thief (Charles Aznavour) and later rather indecently frisked by a horny cop (Joey Forman).
Candy finally seeks refuge in the back of a truck, but it turns out to be the travelling home of sex-addicted guru Grindl (Marlon Brando)... and, yes, you've guessed it, he too takes advantage of the over-sexed yet ever-innocent girl.
The main story in the movie is that he (Bruce) has roughly 2 hrs to transport a prisoner from the cell block to the court house, yet the cops are trying to stop him.
King Kong, for example, is slow in the beginning, yet I love it.
2001: A Space Odessy and The Birds are very slow, yet I find them good movies.
Like Bruce calls for some help, yet not only do they never show up, but they're never mentioned again.
Far too many times, the bad guys were able to guess exactly where Bruce was going, yet it seems way to perfect.
The emotion that appears later in the film is yet another good addition to this motion picture, though it may very much upset others.
While I've yet to view the latter, the contrast between the two is startling.
If you can remember the imaging from the underwater portion of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, then you can visualize the bottom of Loch Ness, yet Russell's lake bottom is of a bluish color.
They may not come around all that often, yet the occasional meaningful movie will stick with you.
Rather than portray Saladin as the ruthless yet often merciful Muslim military mind, Keith and the film portray Saladin very similarly to a European crusader.
Anyway, THE CRUSADES is another notable achievement (from the days prior to the epic heyday of the 1950s and 1960s) which goes to prove Â yet again Â that De Mille was perhaps cinema's greatest purveyor of hokum disguised as inspirational art for the masses (even if this particular example, reportedly, flopped at the box-office).
goes through some interesting, yet oddly believable, tangents during the course of the film.
TRAPPED ASHES was yet another bumpy ride.
This is one of Bruce Willis' finest films yet.
It promised introspection, scope, meaning, and a bit of beauty, yet the first three were still-born, and the last ruined by triteness.
Only that the gangster genre does not yet exist in mainland Chinese cinema and the director has to breathe life to the genre by consulting Western models.
The directing is fluid and seamless yet does not draw attention to itself.
Zhang Yimou's attempt to squeeze yet another Chinese history lesson into one of his movies aside, I still came away unexpectedly moved by "Shanghai Triad."
The ending of the film is as brutal as anything you might expect to see, and yet there is a kind of poetic justice in what happens.
My life was honestly changed as that half an hour was a real time anomoly, obeying the theory of relativity and breaking that particular convention by immersing me so fully that it seemed to last forever and yet, not long enough.
By now though, I have Lantern in such a high regard that it borders on gaining a mythical quality as I have yet to see it in it's entirety.
The highlight is a hilarious sequence where Harold, left suicidal by yet another rejection, tries to find ways to do the deed.
With the exception of, for instance, Â´There is something about MaryÂ´ I have yet to laugh once while watching these exercises in psychological torture.
Deeds yet but it does look hilarious
As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.
Robot Chicken is one of, if not the funniest show on television right now, and yet most people I know have never even heard of it.
Mason is very good but the depth of his abilities was as yet untapped.
Moore and Glenne Headly (in her best performance yet) are amazing, and Willis is excellent too in support.
The story is that of two friends, Joyce and Cynthia who find they have to cover up a killing (NOT a murder, but at worst a manslaughter, or better yet, a case of self-defense), but fall apart as the investigation closes in on them.
But better yet, YOU watch it and you be the judge.
Nothing makes sense: Silva recites his lines like he's talking to a 3-year-old, Muller is glib at all the wrong times (he's strung up and about to be killed by Strode, and he keeps asking for a beer), weeks seem to go by, yet Silva (who, despite his top billing, has hardly any screen time after the opening sequence) and the people at the CIA always seem to be wearing the same wardrobe, and Muller & Silva even kiss at one point.
The action takes place in a small, enclosed camp, with Muller and the girl running from building to building, yet Strode and the most poorly-trained, inefficient platoon this side of "Gomer Pyle USMC" can't seem to see them, and even when they do, they all run after them one at a time, enabling Muller to easily dispose of them.
So much has changed in 61 years, and yet they remain the same.
That the film provides no easy resolutions yet plenty of optimism for these truly modern Korean women is the year's most pleasant K-cinema surprise: it allows the protagonists an honesty and resolve in deciding their own fates that many recent K- comedies seem hell-bent on denying similar characters.
In a real sense, women have not yet received full honor for their contribution to the war effort, whether they were ferrying planes, tending wounded, of carrying intelligence.
There are many scenes that had the quality of a dream, but yet seemed like they were supposed to be taken for real.
She tries to be protective of Debbie (Thurman) when she sees her being hurt by yet another bad relationship.
Debby's mother Virginia(Rowlands) is strong, yet her daughter's resentment to her new boyfriend lead to her own remorse when the boyfriend died of a heart attack.
Worse yet are the stereotypical reactions of his family.
Skynet is computers and robots yet they have a sophisticated laboratory with tables?
Skynet develop sophisticated flying machines yet they also build motorbikes utilising the combustion engine?
The resistance seems to have limitless access to ammunition, fuel, arms etc, yet they have no factories to produce them?
Perhaps the script for "Tomorrow is Yesterday" has not yet been been played out.
Then a bit later Spock informs the Captain that the pilot's son plays an important part in space travel history so they MUST return the pilot ASAP--especially since at this point, the pilot hasn't yet sired any kids.
Its really hard to contain myself when I'm talking to friends who haven't seen it yet who ask me how it was.
However, if you haven't yet, you really should do yourself the favor of checking it out.
Terminator 3 was terrible, yet a lot of people still liked it.
There is much potential for this to be made into a great film with flashes of brilliant ideas - a young homosexual who sells himself for sex lives with his budding opera singer of a sister; yet this relationship is barely touched upon, and her character barely developed.
We are given glimpses into a female writer's life, yet the reason why she is a writer is of little to no importance to the story, and there is only a suggestion of what she writes.
Manu, for example, is basically a happy-go-lucky kid who's just beginning to find his way in life and who demonstrates that he has a tremendous capacity for joie de vive and emotional tenderness - even if his youth and inexperience occasionally lead him to hurt others in ways that he doesn't yet fully comprehend.
Are we to think, in witnessing in the final scene yet another peaceful picnic at the river, that everything is as it was before?
For someone looking for a much gentler yet highly gripping tale of gay love this is a film I would highly recommend.
What is a blown-up plastic Barbie doll doing in a movie that is situated in the early eighties, when plastic surgery was not even properly born yet??
This is yet another triumph for AndrÃ© TÃ©chinÃ© - a film that deserves the widest possible audience.
There is something radical about TÃ©chinÃ©'s ability to avoid a central action or central character, yet keep things interesting--even more interesting because of the unpredictability of the interactions and an openness toward behavior the straight world tends to see as forbidden or transgressive.
Johan LibÃ©reau is touching as the doomed Manu, fleshing out what seems to me to be a somewhat idealised character - unreflective but sensitive, foolhardy yet vulnerable.
Silent Waters is a strong indictment of the intolerance and the abuse of women caused by religious differences, yet its potential is not fully realized.
This film is stripped of all the glitz and glamour yet still it manages to be a beautiful portrayal of the harsh reality of life.
She is strikingly intense yet thankfully subdued as the single aging mother of a young boy named Saleem who is coming of age and has begun to keep secrets from her.
The visuals in these flashbacks are not very distinct, very much like Ayesha's memories which are old and unclear, yet unforgotten.
The mind knows that what it sees are actors and yet it refuses to believe what it knows.
At the every end, it refers to the current version of an old story under yet another General, Musharaf.
Though an influence of Iranian new wave cinema is seen on film maker sabiha sumer yet it is an original piece.
This is much better humor, drama and better visuals than 800 and yet in the same comic book-style genre.
The main problem of Shoot em' Up is that it had to follow after similar yet amazing powerhouse action flicks like Kill Bill, Sin City, and Grindhouse.
You know this film is going to be crazy yet delicious when you see a steamy sex scene and a violent shoot out at the exact same time.
(Although the awful 2004 "Punisher" movie included some supporting characters and plot points that originated with Ennis, it lacked anything resembling his very dark yet fiercely entertaining style.
Best of all, the screenplay manages to both glorify in and yet subvert some of the things you'll be expecting.
Yes, it is a ridiculous film filled with non-stop action that would never be humanly possible, babies being thrown around but yet staying protected by the humorous Mr. Smith.
Still, I am hoping the producers haven't given up on this one yet...
"The Return of Michael Campion" with Patrick O'Neal - about a man that holidays on a remote island - yet all the locals know him and dislike him!!!
It more than holds its own against Twilight Zone, yet the comparison truly is apples-oranges.
Especially because, at that point, the cameramen probably didn't yet know anything about how tepid the story lines and how ridiculous the plot of "Mako: The Jaws of Death" actually were!
Written words from the survivors would be read by future celebrities who are sure to emphasise pain and hate...more pain and hate...and yet, more pain and hate.
Because if we all just sit there like sheep stunned into submission - then we deserve yet another installment of prefabricated plasticity shoved down our throats.
Winner of '99s Best New British Film Award in the Birmingham Film & TV Festival, it's essentially a bleak and unsentimental look at disjointed lives in a big city, yet very rewarding
Unlike "Happiness" in which Solondz wallows in the depravity of social misfits, Winterbottom valiantly offers a redemptive glimpse of humankind, in which despite all adversity, there is still hope yet.
It's more real life-ish, more emotional, less superficial and yet just as fun.
The score was absolutely brilliant -- one of the best matched soundtracks to a movie I've yet come across.
Unfortunately I have not seen the other movies of his filmography yet and I am not sure whether they are available in Brazil.
Michael Nyman turns out his most subtle and restrained music score yet.
So if you haven't seen this show yet, watch it, I'm sure you'll like it because I do.
The problem with kikyo is that she's a dead priestess who, in the past life, loved the half human/half demon and now wants him dead yet still claims she loves him.
It could have been the best Terminator yet.
Since this was a test screening, the sound was still a little rough and the time code had yet to be removed, both of which proved to be a bit distracting.
I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from "Apocalypse Now", even in the future).
Next stop if you haven't already seen it yet should be Babenco's "Ironweed".
Babenco has managed to put the brilliant, powerful, tough yet tender Brazilian best-seller by Drauzio Varella into a movie that must have been very difficult to shoot but that was handled firmly, with courage, great care and talent.
Strong, heavy, and yet not as real as it could be, Carandiru will impress mostly the international public with the story of a place where "the only thing more important than freedom is survival".
But it's a good, solid, non moralistic or stereotyped and yet entertaining prison movie which manage to transport the non-Brazilian viewer to feel the noises, the colors, even the scents of a lively, desperate and merciless world in which good and evil, guilt and innocence are inextricable.
The human soul can survive the most unheard of cruelties and repression, yet still have the capability to hope and dream even the biggest dreams.
This young girl who has recently regained her voice, yet is still afraid to use her new found freedom, is our hero.
Vulnerable, yet able to pull it together.
Adam Goldberg is compelling as the sarcastic yet witty American boyfriend visiting Paris for the first time with his girlfriend.
The film is peppered with brilliant moments from the awkward to the bizarre and the laughs come thick and fast, with Paris as a backdrop the lovers weave in and out of one situation to another always in love yet always on the verve of break-up.
I personally don't feel that the film ever crossed the line into becoming exploitative or gratuitous - instead opting for a realistic and confrontational yet "respectful" approach.
I would have, but I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Gregg Araki - yet.
The story is quite good yet in no way is the material enough to cover the breadth and scope of more than one film - which is one of the major problems with this Hammer entry.
And yet it's so much more heartfelt, kind-hearted, and yes, even "loving", than that aforementioned hyper-toxic indictment of New Jersey suburbia.
And yet Araki handles it with such grace, strangeness, and "you-are-there" subjectivity, there's no way you can dismiss it as pornography.
(You'll probably recognize this guy...he's super-creepy looking, and yet also terrifyingly cool & inscrutable...he played Capone's main henchman Frank Nitti in THE UNTOUCHABLES) He joins the John back at his stark-white apartment, and a scene which seems destined for tension, dread and horror...suddenly becomes beautiful, incredibly sad, and transcendent.
A long way from "3rd Rock", Joe's sensuous flirtations and dynamic eyes mate well with Brady's tranquil, naive, yet profound, disposition.
Not mysterious in a boring, unoriginal way, where the screenwriter screws you around with information; mysterious in the way that the characters are opening up in front of you, and yet they're still enigmas; their depths hidden in plain view.
It is light hearted and easy to follow for most any age yet has enough comic relief for adults to be entertained from the gnomes.
So many things are laughable in it, yet it is not annoying, or not that much anyway...
Now I'm sure I didn't miss anything, I was paying attention but Mircalla was a really honest to god vampire, yet mincing around in the sunshine as she did she'd have been a crispy critter in 2 seconds.
This film is not yet out on VHS or DVD so if you get a chance to watch in on TV then I recommend you tape it to watch at a later date.
It's a compact piece that looks like it was fun to shoot and yet has all the impact of a much larger project.
In his role as the steward in a scene featuring a commuter airplane, Liebling delivers another of his subtle - yet, scintillating - tour de force performances.
When Liebling chose to leave California for a quiet, yet idyllic, life in Vermont, filmdom lost one of it's most treasured - yet inexplicably under-appreciated - players.
(I can no longer watch TV chefs without wondering) It is refreshing to see a film using 'low tech' filming techniques, which in this case created a normal yet off kilter ambiance which suited the English style black humour of the production perfectly.
The ever reliable Henry Goodman is great as the TV chef whilst the always watchable and very underrated Neil Stuke delivers yet another good comedy performance as the leader of the hostage takers.
And emptiness, a cinematic vastness that even the US hasn't yet produced, despite Terence Malick.
As for the artwork, it is simplistic yet acceptable.
This movie is quite different from his major movies, that everyone loves, but If you're a big Mike Myers' fan like me and you haven't seen it yet, go ahead and rent it.
As the lead Charlie McKenzie and as his father Stuart, Myers keeps the film moving with his paranoid yet irresistible charm from Charlie and his Robin Williamsesque quips that flow from his two characters accomplishing the most difficult task for such a performance; namely, entertain without distracting from the story.
If you liked "You Can't Take it With You" you'll love this more contemporary yet equally quirky film of love and family.
So I Married An Axe Murderer is one of the funniest yet scary romantic comedies of 1993.
Mike Myers, in a dual role as the neurotic but romantic Charlie McKenzie and Charlie's cantankerous father, gives the best performance I've seen from him so far (I've yet to see the "Austin Powers" movies but I didn't especially care for "Wayne's World," maybe because I couldn't stand Dana Carvey or his character).
And yet, my memories of it are crystal clear.
In 1951, Rosa Parks had not yet declined to move to the back of the bus, the schools had yet to be desegregated, and pleas for racial equality were generally spurned as part of a `pinko' agenda.
Not only was the Bava film made before Wes Craven's 1972 shocker LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but such retitlings imply that this film is yet another Italian rip-off of an American hit.
The murders themselves are shocking, yet Bava provides a bizarre sense of poetry to them.
many years ago on Cable TV â in fact, back when I wasnât yet a Euro-Cult devotee and, consequently, ended up being rather lukewarm on it.
"A Bay Of Blood" is extremely gory, yet very stylish, and maintains a morbid and gripping atmosphere throughout its 85 minutes.
At any rate Reazione a catena is classic Bava, some of the great directors finest work in fact, and an excellent example of the Italian horror genre for those who have yet to discover it.
I just see nothing all that spectacular about this film aside from it's undeniable shaping of the slasher genre, yet it is just plain forgettable and the gore effects aren't anything to marvel over either.
This Bay of Blood is something completely different yet again.
This film took me by surprise - I confess I was expecting yet another low-budget-low-interest indie flick, but Kisses & Caroms doesn't fall in such category.
I'm not sure if this is out yet in the movies.
It is fun but yet has some very real meaning.
This fun little romp into the world of billiards is just as good or better than many films I've seen in all the various video stores and yet I had to schmooze my way into obtaining a screener copy.
and you say she coulndt have possibly made any movies before she turned 16 , yet she was penthouse pet in September 84 and the story read she had starred in dozens of porn movies , so she starred in dozens of porn movies prior to September yet her first movie according to you wasn't produced and released until late 84 ?
All the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie.
I have yet to recommend this movie to a friend who didn't enjoy it.
Me, well I am 1/4 French, 1/16 Lakota Sioux, and 1/16 Nez Perce, yet 100% American Purebred Mutt.
From yet another perspective, its surprisingly surreal elements, both in direction and camera work, lift it into that rarefied ozone layer of a classic Art film (in English but with a Gallic sensibility).
The only problem I did have, is at the end, he refers to himself in the first person as if he was somehow part of the story, yet it was never revealed which character he was, (a good guess would be he was the lead Deputy).
Wallace Berry is infuriating as the hard headed business man, yet he keeps from being a one dimensional bad guy.
I was delighted to find out that the film is still a grand piece of soapdish entertainment, and if you have yet to delved into Hollywood's early classic period of film-making, this MGM production provides a nice starting point.
Edmund Goulding's Oscar-winning 'Grand Hotel (1932)' is a mere snapshot of several days in the life of Berlin's finest rest-stop, in which lives are changed forever, and yet the guests' full stories can never be known.
Perhaps Garbo hadn't yet moved on from the silent era, communicating her emotions with thick brush-strokes, but when your face can so dazzlingly light up the movie screen, there's no hurry.
She hardly ever appeared to be acting, yet every gesture she made and every word she spoke was magnificently overdone -- as would have been necessary during her silent roles.
The script (which was originally a play) is filled with both wit and insight (yet no Oscar nod?).
The brilliant supporting performances of a young, fresh Joan Crawford as Flaemchen, the stenographer, and Lionel Barrymore as the dying Kringelein deserved Oscars but the category hadn't been invented yet.
Her performance is so atrociously mannered I can see Jennifer Jason Leigh easily out-doing her, but better, more authentic (anyone who recalls her exacting yet eccentric portrayal of Dorothy Parker can easily see her becoming and improving Garbo).
Then she capriciously takes on with the Baron von Geigern (a dashing yet shady John Barrymore) who is more interested in her jewels but tells her he could love her; he out-acts her at every turn with subtlety and genuine charm even when his part seems underwritten.
Three very different roles yet Lionel Barrymore imprints his personality on every one.
This is a film about the conflict between the Turks and the Armenians, yet in the film all the commentators are from Turkey plus some from its geopolitical ally, the US.
The deaths are over the top yet fit right for this particular flick.
Jason Goes To Hell:The Final Friday is titled a little weirdly in that New Line had just bought the franchise and yet they claimed to only make one movie out of it?
Seemingly unstoppable and indestructible killer Jason Voorhees (hulking behemoth Kane Hodder in peak menacing form) finally gets blown to bits by the feds in an ambush, but he ain't down for the count just yet.
Directed by Nick Quested who also has a role in the film as Deputy Carry I thought Seven Mummies was yet another below average, nothing special, utterly forgettable & stupid low budget shot on digital horror film that steal most of it's ideas from better films such as From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) amongst others.
Not that they would allow themselves to be seduced by this deeply moving yet quietly disturbing film in the first place.
I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best Â yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it.
Unlike her later 1930s films, Crawford is wild and free here, sort of like a Trilby yet to find her Svengali.
Amusingly, while Bone Crusher and E-40 are advertised as staring in it, yet they aren't in the movie for very long-Bone Crusher appears in the beginning as a patron in a strip club so tame it could have passed for MTV's "The Grind", then disappears.
if you aren't a fan of Robbie yet, you will become after watching the show!
I just couldn't figure out why he didn't it make big in the U.S. Maybe the American audiences are not just ready yet...
Cagney and Chaney looked totally different, yet Cagney makes this role work.
I characterize Jet Lag as cotton-candy entertainment: utterly unsubstantial, yet fluffy and tasty enough to leave me wanting more.
Hollywood 'realism' has never been more obvious or watered down than here, yet the film still manages to give off a quaint charm and appeal that makes it bearable today.
I was a little bit afraid, I can't really take yet another sugar-filled love story on the airplane, but this movie was really different.
Juliette Binoche shows her talent in a totally different role to most of the ones she has played before, she is a common girl with many problems and yet her nobility and class shine through.
Danielle Thompson's "Decalage Horaire" is a simple, yet not necessarily simplistic, ode to love.
A special note on the music (no pun intended), it's by far the best score in a Swedish movie yet.
Find any of this funny yet?
The more traditional horror villains are very satisfying, with an interesting, unusual yet immediately recognizable look, and they are worked into the backstory of the characters extremely well.
Horst Frank is a lot of fun to watch as the deranged, yet urbane bad guy, while George Eastman is good and nasty too.
Rather he is a multi-dimensional, charismatic, lovable yet ultimately flawed individual caught up in the money-hungry giant that is Hollywood.
And yet, as it began to build momentum, A STAR revealed itself to be a very wonderful film, quite different from its remake.
Lionel Stander ('Moidah' Max from HART TO HART) is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful, yet, we must admit, very funny.
Consider PETA, which is opposed to all types of animal testing for medical research, yet their vice president, Mary Beth Sweetland is a diabetic who uses insulin made from animal products to keep her alive.
This has got to be one of the most AMAZING films ever made, not only for the astounding cinematography, the quiet, subtle, yet overpowering drama, the incredible pacing of the story, the compelling character portraits, but also for very intelligently conceived cinema verite techniques.
If anything, it can be seen as a silent film, one that tells its story in mute yet powerful images, and in doing so, gets its message across.
What an incredibly vast, unforgiving, yet hauntingly mesmerizing landscape, and Lu Chuan takes full advantage of this.
What this film does so well is connect you with the protagonists in a simple, yet very effect manner.
We sense their fear and pessimism as they struggle to survive in this breathtakingly beautiful, yet ultimately deadly landscape.
This is mostly due, I believe to, the director Philippe Mora and Christopher Walken's quirky yet memorable acting presence.
He's one of the greatest actors in the world, yet a lot of fans want to turn every one of his performances as a joke, and make fun of him and/or just not take his work seriously.
And yet it offers truly surreal alien encounter scenes that are interesting to watch.
Lindsay Crouse, however, seems rather miscast in the role of the supportive yet frustrated wife, not that she doesn't give it some effort.
If you manage to get a hold of this rarely seen gem which hasn't been released on DVD as yet, you're quite sure to spend a very enjoyable time, trying to guess the perpetrator of the villainy and feasting your eyes on the rosy cheeks and elegant gowns of the damsel in distress.
Contemporary reports indicate that Wood was a racist and an unpleasant man who founded some very dubious political causes, yet his films consistently show solid proficiency and some subtle symbolism.
I firmly believe that if this movie is shown in schools there may yet be hope for a future for Caucasians everywhere.
We all recognise elements of them either in ourselves or in others yet how to describe them?
he pulls of with incredible emphasis, yet a monotone voice.
Let's consider the following: * We don't find out how the ants became mutated until halfway through the film, and then this information comes from a "super secret" federal agency, and yet podunk sheriff is apparently special enough to get the scoop.
In this scene Paddys facial expressions and disgusted, angry yet kind of deeply hurt way of talking is priceless.
Overall his character appears kind of twisted... a cold avenger who uses what he learned in military and takes harsh and precise planned revenge (the "drug party" is some pretty heavy stuff although it doesn't use any gory shockers)... yet he seems deeply hurt and vulnerable which in the end turns out to be true and still the worst revenge on one of the thugs.
One one hand using what seemed to be actual houses; yet on the other, staged set pieces.
This is the only version of Jane Eyre that I've seen yet.
Firstly, the '73 version has the weaker script, which very often stays too close to the novel for is own good, yet at times diverts unnecessarily from the literary model.
Jayston plays wonderfully the role: all the attributes that Bronte wrote about her hero are well argued by Jayston's fine, subtle and clever acting: tortured spirit, sometimes stern and abrupt, sometimes kind and genial, eccentric, good story-teller, full of passion, masterful, yet submissive in Jane's presence, with deep and mellow voice, and playing a cat-mouse game with Jane.
Michael Jayston is the perfect Mr. Rochester - he looks the part, attractive yet not too pretty, and able to convince us of his hidden good qualities under a rough and abrasive exterior.
The music for instance doesn't always seem to suit the situation, A+ for effort, but it just wasn't there yet.
Simpson in front of a sex-starved black female jury - yet she still has doubts.
You've got Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck and Alexis Smith in a film and yet it stinks.
When i noticed this movie had not yet even been reviewed by its release date, I knew it was going to flop.
All of this and yet the mission's target ends up escaping the captors and finding its way back in bed next to Crock.
To Pamelyn, "thanks for the memories" and hopefully this movie will be on again so I can see it from the beginning or better yet, obtain a copy for my collection.
He sees the girl's image, he hears her voice - and then, during a sÃ©ance, a wax replica of her hand appears in water, with verifiable fingerprints yet!
I'm a Christian yet I really liked Monty Python's movie.
Immigrants contribute 100 billion to California's economy yet take only 3 billion.
It has the basic plot of a revenge film, maybe even of a slasher film, yet is not a thriller, nor a horror film.
Patrick is a kid (by kid I mean a guy who looks to be in his 30's) stuck in a kind of waking comma, unable to move or speak, yet fully sentient of the world around (and not around) him.
Shot very effectively in a style somewhere between Italian neo-realism, early Scorsese and even Cassavettes improv but with a flavor all its own, it doesn't matter that one of the plot twists is very obvious (so obvious, in fact, I'm not even sure that it's even meant to be a twist) because co-writer Paddy Considine is such a riveting yet natural presence in the lead: he's able to be genuinely threatening while keeping it absolutely real, creating a very believable monster.
It's not exactly a scene rich in dramatic promise, yet when it comes to disarming your prejudices, Krige proves an expert.
This is strictly amateur hour in every single connotation of the word.For something similar, yet a billion times better, do yourself a favor and rent "the Toolbox Murders" instead (the original NOT the remake)   Eye Candy: Staci Gordon & Kit Mitchell get topless (Kit is also topless in the DVD outtakes); Shelly York shows tits & a bit of bush (word of caution: John Rudder shows his ass and penis)   My Grade: D-   Synapse DVD Extras: A 25 minute interview with Director Terry Loften; an 8 & a half minute outtake reel (with no film audio but with comments from the director) ; & Promotional trailer for this film
There's other low budget films that are much funnier such as The Suckling and They Don't Cut The Grass Anymore (the acting is worse than Nail Gun Massacre, yet more hilarious).
All this during a brief intro and the best is yet to come!
The story is waferthin yet dealing with quite an important issue that I had no idea about.
Well I haven't yet watched this movie but I would surely like to watch it.
I can't think of anyone else who could present such a despicable character - an extreme misogynist, and yet keep the audience laughing even during his hateful diatribes against women.
And yet: this movie isn't about loathing; it's about forgiving.
Early films didn't even have credits attached, and yet audiences recognized a Griffith film anyways.
The congenial leads make the viewer empathise with their plight, yet it is understood that there will be no happy ending.
If you have not seen it yet, try to avoid spoilers and stop reading these reviews!
And Sam's story is yet another grand edition to the immigrant history of the U.S. and Canada.
this is a Masterpiece ...god it almost made me cry..please vote good for this movie ..this movie deserve to be on the top instead of stupid movies like "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984) and lots of other not so deserving titles on top 250 films list on IMDB...Steve McQueen is at his best as Papillon...great story and overall an excellent picture..if you haven't seen it yet ,do not hesitate you owe that to yourself if you are a movie fan and don't forget to vote after you watched it we have to have this movie on Top 250 films list..Don't you agree with me?
It's a fairly large role, the actor makes a strong impression, yet (almost as important) the filmmakers don't showcase him in a self-congratulatory way ("Look how progressive we are!").
His claim he was innocent of murder, may be true enough, due to an unreliable source accusing him in court, yet producing little supporting evidence.
But there can be no doubt that STEVE McQUEEN and DUSTIN Hoffman create believable and sympathetic (yet quirky) characterizations and do some of the finest acting of their careers.
I guess this is reasonable, as on the regular Muppet Show, because the songs may not be very familiar yet to the young audience.
The ending is predictable, yet satisfying.
What remains is an almost painful experience for every actor present, shown in their faces in almost every scene yet simultaneously used as "the pain" of working in a grocery store to give them character.
I thought this was an incredible film with a story that was in many ways simple, yet complex in dealing with redemption.
Both men do an incredible job acting dumb and yet civalized.
Bill Murrey was the original choice for the role of Bernard Berkman, yet Jeff Daniels still manages to play the role perfectly with highly comedic one liners.
As an intimate snapshot of a family in transition, not only do questions go unanswered, but the 'ending' really isn't an ending at all...yet this story really doesn't need one.
The majority of observations from Walt's mouth are direct quotes from his father, yet instead of revealing the depth of admiration Walt has for his father these comments simply show Walt as being shallow and pathetic.
Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist any longer - yet to know it.
It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.
Bernard, a very sardonic critical yet loving man, is taking it very internally despite his sarcastic remarks about everything to his sons as a sounding board in his attempt to keep his boys together by a joint custody agreement with Joan by taking a fixer-upper brownstone across the park while he deals with the likelihood that his new book will never be published.
Joan's affairs are discovered shockingly by the boys - Walt the more avuncularly bitter lashing out and blaming her for not giving the marriage a chance reasoning that dad's lack of success has made her seek another shot a life of empty sex yet promise in her undiscovered writing talents (much to the resentment of Bernard); meanwhile budding tennis pro wannabe Frank, the youngest, begins to experiment with alcohol and masturbation.
No one is totally to blame, yet no one is completely innocent either in this honest and frank film.
So if you like movies that are stupid yet funny this is a great one to watch.
I liked 1, 3, and 6 and I have yet to see 2, 5 and 7 (I hear 7 is much worse than this)   The movie is about an author named Marie (Played by Romy Windsor) who after a nervous breakdown, is sent to the town of Drago, along with her husband Richard.
One dumb plot-hole is that Weiss bought (not rented) this home in the woods, and yet neither he nor his wife had ever seen it.
It is suppose to be a werewolf film yet we don't even see one until after an hour of Marie just walking about the town and occasionally hearing howling noises coming from the woods.
At one point, Christian Slater is wearing a ski mask with eye holes, and the female scientist sprays him in the eyes with yellow spray paint (the SAME spray paint she already used to see his vein) and yet, for some odd reason, the spray paint only made the mask yellow around the holes, it didn't make his eyelids visible.
At the end of the day,i have seen worse,but also a lot better,Facinelli and Regan do well in their roles,and for Christian Slater,he yet again made this movie worthwhile for me,despite the fact you only hear his voice.It doesn't really get your immediate attention,but if you be patient i think you will agree that this movie is actually worth watching.I particularly enjoyed the scene outside of Regans house,smart effects with the flash grenades,i gave this movie a rating of 7/10,which i feel it deserves.I read a comment from another user that has the opinion that Christian Slater cant act!Which is an insult to myself,i own every Movie that Christian Slater is in except Name Of The Rose!And i can ASSURE you that this man is a Very talented actor.
It felt like a rushed cash in on the original, yet came out six years later !
But yet he isn't something to fear away from the movie because of.
Anyway, to get to the main item: the film can be seen as a modern variation on the perennial "Pygmalion" theme Â with Segal as intellectual but, at the same time, neurotic and Streisand the uncouth yet liberated woman.
The sex-talk is dated now, and the picture looks like a relic from the late-'60s, yet it's a funny film about opposites.
I think I've seen some or most of Farley's films and I still haven't even settled on a favorite (most and least) yet.
When that annoying tiger shark kills yet another one of his girlfriends, Steven gets really upset goes after his nemesis.
The plot is simple yet effective, the acting is what you would expect from a 70's movie.
First off, I'm an American -- I haven't seen any comments on IMDb about this series yet from a U.S. viewer.
These are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that American flotsam such as "Grey's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spoons out.
Two FBI agents, one a by-the-book fellow, the other a people smart man who was raised in Mississippi begin an investigation on it yet no one wants 'outsiders' around, thus trouble starts brewing.
The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings.
And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it.
Mississippi Burning is a film much garlanded with awards, yet the charge about its uneasy focus on the fate of white activists is one that sticks.
This film spoke to a teleological focal point that may beyond grasp for so many of us, yet much like an accident on the highway, we can't resist watching.
In this subtle, yet unsettling compilation of "home movies" created by Wayne & Andrea Montgomery, filmmaker Anthony Spadaccini affirms his instinctive aptitude for creating both a successful cinematic showpiece and an unnerving playground for his actors to perform.
The first song "Tinka Tinka" is wonderfully subdued yet stirring and will stick with the viewer for long after viewing the movie.
I'm now 23, and have yet to find anything to top it.
I know, I know: yet more nepotism in movies.
I think Matthew Perry had't made it to rehab yet because during certain scenes he looks too thin and pale.
I can recommend this movie as a light yet insightful entertainment.
Better yet, stay out of her way!
Here you have a successful, yet pompous British author who goes to France to unwind, who however, gets to be roommates with the boss' daughter.
Sarah Morton(Charlotte Rampling) is very successful, yet she is unhappy.
This movie was very intriguing, yet very disturbing at the same time.
FranÃ§ois Ozon revisits the pairing of a young woman with an older one of his brilliant and haunting Regarde la mer (1997) n a whimsical parody of a serial detective writer , Charlotte Rampling as Sarah, an Agathe Christi like authoress, you know, in whose pages the bodies pile up like cordwood but no one is really hurt, attempting to find lost inspiration for yet another iteration.
The women's tacit sexual comparisons are also played out in a series of Oedipal symbols and exchanges Most striking is a gash of a red lilo that sits menacingly and yet enticingly by the pool throughout; the men that Julie brings back to the house are also pawn-like, less sexual partners than bargaining chips between the two women.
It is a nice contradiction that Sarah is very wealthy on the outside yet starving (for good food, sexuality, a zest for living, creativity) on the inside.
"Hell of the Living Dead" and "Rats: Nights of Terror", for example, are both terrible, yet they form essential viewing for fans of Italian horror cinema.
I have not yet seen The Red Shoes, so I was not shocked or disappointed how much the sequence resembled the earlier film.
Next in sequence there is the story of a teacher (played by Leslie Caron) who hasn't known love yet.
I would most certainly recommend this film to anybody who has yet to see an episode of Airwolf, the best acting in the film is by Jan-Michael Vincent- who plays moody loner Stringfellow Hawke, and David Hemmings- The choppers insane creator Charles Moffat.
'He Did and He Didn't' is an astonishing film: quite removed from the lowbrow slapstick of Arbuckle's early Keystone efforts, yet still extremely funny.
This is all fairly interesting because at the time this film was made Castro had not yet been declared enemy number 1 by the US.
They had some very funny routines in this movie, some of their funniest in fact, I have not seen one Abbott and Costello routine yet that I did not think was funny.
You can't take her eyes off of herÂa bit like watching the Indy 500 and secretly dreading yet anticipating a fatal crash, all the while captivated by the sheer beauty of the event.
She has only four or five very brief scenes, and yet, she manages to turn her little part into award-winning material.
It was meant to appear to be a psychological thriller, yet, ultimately, it's something else; the kind of "now you see it -- now you don't" that normally doesn't happen in inexpensive, quickly made movies.
This film is about Maya, yet it also applies to every other ancient civilization.
In that case, this film itself is an apocalypto lest we forget how different yet common we are compared to our ancestors.
First of All, I couldn't finish watching Sin City simply because it glorified senseless violence and I hate senseless violence, and yet its on the top 100 list-go figure.
Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.
I have yet to see the sequels "The Kiss Of Her Flesh" and "The Curse Of Her Flesh", and Ia am exited to do so, as I have big respect for this little cult flick, and I highly recommend any lover of Exploitation cinema to see it.
Seeing Annette again is a great experience, especially now that the disease MS has done so much to her physically, and yet she chose to do this to help make all aware of the devastation of this disease.
One fascinating sidebar was that the book we were reading in French was supposedly the untouched original; yet an English translation that one of my fellow students had contained the odd extra paragraph!
By that choice alone he was departing from Camus's intentions and yet, if you read the book today and see the film today, Mastroianni is Camus's Mersault.
Even as the film prattles on about mythic themes and makes references to famed art and literature, yet sells out to a lame technological gimmick, it still has potential.
We are led to believe she is naive to the ways of the world and yet knows to how to find and hire a private detective and gather enough information to 'gaslight' another person so cleverly.
And the up and coming ('scuse the pun) screenwriter is supposed to be a man-of-the-world and yet believes his dead lover speaks to him in a computer chat room?
You will note that she is the only one who's body is exposed and sexually available, yet it soon becomes clear that no one, least of all her husband, is interested.
Driven by a complex web of emotions that are at once well-drawn and yet never spelled out, Elaine invents a new screen name, "ArckAngel," and writes Robert, claiming to be his dead lover.
I felt for each of the character's, yet they are all so morally flawed that it is difficult to truly feel empathy for them, which keeps the movie on an emotionally distant, cerebral level.
The story is a bizarre triangle of interaction among three very bright, enlightened, yet passionately isolated people whose coming together is the stuff of tragedy on the grand scale.
If we from outside told them you have to rationalize your political system on the let's say German model, they would jump to the sky, and yet how can we accept that the political system is not the same in all the states, that citizens have to publicly declare themselves democrat or republican to be able to take part in the primaries, which goes against the very principle of democracy which is the secrecy of our political choices and our ballots.
Additionally, it's a mostly believable project from start to finish, accurately sampling many of China's social staples through concepts such as "guanxi" (connections) and "da ge" (basically a nickname for somebody more respected than oneself), yet doesn't make any claims of exotica, while steering clear of clichÃ©s (save for Yuelin living with her kindly old grandmother).
Certainly, some footage was covertly shot in Beijing itself, yet due to the government's disapproving attitude, production had to relocate back to the States.
i can't possibly say just how bad this film is, because a word has not been invented yet to do the job.
It doesn't have anything to say, yet also fails to say nothing in an intriguing or provocative way.
This film has such a delightful casualness and yet is strongly plotted and has superb performances and full of ideas and technique that is decades before Quentin T and co.  And anyone who can get me Claude Lelouch's email id or contact address....i'd be very grateful.
Angry spoilers ahead After what seems an eternity, finally this movie was apparently coming to an end, but the worst was yet to come: Lambert's wife, who is also imprisoned, is about to give birth to her child.
When seeing this film the first time, it makes me wonder why they don't allow prisoners to dream good things about intimacy, yet they allow assault by that 187 guy.
Title cards are kept to a minimum, and yet this is not a collection of technical tricks like Murnau's Der Letzte Mann.
This film is almost eighty years old, and in my opinion has yet to lose their strong plot history, with Douglas Fairbanks at his top performance and in his stunts.The stages are so impressive.I like this picture a lot more than the 1940 version,that was made with much more resources.
The movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects, toward the ending of the movie.
This was to be the least successful of Lucy's series but yet is not a big loss from the Lucy Show.
If you haven't voted yet, please do so at tvshowsondvd.com.
I really like how it started yet the ending can't be forgotten.
My super, smoking, sexy, hot boyfriend made two turkeys today we have yet to eat them....smells good, also mashed potatoes, stuffing with sausage, greens beans, nice rolls and butter and we didn't even need gravy in a can...homemade gravy.
And yet, this is his world, and - for all their problems - these people are his family; they're the ones who accept him and love him unconditionally and look out for him.
If you  haven't seen this movie yet, go out and rent it tonight, you won't be  disappointed.......
The L.A. segment portrays two very different women, for whom expectations from life differ completely and yet they are both content with who they are and they can somehow connect at some level.
The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern (see, for instance, Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf, where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem) that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead, yet again, into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of de-heroizing, de-mythologizing, and de-bunking the poem.
It is pacy and yet considered, the characters are well painted, both by the writing and the acting, and the story lines engrossing yet punchy.
If you like your films classy, well written, well acted, intelligent, thought provoking yet accessible, and with a great soundtrack (Tom Waits), then Night on Earth is for you!
This movie is not yet available on DVD in the USA, but I really hope it will be soon!
In the early 90's Jarmusch delivered this charmer, a movie that unites America and Europe through one single topic, yet shows very different versions of it.
Before Rome we visit Paris with the most mysterious, yet most catching segment, a curious story about the afore-mentioned blind woman and a black cab driver, who - we can't be sure - might be going blind himself (he's very short-sighted and therefore has problems with driving his taxi) and has a lot of questions to ask.
The woman, however, is not interested in conversation, yet we get the impression she opens up more than the driver realizes.
And yet the cabbie tops the story with one of the saddest things you'll ever have heard.
What's so great about this movie is that it tells such different stories with such different characters who all have different pasts and intentions, each accommodating the place of action (even visually - in L.A. even the buildings appear to be candy-flavored, while in Helsinki the city is cold, drab, yet hopeful) and it all comes together to this huge picture, which reminds us that we are all different but all live on the same planet and know similar things about life, death and everything in-between.
An interesting point is the actor who links these three films - charismatic Gerard Butler.He was fiery yet also sensitive as King Leonidas and the earlier Beowulf and made the roles his own.
In ANTHROPOPHAGOUS - ol' Joe is up to his old tricks - but this time, he saves his over-the-top elements til the end for maximum impact, and otherwise weaves a pretty atmospheric (yet admittedly slow-paced) horror film.
The story is drawn out slowly and the island sets and backdrops are simultaneously beautiful and yet still creepy and atmospheric at the same time.
What really makes this movie are the outrageous scenes - one in particular is very memorable - taking place near the end, which I dare not spoil for those yet to see this.
As for the lips - they're just not quite there yet - sometimes the speech didn't seem to be quite right.
It's not all the way there yet, but it's a damn good start.
(I hate to reference "Island of Death" yet again... but if you want to be shocked, the goat scene in that one easily outdoes anything shown here).
There can be no more visceral an image of a child born into the world of No Future than this, yet those who see it as mere unnecessary nastiness on D'Amato's part might reflect that it has a partial real life analogy in the treatment meted out to Sharon Tate's unborn child in the Manson gang murders as well as a rather more classical forebear in the famous Goya painting of Cronos devouring his child (in D'Amato's film, the father looks on as his child is eaten by the cannibal, but if the mirror analogy holds, he is looking at an image of himself).
Of course, I hadn't seen the uncut version of the film yet so I was just going off of the atmosphere.
Beowulf (the man) could have been written as a cookie-cutter hero, but fortunately he's something else - fallible and not yet the hero he must become later in the movie.
The plot is somewhat typical of a scifi movie, yet could've had potential: in the past, a crazy woman hijacked a ship carrying enough explosive chemicals to destroy a world.
If nothing else see it for the final scene, simple yet touching, and masterfully directed.
You aren't just told that Pascal's restaurant is tacky and subpar, yet flashy enough for the average diner to come in droves, you walk into it with a great point of view shot.
Its structure most resembles "Babette's Feast," where the dramatic climax of the film is a sumptuous yet exuberant banquet.
It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence, yet it makes such a lasting impression.
The focal point of the film is the chemistry between the characters of Stanley Tucci, playing a hard-working, pleading, frustrated restaurant owner, whose head carries only logic and a goal for success, and Tony Shalhoub, his brother, whose aggressive passion is for the food he cooks and the mystery and subtext within it, yet his interaction with people is painfully shy.
Their clashes of pride, their battles with each other's completely different perspectives, and yet their sharing of the same dream are what drives the story.
And a lesser movie wouldn't have had the scene between Isabella Rosellini and Minnie Driver which is quiet yet moving, like the rest of the movie.
Anyone who considers him/herself a lover of good food and doesn't drool over the "timpano" alone should check their pulse... And the performances are remarkably restrained, yet lively.
Truly interesting camerawork that draws one in, yet doesn't detract (or distract) from the story or the characters.
You made me think that the Turkish movie industry isn't over yet.
Half the fun of this movie is watching the younger supporting cast and identifying the future stars of Hawaii FiveO, Bewitched, The Nightstalker, and a few others I haven't figured out yet.
Really, the whole thing is just so far fetched, yet that is the film's great achievement because when you watch it, you actually believe it (at least I did!)
If you appreciate a prank on the grand scale then you have to see Forgotten Silver or, better yet, see it with an unsuspecting friend.  
Love is strange, yet we pursue it like the blind leading the blind, moving around in circles, no beginning, no end, and with an increasing sense of futility.
Also, this is supposed to be a musical revue, yet no one is asked to sing or do a scene.
A movie which combined venerable genres (the inside Broadway genre: 42nd Street, Lullaby of Broadway; the psychoanalytic dream sequence/vignette genre: Lady in the Dark, Oklahoma, Tales of Manhattan, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, etc; career vs family genres: The Red Shoes) with things yet to come (The Turning Point).
Mathieu is sleezy and exploitative... and yet he really does love, or thinks he loves, Conchita, and makes an exuberant fool out of himself doing so.
Mathieu's duplicitous nature is such that he is the token untrustworthy narrator, and yet it's quite clear throughout the movie that he's talking nothing but the absolute truth.
the quality is impossibly bad yet somehow some elements sort of stuck in my brain.
Mr. Film-buff says "Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he (Mathieu) doesn't really seem to notice this.
Clint Eastwood has tackled issues of all sorts, especially since he directed 'Unforgiven' and this is his grandest film yet.
How they only matter for something that has been deemed great, yet this "great" thing can be, very ironically, routine and even disregarded when it actually happened.
And the Battle of Iwo Jima had its historical significance given it's the first landing of Allied troops on Japanese soil, and one of the bloodiest yet with high casualties on both sides.
It's restrained, yet powerful, kept simple in instrument, yet never lacking in grandeur.
They felt that the heroes were those who had fallen on Iwo Jima - yet the public was continually holding them up to be more than they thought they were.
He has managed to create a film that makes no judgments, preserves the integrity of these people yet examines their life in war.
The music scored by Eastwood is heartfelt, non-intrusive yet elicits shades of heroism and hope.
This is his most violent movie yet.
I thought Romeo must die, Li's previous movie, was a poor scripted, poor acted, yet very entertaining movie.
The French bad guy, Richard, kills innocent civilians several times yet carries on as if nothing has happened.
I spent the whole time laughing at how utterly terrible it was, yet I enjoyed myself immensely.
Overall March and Grant have great on screen chemistry and interact well as two WWI pilots who dislike each other yet respect the others' abilities.
This inner turmoil continues throughout the film and climaxes when he is given yet another accolade.
Just when you thought it was safe to have a marriage, here comes yet another Lifetime "it's ok for women to cheat" yarn.
I think this is one of lifetime's greatest movies yet.
Hopefully it wont be for sometime yet.
As a UK citizen, I had never had the misfortune to see an episode of this 'talk show' as it was on digital and I haven't upgraded yet.
I was hoping against hope that perhaps Letterman's interview technique was second to none, but yet again I was disappointed: they are as vapid and un-illuminating as the rest of the show.
Thusday 18 May 2006 was the launch show for yet another series of Big BRother in the UK.
They spend nothing, yet YOU make them millions.
The word to describe this hasn't been invented yet in my opinion.
They couldn't care less about the welfare of the contestants, a point proved by the fact that this year we have had the worst bunch of idiots yet to grace our screens, including a former anorexic with pretty obvious self-esteem and mental issues.
Pleasantly set in and around a Los Angeles apartment complex, this isn't quite the pulpy thriller it was advertised as, yet it does work as an intriguing study of different people all teetering on the edge of morality.
And yet, it's a pretty good bit of entertainment, recommended to those who appreciate the genre as a whole rather than merely a short list of classics.
A film could be earnest and yet not very good, and perhaps with some unintentional entertainment value (like laughs).
It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.
Even the minor roles are covered well by perhaps lesser known yet veteran cast members such as Rosalind Cash and Matt Clark.
Jan Michel-Vincent is hardly convincing, yet watchable as heroic yet maligned scientist Shepherd, Julie Cassidy cuts a pretty figure and is fairly lively as his ex, working on a new project and Paul Koslo has a certain talent as her a-hole superior.
Regis Toomey was a prolific actor with hundreds of roles, and he was always dependable, yet he seldom was the star.
And yet the effect shines through: the movie has an eerie, otherworldly quality, where trivial details (such as an old lady glaring at a noisy conversation in a library) seem to take on ominous significance.
Sometimes it was sincere and well-grounded concern about the authenticity, but sometimes it seemed as if the Bulgakov die-hards behaved like modern Latunsky's by reproaching a movie they hadn't seen yet with sacrilege.
It is yet another mission to Mars film, but this time it is filmed as though it is live TV coverage of the final stages of the mission- with background interviews etc to fill the gaps.
Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave...sing it with me now!
Almost the entire film takes place in either Michigan or Chicago, and yet it was fully filmed in California.
Overlooked yet highly entertaining drama from director Francis Ford Coppola and producer George Lucas, an amusing and nostalgic look at real-life idea man Preston Tucker who, in 1945, developed the Car of Tomorrow and hoped to put Detroit's auto business out of commission.
For anybody reading this who hasn't yet seen the movie, I strongly suggest for you to save your money and stay away.
Each one is like watching a magic act and yet the entire clip runs seamlessly from end to end.
"Master and Margarita" is incredibly beautiful, deep, sophisticated yet playful and sparkling book with unforgettable characters.
Some of his techniques are truly brilliant, yet when you look closely, every bright child could have come up with the same ideas.
Better yet, Amazon currently is offering all three in the series (Gondry, Spike Jonze & Chris Cunningham) for $35 with free shipping.
The budget for this making is clearly very low yet the (only indoor) scenery is absolutely acceptable.
One cannot credit Derek Jacobi enough for his brilliant yet subtle performance throughout.
On a practical level, it's curious because, although it was completed in 2001, it has yet to achieve a wide release either at the cinemas or on DVD.
The film is different and has a good story and Van Damme has a different role here.The movie has Ted Levine as a good villain!Joss Ackland performed well.Also The film has special appearances by Thomas Rosales Jr. and Sven-Ole Thorsen!The music by Mark Isham was good and the music in the beginning sounded similar like his other work in Fire in the Sky.Like I said before this is not Van Damme all time greatest but its good and different.If you haven't seen it yet check it out!
Joseph Larraz, 70 years old now has a clear head yet and a great sense of humor.
Incidentally, this was yet another picture Â bafflingly M.I.A.
His youngest son, Allan, tries to help his father as he has not yet reached a point of maturity that allows him to see through his father behavior and understand it as manipulative.
The film reminds me of Schlondorff's The Tin Drum with its rather disturbing, yet comical theme of children growing up entirely too quickly, although The Art of Crying is, in my opinion, far more beautifully poignant as it is told through Allan's eyes.
It's a compelling tale, grippingly suspenseful as you wait to see what Henry and Allan will do next, yet disturbingly funny as you watch Allan delight in the most unpleasant things (just as long as they make Henry happy).
Leslie takes them on a tour of the would be crime scene, fills them in on the "motivation" for his soon to be killing spree, introduces them to his mentor, and even solicits their aid in setting up the events yet to unfold.
Watchable for the, yet kind of predictable, twist in the end,and the idea it starts on but that's it.
This is supposed to be a parody of the slasher genre, yet it shows no slashing.
How the doors slam shut at just the right moment, how the perfect weapons are always available to the killer while the victim can't seem to find anything to protect himself or herself, and how the killer manages to let all the other promiscuous teenagers in the vicinity know that there is a killer on the loose and yet still manage to pick them off one by one.
Slasher movies, at least you can say you got two movies that manage to be slasher and yet parody your hilarious clichÃ©s.
It's supposed to be for "channel 12" yet the "cameramen" are holding Cannon xg1 consumer cameras.
The pace is not nessecerrily slow and dreadful yet the links of 5 senses are too weak and trying too hard to be connected.
The painstaking animation of the supporting cast is 100% Fleischer comic whimsy, done this time to the most meticulous standards as yet undertaken by the Fleischers.
The film's main character is actually night watchman Gabby, who isn't very appealing (yet not too repellent to spawn a few further cartoons featuring his exploits).
They seem to have stopped releasing them for some unknown reason, yet you can get "He Man" on DVD; go figure :)
I have to say though that 10 years later as a manager and agent for musicians (not rock'n'roll and certainly not on the scale presented in the film) I had a whole new appreciation for people who possessed one undeniable talent yet made life hell for those who worked to help them make a living at it!
Killing herself before our eyes, yet we are helpless to stop her.
I have yet to see the Glass Menagerie performed live, and really have nothing much more to say now about the motion picture versions, except that further commentary may very well be forthcoming since my mind has been activated on the subject more than ever before thanks to websites like this.
Unlike Laura, he is more open in his disdain for his mother and her annoying ways...yet he eventually does what she wants AND is still at home though he looks to be in his 30s.
A story that gave flight to a thousand possibilities, yet to the unimaginative was maybe to Crebral for them to fathom maybe...
It has less sex than the series "Queer as Folk",or cable "Adult Movies", yet still communicates this aspect of gay relationships.
The simplicity yet cool storyline of the show is one of its greatest assets.
The plot steadily builds and the final five episodes are amazing: inevitable, yet soundly executed.
This is one of those shows that will age well given time - it feels like the actors/writers haven't quite settled into the show yet.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a disastrous first season with terrible, cheesy writing, low brow plot lines and terrible acting... yet it went on to have a huge cult following and seven seasons.
The bowling alley had people at every lane... yet only four eye-witnesses saw the robot?
6) Flash believes his father died in a fire, but he didn't, he was sucked through a portal to Mongo yet when we finally see a flashback of this "fire" it only occupies about 5% of their lab and is quickly extinguished with a fire extinguisher, its clearly not a big enough fire to cause major damage yet this is the cover story that Flash's father burned to a crisp and no body was ever found?
Anna van Hooft is brilliant as Ming's stuck-up teenage daughter, disgusted with her father's actions yet caring enough not to wish for his own death (or the death of others).
Medals he hangs on his fathers grave, medals which are still there 2 years later (it was the 3rd annual marathon he won in a row)... Dumb on 2 counts, obviously the leaving the medals and having them stay there for years is dumb but it shows that even 13 years after his father died, Flash has yet to move on.
But I enjoyed James Whitmore Jr and his by the book policing, Didi Mccall (Stephanie Kramer)stunningly beautiful yet so handy with her gun,although I must admit she looked too frail to be a real cop.All in all a good series to add to one's library.Cannot wait for future season releases to buy.
The plot is about 2 friends (Wilder and Pryor) who live in NY and are fired from their jobs on the same day so they agree to go to L.A to follow their dreams to became a playwright and an actor respectively but on their way to L.A they are sentenced to prison by mistake, but at prison they will have yet a couple of chances to be free again.....  Don't waste your time watching this terrible movie, If you do you will regret it.
I, in no way, can relate to the plight of the protagonist yet I understand the feeling of betrayal, therefore I was rooting for him all the way.
The movie while obviously low-budget (no different than we'll say "My Beautiful Laundrette" or "Mona Lisa" at this particular time in UK productions), yet its concentration on the inherent drama of a confused and conflicted ex-Para in a non-empathetic society totally over-rode its budgetary limitations.
And yet, there still hasn't been a DVD release of the cartoon, and reruns seem scarce.
For yet others, he is someone who will hurt them (which they expect), or who won't be hurt too much if they leave him.
I give it a 10 simply for its awfulness, and yet...sooooo hypnotic....
It's evidence of the naive yet self-centered people we were at the time.
'Jaws' wasn't even around to rip off yet, so what was the rationale for this uber-silly retribution-of-nature allegory?
The story naturally is silly and hardly ever scary, yet it's praiseworthy how director George McGowan attempts to build up an atmosphere of tension.
In spite of that, I gave this a 10 because I am so happy to find out there are a boatload of Poirot's that I have yet to see, and because I liked the chemistry between Elliot Cowan's character and Amanda Douge's character.
Based on yet another cleverly structured murder mystery from Agatha Christie, this dramatisation is absolutely crammed with webs within webs, lovely scenery, and many fine acting performances from a large, enormously star-studded, cast.
I was pretty stoked to see this film, generally 1950's films about giant beasts tended to hail from the US and this was one of the handful of British counterparts, along with superior classic The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Gorgo, which I've not yet seen.
The acting is also mostly a tad non-descript, Gene Evans and AndrÃ© Morell are slightly uninteresting heroes and the most engaging acting comes from a bizarrely enthusiastic yet wryly frozen faced turn from Jack McGowran as a paleontologist.
Also heard the print is clean & looks great sharper then the Laserdisc I actually didn't get mine yet so I can say by me.
BEHEMOTH is certainly one of the greatest depictions of monstrous evil yet realised for the cinema.
By the way, it's a crime that this perfect gem hasn't yet been let loose into the world on DVD so that the digital generation can marvel at its horror.
Evans plays his role straight and understated- he's the hero, yet doesn't let his character exceed what would be expected of a scientist investigating an unusual phenomenon.
This film's yet another example of wayyyyy under appreciated Warner's in house director, Lloyd Bacon.
I have yet to see him in a bad performance.
John Carpenter had yet to turn sour, and Kurt Russell was in his prime.
What you do get is absolutely true-to-form with the rest of the film: Snake walks away after successfully completing his mission (and saving his own skin) and yet can still screw the authority and the society that put him in the situation to begin with...and you find yourself grinning in approval.
And yet there is something lovable about them, something heroic.
He does adequately, yet watching this - Rhys' second cinema film - it becomes clear he's the star.
Already three years old, it has yet to be shown on British terrestrial television and nor do I expect it ever will be.
This is when you find your identification with the Boys, and the movie becomes yet even more wonderful.
It's great to see Niels Olsen in this type of role, not playing his usual wacky roles but instead a romantic lead - yet another surprise.
I haven't seen Little Nicky yet, so that may be his best.
After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet.
I haven't played the sequel "Baldur's Gate II - Shadows of Amn" yet, which is said to be even better, but Baldur's Gate is definitely one of the best RPGs of recent times.
I don't think that VCR's were even around yet.
This is yet another mass-market formula-flick from the (in)famous RGV factory.
I could easily look for "something wrong" about the movie, yet I choose to SEE otherwise.
If you have not guessed it yet the film producers have a religious type cult following.
All I can truly say from a purely intuitive viewpoint (and the nausea I felt when watching the movie) is that this is the most exploitive film I have ever seen produced, written and directed Â worse yet than Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" (perhaps as insidious).
The story line is very twisted and I'm surprised that it hasn't reached cult status yet.
The three stories in the film are connected in some way, and yet not completely connected.
A few middle age men are playing dominos and jokingly playfully yet also talking about their lives.
After this scene, the movie returns to the same beginning scene and yet focuses on other characters: the men around the table, Abel, Rutilio, and the bartender.
It would be unfair to compare both films, yet, one can see certain parallels in the way the films unfold.
Her daughter (Lisa McKinlay) is adorable yet completely natural.
He is dangerous to a fault, yet gentle.
She's also in director John Crowley's "Intermission" (2003, script by Mark O'Rowe) - taken on, among the stellar cast, the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally (the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright - then again, it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described) - another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.
She authentically expresses an irresistible yet forbidden attraction to Wilbur, while simultaneously displaying deep affection for Harbour, Wilbur's brother.
As the narrative becomes even more tangled, yet never contrived, we are drawn to the true heart of the film-Lone Scherfig's deft and loving examination of the characters' interactions.
His grave not even cold yet, Wilbur visits hand in hand with his brother's widow and stepdaughter talking of marriage (we all know how sacred those vows are to them.
Just the beginning alone is a testament to the violent brutality yet to come.
Wilbur, who is seemingly unreasonably yet persistently suicidal, cannot live with himself.
a good antidote to this weepy feely goody film might be Casanova, but i haven't seen it yet!
And yet he charms by his total indifference to what we think of him.
Cop refutes this by having an archetypal male hero - a cop - whose actions shape the movement of the film, and yet who is riveted to the screen, subjected to the merciless exposure of the camera.
I really enjoyed "The Birdcage" because it had a lot of serious issues, yet managed to turn into a fun joke.
The feel of the movie is really that of the 21th century, pushing the envelope with a vivid, in-your-face, yet artsy imagery.
This remarkably simple yet masterful piece and his previous short "Jettison Your Loved Ones" are reminiscent of Wes Anderson films but sport a style of their own.
If you haven't seen them yet, I'd recommend Googling for both of these shorts.
As linear progression without options is an abstraction of reality humans accept far too easily, this film did a splendid job of perverting the linear and can at least be viewed as a solid indication of the potential of newer technologies applied to film projects yet to come.
Claire introduces the boy as her sister: he is very clearly male (even while wearing a Communion dress), yet all the nuns and at least one priest automatically accept him as a girl.
He knows what is happening is so wrong but yet he can't seem to do anything about it.
It goes no way to explain why the main character Davey is aware from the start that something is seriously wrong, yet fails to do anything at all to help the girl as the level of abuse rapidly moves from overly-intimate tickling to violent, bloody, perverted, shocking rape, until the last few minutes of the film.
No other animal purposely imposes pain-most won't even kill their own species, yet we humans with our philosophies and religions find a way to be so pompous and arrogant to believe we are the master species of the planet.
It's a shame that the opportunity to bring this excruciatingly sad, yet important story about child abuse to the world via film was squandered so miserably.
Only the boy who lives next door, who has become friends with the girl, has a growing sense of unease about the "games" which are taking a very sinister turn, yet he is powerless to change the course of events.
By the time you find out that Ellen and Carla were the murders, you are thrilled that Jean smacks Ellen on the face, yet panged that Ellen and Carla led her on for so many years.
ahem, Terrance and Phillip... so basically, the 4 boys watch the Terrance and Phillip movie which is very rude yet hilarious, so after they watch it they become vulgar mouths and the south park parents are very angry and rages a war against Canada for making children become potty mouths.
At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?).
Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.
To those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, "less is more" (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen).
yet if you like it you can't help but admit that the movie is comedy genius.
Grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart.
Yes, the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes, but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world.
If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.
Muldaur made a career out of playing unlikable women, and yet I always admired her skill.
i just love this film, it's such a shame it isn't on DVD yet.
But it is John Doe who leaves the lasting impression - the uncredited actor (whose name I won't mention, in tradition with the movie) gives a monotonous yet completely spellbinding performance and you find yourself understanding and sympathizing with his motives far more than you'd want to admit.
However they're brought to life so well by the actors playing them that it doesn't make you shake your head in frustration over yet ANOTHER movie portraying stereotypes, but rather makes you shake your head in laughter over the deadpan things they say and do, which are so obviously unreal at times that anyone who thinks this movie will promote a false picture of the gay community needs a reality check.
The script is fantastic, the murders are bizarre yet ingenious.
He still had the anime look with big eyes yet the other characters looked like generic cgi characters.
Simplistic to be family-friendly, yet it has some plot and characterization elements that appeal to adults as well.
It ends up as a movie that is both young at heart yet mature in content.
I am not going to repeat the plot yet again.
It is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us, yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film's reality (e.g.
The animation is beautiful, yet not like any animation you've seen.
Flatland itself is appropriately extremely two-dimensional, yet has endearing qualities.
A moving, honest, brave yet depressing masterpiece!
It would be great to make a true biographical movie or better yet mini-series about composer's life.
Basic, zany, Spielberg produced Freakazoid was just one of those shows you watched in hilarity, compete and utter rubbish and yet you loved it.
We are in her shoes yet the reason WHY she is this way isn't shoved down our throats.....it's a gradual discovery.
It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.
After searching around the internet she comes to a site which for some god knows reason is obviously a fetish sex site but yet she decided to hire the creator of the web site to try to exorcise her ghosts or some fool thing.
Combine that with Fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter Â `Se7en' features a scene with Somerset and Mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense Â and `Se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from.
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.
Willie is a decent man who hasn't yet learned to get off his ass and work, while Fernando, who tries to pass for Italian is a straight up prick.
The audience is, of course, happy that Hazel Flagg is alive and well in Tahiti, and yet underneath it all they feel a little CHEATED.
I knew it'd be memorable, since I've yet to meet a Ben Hect script I didn't love, I am very fond of Carole Lombard and Frederic March is one of the most under-appreciated actors of all time.
The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching.
Although this does not yet reach the greatness of Cronenberg movies such as "Scanners", "The Dead Zone" or "The Fly", "Shivers" is definitely an atmospheric and creepy film that delivers gore, shocks and sleaze and, in spite of resemblances to films like "Night Of The Living Dead", quite some originality.
Moreover, this picture comes through with several effectively nasty moments: the jolting opening with a deranged old scientist murdering his teenage mistress, cutting opening her abdomen, and pouring acid in her stomach prior to slitting his own throat; Betts being violated by a parasite while taking a bath, a parasite attacking Linsky by attaching itself to his face, and a brief, yet startling shot of two little kids on leashes walking on all fours and barking like dogs.
This "Shivers", released back in 1975, is yet another entirely different chapter in the Cronenberg success tale...
Good job by Lloyd Bridges, who had not yet made it big.
The film also features tragic sex bomb Barbara Payton in her first major role and she also scores as a somewhat naive, yet ruthless, partner to Bridges.
Better yet, buy it!
And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.
The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.
The Asylum strikes again with yet another terrible film, this time a zombie movie.
These zombies, supposed to be ghosts of those cursed by Bill after he returned from the Civil War broken and defeated, finding that they had murdered his sister, only to be executed by the township, using the notorious killer's own sword, are yet another retread of the George Romero brand where they rip away flesh and drop when shot in the head.
The Asylum has released yet another winner, and by winner I mean a piece of crap that should have never seen the light of day unless it were featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3,000.
I've waded through lots of zombie movies trying to find some good ones.And since Romero has only made 5 there aren't very many good ones among the loads of stinkers out there.This one was one of the worst pieces of homemade garbage I've seen yet in my quest to find good zombie movies.
Speaking of which, it was in the legend that Bloody Bill hated blacks yet he didn't kill the black characters any differently from the whites, so they blew that plot twist completely.
Gwen sensed something was wrong with the "Eric" in cowboy attire coming towards them, yet she continued to simply stand there, why?
Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it.
There are a lot of things that could have been done - simple things - to make it a much better movie: i.e, why is it one of the students trapped in the town knows the whole legend about Bloody Bill and yet none of the others, his friends, have even heard of it at all?
They are very similar in background (both were veterans of the war, both had their satchels stolen), yet ended up on opposite sides of the law.
The film can be gritty, yet sentimental.
There are in NORA INU things, intuitions, images, bits that I, Cristian Ciopron, did not find yet in the American cinema; Kurosawa was, we all know it already, deft with the genre flicks, and NORA INU is an exemplar action dramaÂwith what perspicacity and brio and shocking vehemence!
With his penchant for incorporating "Western" ideas into his films, Kurosawa hits yet another home run with his take on the crime film.
And yet again we have the brilliant Shimura playing off of Mifune, speaking in carefully modulated tones as he dispenses advice to the hotheaded young detective.
And yet, he was also a likely a man with his share of flaws, and a good chunk of the film is about the relationship between him and Honey, his girlfriend-turned-wife.
Amores Perros is a must see for those of you who haven't seen it yet, and Powder Keg is no exception either.
Really, could be the director's decision, I never saw Babel, yet, so I don't know if it's just his style.
This film is of the type that is supposed to be a horror and yet it makes you laugh and cringe at how bad it is.
And this film is the undisputed king of "tacky horror" - a genre that is supposed to be horror and yet turns out to be a comedy.
and maybe the fact that it follows the plot to 'scream' so predictably, yet attempts to come off seriously, was what really got under my skin.
This is a compelling, mesmerizing, heartbreaking yet inspiring epic which towers above all other depictions of World War Two and the Holocaust.
In fact, I plan to revisit this monumental, tour-de-force, this unbelievably touching, yet oddly uneven masterwork more than once.
Because it was an epic miniseries, which cost around $110 million to make, the television powers that be were able to film at various locations around the world and bring vastly different (yet interconnected) stories of the war to the small screen.
Just when it seems that cinema has descended yet again into the deep abyss of zero plot combined with tons of special effects performed by pretty boys and pop tarts with no acting abilities whatsoever to disguise the fact that it is trash, something new comes along to uplift the entire sorry state of modern film and restore the discerning audience's faith in the true art of the cinema.
Paul McGann portrays the simmering angry, repressed, frustrated breadwinner who hates change yet despises his limited, impoverished, meaningless existence of doing carpet installation day jobs.
Helen Hunt is great as the cruel, stressful yet sensitive waitress.
There are so many memorable scenes, its full of drama yet is a great comedy.
Lets face it Jack Nicholson was made for the part, and he says things that I would love to do but never have the balls, yet he is incredibly dry.
the story is simple, and yet so complex.
the characters are out-of-the-world and yet so real.
And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so much.
He doesn't play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on "Will and Grace" who acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick).
The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner.
The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others.
Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas?
This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age.
Yes - it's an action film, a dramatic film, a fantasy, a somewhat-dark (yet hopeful) fairy-tale.
Barney uses his newfound abilities to create all kinds of comically wild havoc which includes helping his hip, wealthy best friend Payton (a winningly breezy turn by Willie Aames) hook up with snarky, yet desirable cheerleader Jane Mitchell (a delightfully bitchy portrayal by Heather Thomas).
My advice for anyone who has yet to watch it?
The actors aren't familiar to me except Qi shu which portrayed the role in a hardcore tough yet so fine and sexy way.
I believe that there is a cult of film making and watching that "like the Emperors new clothes" permeates the industry where begin,middle and end are inconsequential and there more avant Gard they appear the more they are accepted.Techniques are fine but they must be employed within the frame work of a genuine story told in believable format with the enjoyment or compulsion of the watcher paramount.It is fine line between puerile rubbish and this type of film but an attempt to relate to the masters of previous successful productions would lead to far more success than this banal attempt to be modernistic and yet void of real incident.
Audiard captures the character's nervous intensity and brings the macho sub-culture of Paris to life, yet the film lacks any semblance of warmth.
Its script is absolutely wonderful, showing the protagonist having a dark and ugly side, yet possessing the ability to express his sensitivity, as a classical pianist, through music, as he prepares for an audition with an agent.
It is a violent film, yet a humorous one at the same time, with great acting.
De battre mon coeur is a remake of Fingers, which unfortunately I have not seen (yet).
I just keep wondering why there isn't a love interest yet for the President since he did say in the first movie that he is a widower.
But overall, it was a great movie, that unfortunately hasn't come to DVD yet, so I hope since "First Shot" has, this one will finally make it.
Incidentally, yet another contemporaneous Western pitting one woman among several desperate men in a remote landscape was THE NAKED SPUR (1953), one of the well-regarded series of Anthony Mann/James Stewart Westerns â as in that film, the central group here has to contend also with a horde of marauding Indians.
The two stars work well off each other: Cooper is laconic but experienced and essentially honest, while Widmark is cynical and opportunistic yet effortlessly charming; interestingly, Cooper was often paired with younger but equally tough men around this time â such as Anthony Quinn in BLOWING WILD (1953), Widmark here, Burt Lancaster in VERA CRUZ (1954) and Charlton Heston in THE WRECK OF THE MARY DEARE (1959).
The supporting cast, then, includes only one prominent role for a Mexican â yet another member of the group who, in defiance of the Indian onslaught, expires in a hail of arrows â whereas young Rita Morenoâs saloon singer proves to be the only other female character in the film.
Each character offers some sense of presence to the film; Cooper is able to portray the silent, strength of character person, while Widmark adds a philosophical, yet cynical, view of life in his role as Fiske, a gambler.
'Penny Serenade' also touchingly deals with the subject of adoption in an honest yet sympathetic manner.
Dunne wrote to the kind adoption lady telling her their tragedy as soon as the girl died, and before Dunne has a chance to leave Grant for good, the adoption lady informs the couple (who have yet to make up and are just as miserable as ever - remember it has only been three days since their little girl died) that the agency just got in a sweet little boy (two years old, golden curls, the sort of kid they thought they wanted to adopt before they saw their baby girl), and would they be interested in seeing him?
This is a heart tugging yet not sappy story of a couple who realize they need a child to keep them together and their only option is adoption.
There are many familiar yet well executed themes: adopted children can be just as loved as birth children; you don't have to have lots of money to be a good parent.
The central conflict is that the main character's best friend wants to leave town as soon as possible, and the main character doesn't quite yet.
If only the filmmakers had implied that several *months*, or better yet, a year or more, had passed, and shown the couple finding each other again first, it would have been much more believable and touching.
One thing I have yet to find: a good print of this movie.
Although it is a bit lengthy, the movie is a delightful, yet sad, story about breaking away from the family and finding one's own path.
And why "Mars, Bringer of War" by Holst in yet another film?
Gordo Cooper even comments that he gets on the cover of magazines, gets a free car, free lunches all across America, a free home with all the furnishings and loads of money and "I ain't even been up there yet".
Visually, this film is extremely well realized, though the VHS release gives somewhat less evidence of that (it's yet to be put out on DVD).
There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it.
It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.
As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success.
It doesn't take a genious to figure out that things get really depressing, yet I won't spoil the ending..  All I have left to say is that you have to see this movie..
The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).
And yet the actress looked 28.
Kristin is described as being incredibly beautiful; and yet, the actress was, if not directly ugly, certainly not pretty or attractive in any way.
And yet I saw few such characteristics in the way the actress portrayed her.
In contrast, the actress who played Erlend's former love interest Eline was a very beautiful actress closer in age to Erlend, and she had very little screen time, yet the actress who played Kristen was very, very plain and in virtually every scene.
The movie perfectly captures the genius of the novel(s), the external and internal drama of a young woman's struggle with pride and sin, her rebellion against the good and yet her longing for it.
The plot kicks off with the narrator explaining that Belgrade cannot yet claim to be a world metropolis.
If you are at that youthful 'turning point' time in your life, you will definitely relate and if you aren't at that place yet, you will learn about the turning points of decision that are soon to be headed your way.
SECRET OF THE BLUE ROOM benefits from attractive sets (leftover from THE OLD DARK HOUSE and FRANKENSTEIN) that convey an ornate yet forbidding castle milieu.
The series is short, merely 26 episodes, and the story telling is minimalist also (truly post-modern) yet each episode is complete.
The individual episodes work well on their own for the most part, yet as pieces of the whole they complement each other very well.
Broke bounty hunters, barely able to find enough money to eat yet unable to be anything but compassionate stoke this sympathy even farther.
Her renditions of "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill," with th help of Annette Warren's dubbed-in vocals, manage to be sultry and yet very tender, too.
Before I continue, anybody who wants to watch this Movie, has not yet seen it, DO NOT pay attention to the bad comments.
This film is different it is obvious that not that much money has been spent on it, yet it still manages to truly scare(for many days).
He had an off-wit charm yet caring demeanor that I could see different types of women falling for.
Out of all the B-movies I have watched lately, this one must have been the most predictable yet inconsistent, irrational, inaccurate and downright plain dumb, making it purely an insult to the viewer's intelligence.
Why isn't Gary Daniels a big star yet?
The scenes of the gangster and the conflicted scientist constantly standing in front of the screens is at once deliberately "boring" and yet so weirdly disturbing.
Golden wavy-haired, stalwart, fine-figured, supremely handsome, serious yet light-hearted, flirting with his wife yet always ready at a moment's notice to follow up any lead as a police doctor.
There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time.
There are images in this film you will never see anywhere else...of birth, of work, and of death...all presented bluntly, yet with exquisite artistry .
Only a person that is thoughtful enough can do such thing with such grace and yet be so aggressive about it.
Plus, he is also brilliant in criticizing some past tragic events in a humorous yet effective way.
Those events would not affect anyone's life negatively, and yet, it would not have been our first thought.
Luis Bunuel gives us a series of connected yet individual little movies in one that asks questions like "why not?"
In what is sure to be one of the most intriguing yet bizarre pictures to come about since the work of Fellini, Luis Bunuel directs this dramedy picture about the random incidents and moments that come about in the thought of the mind, yet somehow reflect on the hypocrisies of society and man.
Shot in a similar fashion as many of the Monty Python pictures, Bunuel's film is definitely more subtle, yet adventurous and hilarious at all means.
He would put things together, twist them, run them through a wash machine and come out with elements that one might think would never work together, yet they make perfect sense.
he comes up with the most twisted ideas and yet if you think about it isn't so twisted it makes perfect sense.
BuÃ±uel still has yet not to surprise me.
And yet, everything is done with a lot of fun.
What person would order these exercises and then open the window and let all their many, many papers blow across the office and yet continue exercising?!
'The Spoilers' may be the most often-filmed western, ever, yet it has been largely forgotten by today's moviegoers, which is a shame!
Novarro looked more convincing as a student than some of the other players, and yet was thirty-three at the time.
He was studious, promiscuous, proud, humble, a "dirty" fighter, and yet devoted to "weak" friends as well.
There were times when their treatment of Novarro was revolting, but yet they seemed good fellows at the end--how true in life.
Overall, the movie is satisfying, more routine than I expected, and yet a worthy entry in that fascinating sub-genre, the Gold Rush Western.
But I saw him in this film and a film, that has yet to be released in the U.S. called "Chaos."
In fact, better yet if they hadn't filmed it at all.
the story line is so full of holes, and pointless narrative its a waste of time me even writing about it, as a snipes fan I watched this, and recently with the likes of Zig Zag, Undisputed and then Unstoppable coming from Wesley I was hoping for an upturn in quality, but yet again he failed me with this film, so poor I can't believe I wrote this much about it !
Matt McCoy stars as Scott,a Navy Seal who is the target of wrath of Shannon (Glenn Plummer) who thinks Scott sold him out, he didn't but that doesn't stop Shannon from abducting Scott's wife, or blowing up various figures in the pentagon, once again absurd plot twists come up and the flick rips off many action sequences to give it a more explosive look in this terrible yet funny movie.
In fact, the plot is yet another rehash of Japanese master Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic YOJIMBO (1961), which had actually led to Sergio Leone kick-starting the Spaghetti Western subgenre with that film's first remake A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964)!
Well Miike asks the question and answers it with "Sukiyaki Western Django" a gleeful homage that lovingly references and even satirizes the hugely popular westerns so firmly rooted in the pulp and legends of the American West, and yet ironically shaped so decisively by the perspectives of men like Kurosawa and Leone.
--While the spoilers in this review concern the plot, they will not ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it yet.
Fashion model turned actor Iseya Yusuke (Casshern, Memories of Matsuko) turns in another fantastic performance as the vicious yet wickedly handsome "Minamoto No Yoshitsune", a man who fancies himself as the embodiment of the Japanese "Samurai spirit".
Like trendy Asian "fusion" cuisine, "Sukiyaki" takes the best of both worlds and offers up something new yet oddly familiar.
That's to say the dialogue itself is a pastiche of noticeable one-liner clichÃ©s, over the top silly yet listening to entire dialogues stitched together from over used lines has a remarkably refreshing effect on those lines.
I actually haven't seen this a thousand times, yet it feels like I have.
Nudity and gore feature prominently (especially considering the time of release), yet it's all rather dull.
This moody British horror film was made several years before the "stalk 'n' slash" genre kicked off, yet this atmospheric chiller possesses a number of elements that would later become popular in the modern horror genre.
Very sadly one of the funniest and most active comedians I have ever seen Bill Owen died recently, but although he was almost the main character in the show I'm certainly glad that for Bills memory that the show has continued.One of the great things about the show is that just about all of the actors in the show have made their mark in other comedy's and other shows, yet they all seem like they have been in the show from the start, for example Jean Alexander spent many years as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street and Stephen Lewis was well known as Blakey in On The Buses.
I think that those who haven't "gotten" Bunuel yet might want to see this one.
That's Laura's dilemma, and Albou treats it with dignity yet without sententiousness.
its not like Ur old style Indian movie where the British were shown equal to a devil like ruler, but the understanding was there why the villagers didn't like their presence their yet some liked them because of their work - the frictions between members from both sides who are able to accept the other side is also well shown
The narration by Joanne Woodward is jarring at first, yet gives the modern viewer an idea of 1870's New York City mores.
Mr. Scorcese does masterful camera work and evokes loving performances from all the performers, and yet I felt something staid and almost too respectful.
This is yet another example.Scorsese surpasses his material to make a beautiful, bravura nmasterpiece.
Even the normally atrocious Winona Ryder excelled in a role that was simply a tour-de-force for her...the vapid but yet not so vapid after all May Welland.
Scorsese is always acute in his casting decisions, and this is one of the films many virtues:  Lewis is perfect as a man who's struggle between his passion & his duty are constantly on the verge of devouring him (yet somehow he thrives on his torture).
The Martin and Lewis shtick gets stood on it's ear by Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, a couple of characters I've never heard of, yet they appear here using their own names.
No one has made as many bad films yet their name is immortal.
This one is no different on that front, except this time; instead of merely focusing on a bunch of worms, or yet another troupe of deformed, deranged backwoods killers; Lieberman has the advantage of an intriguing mystery to base his film on.
"Blue Sunshine" is more fondly remembered for it's bald,thirty-something,ex-hippie murderers who are easily the most bizarre descendants of the living dead yet to reach the silver screen.This film is not easy to categorize:it's a horror film mixed with drug movie and also features paranoid urban legends and bizarre conspiracy theories.The title of this movie is taken from the name of a bad batch of 60s acid that seems to have some rather unfortunate long-term side effects.The film is badly lit and there are some dull spots,but "Blue Sunshine" is a must-see for experimental cinema enthusiasts.7 out of 10.
But this film integrates a variety of story lines and looks to take the viewer on a forward and backward ride forcing you to think about what you missed and what is yet to come.
This movie is the remake of yet another Hollywood one "While You Were Sleeping".
Many of the young cast would go on to solid careers, yet few of them would ever give greater performances than they do here.
This must be the last of the quality BBC dramas yet to be released on DVD.
Some of life's more offensive moments were shown for what they were and yet simultaneously rendered hilarious when role-reversed: the executive women's nearly unconscious treatment of waiters at the local bar, for example.
How I wish I could remember the rest, or better yet see it in repeats.
Watching this show is like watching a very nasty train wreck - you want to look away yet you can't help but stare at the horror...
The only people who could possibly like this show are the hopeless pre-teens who have nothing better to with with their time and don't really know the meaning of quality yet (we're all victims at that age; I remember Saved by the Bell all too well).
It's not often in a film that one sees a priest killed - and with a cross yet.
All the jokes are predictable and stale, and the subject itself is somewhat offensive since it seems to (yet again, as in "Taxi" or "Hitch") justify racially-tinged humor at white guys without taking the same swipes at the other races dishing it out.
Bernie Mac and Judith Scott appeared to be a bit too young to be the parents of girls in their mid-20's, yet the premise is all too real in the USA and in the Caribbean...
Many black families have a problem with racial jokes yet object to their children being "colour-blind," and marrying outside The Race, but this is a problem swiftly solved by both intendeds letting everyone in their respective families know that they're marrying each other and not the family!
Ashton Kutcher works well with what he is given, yet his character comes across as a trite, clumsy bumpkin to Mac's ferocious flare, and is merely the butt of every comedic catastrophe, rather than a multi-dimensional character who can hold a candle to thwarting his own preordained chagrin.
The laughing stock might not be constant throughout the film, yet there is just enough humor to enjoy and laugh yourself silly.
The reality: I have watched many movies based on the Jewish Community that I come from, and yet there are always things (sometimes even only one thing) that could never have taken place.. something quiet not kosher.
It was a story of the Journey.. the hardship we face.. the reality that we have so few choices... the pain we take in becoming healthy individuals in a society that is so foreign from us, yet within miles of our life.
Having just watched Crash, it is interesting to contrast the clichÃ©d approach to racial tension in that film to the delicate yet ultimately more powerful way this film deals with the same theme.
Mr. Caetano plays with our emotions in the way he presents a good man who is willing to work, yet, circumstances beyond his control make him the butt of the hatred people feel about the poor immigrant who is only doing a minimal job to survive.
The dialogue could have been more elaborate - that would certainly have upped the quality and believability quotient - not that the film strays too far from reality - in fact it tends to steer back on track and find it's way safely to the end, yet scenes such as the one when Jason Ritter is in the bar by himself with only a few "workers" around him and the things the barman spouts there.
One can't help but think this could have been so immensely better with a different director, yet it is still surprising that it was carried under his wing.
Actually it's the luckless driver who ends up terminated, with a slug in the belly from ungrateful, wacko passenger Gunther Wykoff (Thompson) who has not yet learned how to blink or turn his head.
What I liked about "Dial 1119" is that it's basically ignored as an example of film noir yet, for a film made in 1950, this thing was ahead of its time.
I had low expectations for this film, and yet, it was somehow worse than I had expected.
I felt corrupted by the soul-crushing message behind the movie, yet I wasn't even able to get my rocks off.
Funny the chicks name is Alaine Cunny and yet there really isn't any of that.
In summary, she doesn't give you the impression that she is doing yet another boring porno- flick, where she is forced to do "some acting", in order for the movie to HAVE a plot, other than gynecological nudity scenes, or 3-minute "sex-adventures".
Emmanuelle can also be seen as a spiritual road movie, where she starts off as an innocent, yet strongly sensual girl, who slowly reaches sexual awareness and competence.
To top it off, the whole endeavor was based on a scandalous best-selling novel, allegedly penned by the wife of the French Ambassador in Bangkok, yet frequently assumed having been the handiwork of the good Government official himself.
With its glossy sheen, EMMANUELLE can't help seeming a lot more hypocritical than its many imitators, and yet I still like the movie an awful lot.
This is the finest example of soft core movie-making I have watched yet, with a great title song and melodious instrumental accompaniment that gives it all a sensuous and alluring ambiance, very effective slightly hazy photography that makes the bodies even more desirable, and a sweet/ingÃ©nue character in the superb shape of angelic-looking Sylvia Kristel who gives you an erection in no time.
Not having read the particular book it was based on yet it certainly ties in the imagery and methodologies used in other novels of his I have read.
She treats him like s h i t, her "friends" treat him like s h i t, yet - for reasons known only to screenwriter, director and pretentious tw*t extraordinaire Christophe Honore - he still hangs out with them all.
The film is about Rahul (Khan), an ambitious guy works as an assistant of manipulative, married yet womanising businessman Siddharth (Pancholi).
Juhi Chawla's Seema is an aspiring model, yet she comes across as a very simple and gentle young woman who has great values and who, like Rahul, has dreams of finding success.
The story shows, satirically yet substantially, how often we tend to lose ourselves when we try to make our dreams come true.
It's sometimes almost revolting, and yet when you've seen the story-lines that led to these scenes, you may find the actions acceptable (or maybe I've a twisted mind).
Watch it on a Sunday afternoon for Hackman, and perhaps Lela Rochon (as yet another useless character) as eye candy.
Just an example, Sam's daughter Lee(Faye Dunaway) never visits her father before he dies in the book, but yet in the movie they have her visiting him.
I've not had much luck catching up on the John Ford films I haven't seen this year, and The Fugitive is yet another in this year's run of terrible disappointments.
When Statham is stripped of his predictable (yet consistent) charisma, someone has messed up something awful.
I also thought that some of the transitions were simple, yet stunning.
Far Side of the Moon is entertaining and highly imaginative and I would recommend it, yet there is little emotion in the film and, for all its transcendental motifs, I found it to be lacking a sense of the mystery and wonder of either outer or inner space.
I give kudos to Marc Singer for delivering a modest, yet impressive performance.
The best is yet to come, I'm sure ...  
For those of you into Yakuza films yet wonder what many mobsters may face from early in life this film is an ideal acquisition to discover a master in his pre film rich era of the 70's.
This movie fits right in; yet still stands out because of the originality, at least in the west, of its story.
It's very strange that Liam Neeson hasn't yet won an Oscar.
I haven't seen Kinsey yet.
Despite the occasionally banal dialog and petty squabbles, this is obviously a family with whom love is deep yet unspoken, and emotions that are universal.
The narrative of the film seems hesitant, delicate, unsure in its motion, but yet it has a very natural appeal and is definitely rich in meaning, and beautifully layered.
The director avoids all sentimentality, yet the movie has moments of humor, pathos, cynicism, charity and quiet desperation.
There are suspenseful moments and one wonders what would happen next - outcome could be predictable yet its share of drama and humanity lessen not.
By the end, for me, it felt dis-satisfyingly schematic, and yet there are images that will haunt you for years, and a feeling that Angelopoulos has found a way to distill the fraught years of European history from the First World War to the Cold War into an extraordinary cinematic vision.
I am looking forward to watching remaining two films though they have not been finished yet.
Not full of belly laughs, but quite a few "I wish I could say that in real life", or better yet, "I wish I could think of things like that in real life to say to my friends, and even to strangers".
It's a triangle whose hypotenuse and legs we all know well, yet Stillman imbues it with a freshness through deft wordplay and real feeling for his characters.
The kids have not yet lived enough to be fully forming the opinions they insist upon shoving down each others throats, and the comedy comes from their own inexperience and total lack of thinking other wise.
The dialogue is a never-ending delight, full of great one-liners, yes, but also some equally cherishable, marvellously pompous sermonising and theorising from these slightly preposterous yet strangely loveable people (particularly Charlie Black).
I roared with laughter, and yet I felt her character's yearning - both for the love of her life and for the elusive acting opportunity.
Lillie has a physical presence that is mesmerizing; her face is not traditionally beautiful, or even traditionally feminine (an aspect which is exploited in the story)--yet she is all the more striking as a result.
For Violet toils away behind-the-scenes, both in her job and in her intervention on others' behalf, yet never receives the credit or rewards she deserves.
OF COURSE most viewers will track this one down for the first screen appearance of stage comedienne nonpareil, Bea Lillie, and Lady Peel gives an absolutely beautiful performance (pretty enough to win an English Lord, as the actress did in real life, yet able to walk a perfect comedic tight rope between insouciant self-confidence and nagging insecurity), but there is even more to recommend this charming backstage comedy than the star performance.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
Featuring Dirk Bogarde, Britain's prettiest closet gay, as yet another handsome heterosexual; he gives his usual competent turn as a cryptologist-par-excellence who is so obsessed with his craft that he can't even concentrate on sexy Susannah York (though we all know the real reason).
Kay had not yet developed the sophisticated, edgy style she was so famous for later in her career.
Focusing on stellar oceanographer and renowned documentarian Steve Zissou and his corky yet profound team, The Life Aquatic leaves the audience literally speechless as the credits roll.
Parallels can easily be drawn, but yet in so many ways it outshines them all.
Its humorous yet grabbing dialogue are almost Tarantino-esquire.
Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet).
It is fun to see how Boyle includes them in is most commercial movie yet(and hopefully, ever).
These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions.
Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.
or better yet Criminal Minds.
It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation   Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart .
If you have not done so yet, find a friend who has the DVD's or rent them, and start catching up on, and enjoying "24", the best show on television.
Jack Bauer is a fantastic character...friendly, kind hearted, yet certainly not a guy to mess with.
I think upon all the episodes i watched it seams it talk about American history and all the suffering that America is facing from their enemies were caused by their great white leaders i think a black head of state can resolve this issues.And also i think if there such movies yet going to be released in the future all the main supporting characters should survived at least seven seasons before they are ripped off.Even though 24 is a very nice movie and it tells a lot about what America is capable i think America is boasting its self to the world that no one can touch them and it can also attract more enemies around the world by also tempting them in so many ways.
And yet the film is, under this surface, recognisably Wellesian - the old man who has amassed great wealth at the expense of an emotional life, who seeks to control others; the use of storytelling as a metaphor; the idea of the author as a repressive God, who makes his characters conform to his will; the subsequent destruction of the author who uses his power to repress, not express, or create, who does not realise that making a story 'real', in the fatuous hope for immortality, can only mean that the author becomes superfluous; the loyal assistant/friend whose life has been emotionally deadened by the need to serve (and suppress moral qualms about) the great man; the tone of the film, nocturnal, quiet, still, cicadas resounding, suffused with sterility and death.
And yet, there is an otherworldly quality to the central bedroom sequence, aided by Jeanne Moreau's astonishing performance, that raises the film into the realm of the magical.
This is why the ending is gory yet touching at the same time.
), a crazy local, asks a cryptic question: 'Have ya met Toby yet?'
Again, it pains me to say all this but save your dimes kiddies and buy some pop-rocks, or better yet, an old MiniDV camera and make your own films.
Her sweet, vulnerable, yet strong and assertive personality shines as does her comedic ability.
It was the best adventure game yet I've ever played.
Until now, I've only saw the second biggest monkey head yet.
And yet, women still did not have the right to vote.
I know I viewed it at a particularly poignant time in my life, as a young, hopeful female student in our nation's capital, but I feel confident that this story can affect any and all people fighting (or hoping) for rights, freedoms, or dreams they've yet to achieve.
Strange as it is, my friend and I realized these women were some of the most important and influential people in American political/civil rights history, and yet I would bet that very few people alive today can even name them, let alone talk about how they went on hunger strike while in prison and gave up comfortable lives for a cause greater than themselves.
I knew when I saw the woman's naked back scrawled with Votes For Women in what appeared to be red lipstick that this would be yet another stinker from HBO.
Cate Blanchett's character is beautiful, pregnant, fiercely independent, and yet vulnerable.
It's still ludicrous at times and yet the viewer welcomes it and enjoys it.
I totally enjoyed this movie for its ability to be educational and moving and yet integrate light-hearted vignettes.
And yet, the basic plot outline of this film isn't *that* original or revolutionary.
"The Man Without Memory" / "Puzzle") of 1974 is not (yet) a very well-known Giallo, but it sure is a great film worthy of more attention.
Plus, a glitch about the game, is that she flies in cut scenes, yet she can only glide when you play as her.
One of my personal faves from the early 80`s.This insane tale of teen rebellion and television abuse features an intensely wild and animated performance from Robin Johnson as the juvenile delinquent come rock star Nicky Marauda,and some wickedly understated(for a change)camp from Tim Curry as the enigmatic yet highly opportunistic D.J.Features some great new wave music from XTC,The Ramones,Gary Numan and others set against the backdrop of NYC`s seedier side.Great fun.
Murray gives an amazing, energetic, yet deadpan performance and I also liked the richness of the smaller roles like "Klaus."
And yet it also swirled with a crackling, decadent energy.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" ) was determined to release yet another of his musical exploitation films designed to make a lot of money on the soundtrack.
If you want to see a movie that deals with the same content (witchcraft) yet has a much better story line, see "The Craft."
Once Bob feels needed and perhaps 'loved' by Vanessa he begins to change, only to have unfortunate reminders of reality enter and alter his life yet again.
We aren't really asked to look to deeply at these two pivotal characters in the film, yet they act as a prism regarding the various themes and characters in the film; arguably helping to blend and mix them so we can more easily identify with the film itself.
The presentation is often cartoonish and stereotypical, yet the emotion that was conveyed are often bloody raw to a fault that you just can't simply escape.
Power always remained easy on the eye, even if by the mid 40's he looked like a man-boy that resented his own prettiness and yet unable to face the on-coming middle age.
They are like the grandmothers we'd love to have---filled with both love and discipline, yet bubbling with an earthiness that makes us want to see them a bit under the influence to reveal what they are really like.
It is just so captivating, it has a wonderful soundtrack that matches the movie perfectly, and the ending is so sad, yet so imaginative.
In my opinion, the best movie of the "dark humor" genre to be exhaled from someone's mind yet.
Bob Maconel (the hilariously disguised Christian Slater), a despondent office worker, decides that he is going to perform a murderous rampage at his work office, yet before he can do so, a fellow maniac beats him to it.
Bob is essentially revered by everyone around him for his "heroic" actions Â he is given a new job, his colleagues no longer think of him as a schmuck, and the sexy office bitch wants to have sex with him, yet the film's real point of contention is Cuthbert's character.
The film carries these questions very well Â it is at times predictable, and occasionally not so, yet it never ceases to lose its sense of intrigue.
The film's examination of the way in which humans operate is not intricate, and verges on syrupy at times, yet what is most entertaining about He Was a Quiet Man is its surreal spirit.
It may be exaggerated, and at times, even humorous, yet its approach is undeniably refreshing, particularly in relation to how the disabled manage to still engage in an active and healthy sex life.
The film follows through with an insane close, yet it is the most manically reasoned, and therefore, perhaps the most realistic end possible (although term "realism" is a very tenuous one in a film as twisted as this).
The ending comes very abruptly, and little is done to satisfy viewer curiosity, yet we are given the vital answers, even if they aren't wholly satisfying, and are a tad questionable.
We are left to ponder several things, yet when the preceding ninety minutes are so intentionally devoid of poignance, the film may simply leave your mind as the final frame does.
The film's worst crime may be never allowing us to particularly care for Bob (or anyone) as much as we did for D-Fens in Schumacher's film, yet even despite its relative superficiality, He Was a Quiet Man remains a thoroughly entertaining, inventive and quirky film that will have nihilists the world over utterly dumbfounded (myself included).
It is unfortunate that this film, embracing its flaws as it so flagrantly does, has yet to find a large audience, and as such, it instantly becomes one of the indie staples of 2007.
It seems so simple, yet so difficult.
I always love the work of David Lynch, and this is by far his best work yet.
Movies are imaginary concepts, yet we all get caught in the net,like lost fish.
However, Lynch goes much further here stylistically than he has before, making very effective use of digital's simplicity (even as his montage and musical mixing reaches new levels of intensity) and making what is surely his most detailed and intricate film yet.
Laura Dern is absolutely incredible as the lead, giving one of if not her best screen performance yet.
As time perpetually folds back in on itself and the film's visual motifs begin to pile up, it becomes clear that this is Lynch's most daring and bizarre film yet.
It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.
One must keep in mind that none of the performers had any clue as to the purpose and meaning of Mulholland Dr. And yet Laura Dern, Grace Zabriskie, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, Julia Ormond and a few from Poland I'm not familiar with succeeded in giving such interesting, dynamic and subtle performances.
And yet the same performances were used in "Inland Empire".
Lynch entirely abandons the basic grid of "modern" narrative, yet manages to tell a story.
There is yet another woman, she is "bound", just like a circus animal, someone controls her.
But yet, there is an escape.... that epiphanic closing sequence where Dern finishes the shoot, breaks away from the director and sees herself on screen - now outside the movie - is followed by her killing the sinister phantom and embracing the tearful Polish girl... its a serene, goose-pimply moment of release and self-discovery.
If Mulholland Drive was 25% a dark and surreal suspense thriller ghost story and journey into the nether regions of the mind and 75% classical, yet not necessarily structural or connected narrative, Inland Empire is 10% straight narrative and 90% raw psychological horror ghost story.
This is David Lynch's most powerful film and speaks volumes on the many unexplored topics of how this medium can communicate, terrify, and heal in ways we have not yet even begun to understand.
Thus it's a return to youthful beginnings and yet something completely new.
The downside to this is that Lynch is sort of repeating himself and I hope that doesn't mean he's out of ideas or perhaps Mulholland Dr. did not yet exercise his disdain for the studio system.
The film is suffocating, dark and endless yet paradoxically contains some of the director's funniest and lightest scenes.
Very few movies have the overall excellence of this one..."My Favorite Year" melds together a superior script, outstanding ensemble cast, and outstanding direction from Richard Benjamin...and the crowning achievement of it all is the tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole...Mr. O'Toole takes a character that potentially could have been a buffoon and creates a hilarious yet touching portrayal of an aging action film star who has to do American TV for his "new business associate- the IRS"...assigned to watch over our British invader is Mark Lynn-Baker, who is lucky to still have hair by the end of the show...which by the way is one of the cooler endings ever...and ya gotta get the movie to see it for yourself...I could say something wonderful about each member of the cast...and you'll want to pay particular attention to Joseph Bologna as "King Kaiser"...in fact, rent this movie, enjoy it, then buy it...you can watch it over and over again and love it each time...one note...the scene with the firehose on the roof is one of the funniest movie sequences ever...but it is all good...and I loved it!
Oscar nominated again for his work here Peter lost yet again and that's a shame because he's excellent and shows he has a real gift for comedy.Other performances to keep an eye out for include Lainie Kazan as Benjys mum Belle who tells Alan a few home truths and Lou Jacobi as Benjys Uncle Morty.Funny,poignant and well acted this is one that deserves more attention than it's had and is one to watch especially if you need cheering up a classic.
We had heard so many stories from my parents about Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle, yet I never knew what to expect from this film.
It was sad, though, to see Selma Diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the "Late Selma Diamoind" as lung cancer would claim yet another life.
O'Toole gives the performance of a lifetime as Swann, an alternately laugh out loud funny and heartbreakingly warm performance that earned him an Oscar nomination, yet somehow Linn-Baker somehow manages to hold his own and never allows O'Toole to blow him off the screen.
This may not sound exciting, yet I found inspiration in the many displays of quiet sincerity throughout the film.
If you have not yet gone over to DVD, be aware that this film is also available on VHS.
A Dali painting by way of a French New Wave film, the wildly unpredictable head trip of the aptly titled "Mind Game" beguiles all logical conventions, presented in dumbfounding temporal edits, inebriating close-up transitions, and varying degrees of crude yet proficient artworks.
It is not a conventional narrative, yet the narrative clips along like a kayaker on speed.
The overall plot is unimportant yet is completely engaging and satisfying.
The plot is decent (for the time) and improbable yet not impossible.
None of them are worth putting in the film--yet they make up 80% of the movie!!
This film marks out an approach that sadly was not taken up in British film-making more widely; it takes its time to get precisely nowhere, and yet everywhere, in comparison with so many things we call 'films'.
This movie is a commendable attempt at telling the story of a simple, yet brave man and thus well-deservedly (50 years later!)
In yet another random event Â this film is a series of random events Â we have a dream sequence involving a woman in a gown kneeling by a pool who meets an idiot in a racing car by a tree.
Wonderful,yet brooding storytelling,likeable characters (especially Surlent and Pipin),great soundtrack and wonderful scenario scenes.
Dickerson's directorial manner is sleek and balanced, his camera and editing preferences are not as out there and in-your-face as Spike Lee, yet he knows exactly where to put the camera for each scene (the cross-cutting police interrogation sequence is most dynamic, better than that of "The Usual Suspects" and it pre-dates that film by 3 years as well).
also had a minor, yet unforgettable, role in anthony minghella's 'the english patient', in the interrogation scene with willem dafoe.
And, last but not least: A tribute to passion, to what is called "Fernweh" in German, the need to get out of where you are right now and see the whole big world, without - in my impression - forgetting the loneliness that accompanies the traveler who doesn't quite know where he belongs (yet?).
And yet, Petulia is (like the character herself!)
Yes it is a slice of life, in the vein of the theatre of the absurd...yet it made so much sense as I was watching it.
The guests all looking very mod yet rich and "establishment," many of them over 50.
at its release and has yet to be "rediscovered."
Moving on to smaller, yet crucial aspects of the film, the sound, musical score, and lightning is so sickeningly off in almost every single scene that it hurts to watch.
And--as pointed out in another post--he had known for some time that the scanner business wasn't panning out...yet he persists, forcing his wife to work double shifts, letting both rent and taxes fall dangerously behind.
The parts of the movie that have been criticized, mainly by those that have yet to see the film, are easily negated by watching the movie.
I have been a fan of Will Smith for years and I have to say this may be his best film yet!
My family has been through some tough times, and this movie just reminded me of how much my parents struggled to provide for our family and yet kept life fun as much as they could.
), and a hackneyed "it ain't over yet!"
Wyatt Earp is portrayd as an at sometimes ruthless character, yet someone who cares for his close family and friends.
Gavin Hood's THE STOREKEEPER is a mini-masterpiece of filmmaking, a film short with no dialogue, yet with very moving characters, whose facial expressions and body language make the short work.
We know exactly what'll happen as the story progresses, yet we're powerless to stop it.
Kevin Costner considers himself God's gift to women, yet deep down, he has a frightening streak of sexism that affects all his work.
It's epically enormous and tells a story of a man that could only be fiction and yet was a real person.
But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology?
There's plenty of drug use, gore and violence to propel the film especially on the troubled former hero of the picture with his nature of course and it's one of the most underrated war-related movies yet that has gained a cult following.
Combat Shock is hands down, the most depressing movie I have ever seen, yet laughing just kind of came natural, but I would imagine you would need a rather dark sense of humor to see any humor in this at all, but believe me, it is totally there, it's just that it's overshadowed by the morbid, nightmarish, grittiness of it all.
It depicts a veteran roaming the streets trying to make money yet maintain a sense of morality.
This is by no means an uplifting film and yet it has a certain gritty nastiness about it that's compelling to watch, kind of like a car accident where you don't want to look but can't stop yourself from doing it anyway.
This guy is cut up because he's seventeen and hasn't lost his virginity yet, and so turns to his teacher friend, Michael McDrew, for help.
But he does do a nice thing for Ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after Ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by Telly Savalas's character, Sam Surcher.
That cultural barrier had not yet been breached by Hollywood.
This is one of the most touchingly accurate portrayal of lesbian life and loves I've seen yet.
All in all a thoughtful and yet entertaining piece of work.
The sex scenes are sexy and yet tasteful.
Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone are funny, yet convincing as a couple.
I was surprised to find Dennis Dugan had directed it, because he's usually one of Sandler's better collaborators; yet this film is totally amateurish and incomprehensible.
They were sloppy, yet contained a maniacal sense of anarchic glee.
With a Wham!-inspired haircut and a penchant for shtupping elderly women, he finds employment at a small salon run by the sweet, yet blank, Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a Palestinian woman with no patience for Zohan's sexism.
The film is amazingly hostile and mean-spirited, mocking its targets with unfiltered scorn for the majority of the running time, yet tacking on a "we're all the same" message at the end.
It's a bit of a shame that the IMDb hasn't got a cover image of "Dark Tower" published yet.
The plot is simple yet writer Bryan Hill allows more focus on characters, clearly in the style of directors like Michael Mann.
Again it's plentiful, yet the action is different in style.
He doesn't over-stretch himself as many action stars have been prone too, yet he raises his level of performance and does well.
Anyway, basically what we have here is yet another haunted house flick.
Ghosthouse (La Casa 3) is a decent, yet flawed haunted house chiller directed by Umberto Lenzi (under the painfully obvious pseudonym, Humphrey Humbert.
I will never understand how this film manages to be so cheesy yet so creepy at the same time, but Ghosthouse pulls it off with ease.
And yet, when I think about "2001: A Space Odyssey" I must admit that 'Knowing' pales in comparison.
although some have yet to happen, including something very, very big.
This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures.
Except there are 3 events that have yet to occur.
This is one of those, and yet it isn't.
It doesn't bore you, it doesn't make you feel like you've seen it before, and yet you have a comfortability with it that intrigues you throughout.
This film addresses a niche which is not mainstream, but real...disappointed Americans living and working , trying their best, yet opposed by the realities.
Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet.
KEANE is fine example of film-making with a low budget that brings to life this side of society we pass every day, yet rarely interact with or want to acknowledge.
This film is heavy on story, yet is a positive for the film as it allows the audience to form its own opinion of Keane and his life.
The movie is heartbreaking and hopeful but yet unpretentious and simply told.
Chilling, yet strangely warm, this film left me with more questions than answers and an empathy towards the character and the subject of mental illness as a whole than I have ever experienced.
This love affair led to the birth of a very unique creature - not a human being, yet not fully demon either.
Other famous characters include the lecherous yet lovable monk Miroku and the feisty demon slayer Sango.
Sesshomaru's character throughout the show has always been dark and secret, yet in the film we see more to what his father meant to him and just what kind of a person he is.
"Screamers" *is* a nice little surprise, worth looking into for science-fiction buffs who have yet to see it.
The brief, yet intense scenes, constantly engage the viewer.
Date Movie was a movie that I thought would turn out to be hilarious, but yet, it turned out to be incredibly stupid, senseless, and unfunny as possible!!
She's not up to a Leslie Nielsen standard yet, but she's getting better with each installment.
With once having sat through twelve hours of constipation, I have yet to sit through a dump that was more excruciatingly painful than watching this two hour film.
The concept was great, and "date movies" are ripe for being made fun of... yet somehow this just wasn't it.
Michael Pare to me has always been hit or miss so while I quite enjoyed the amusing antics of such stupid (yet fun) movies like Instant Justice and World Gone Wild, I was expecting a level of magical dumbness that would make one gleeful of it's absurdities.
On top of all this, there's a testosterone-sodden bi-line about these violent scum-of-the-earth criminals (who are yet still exceptional enough to be qualified helicopter pilots) that makes 'Shawshank' seem like a holiday-camp.
We've all seen this type of movie a million times and yet we keep paying to see it again and again.
Waliking into the cinema i could tell that this would film would be a drag and yet i still watched the whole movie.
Never once is it considered what a shallow, time-serving person Jenny is for allowing a man to think she is "in love" with him, yet hoping - longing - to be rescued from his embrace by someone whom she believes she loves more.
So after hammering home the idiocy that marriage will keep you from misery, the movie shows us explicitly how a marriage can BE misery (for HER as she pines for her "True Love"; for HIM as he never gets through to her completely), yet it never recants from its demonstrably incorrect platitude.
One scene that I shook my head in utter disbelief was when the lead character just groped an older lady's breast at a bar, and yet she made no effort to slap him or talk him down...would women seriously let a guy do this?
He supposedly broke her heart, yet she continues to like him and even treat him with some sort of respect, despite the fact he never treats anyone with any respect - not even his own brother at times.
Finally there is the photograph that he has apparently been caring in his wallet his whole life (yet it isn't folded).
In 1897, David Eastwick was born, yet in 1902 he was nine years old, five years after being born.
Nancy Eastwick was born around that time, yet her fake gravestone read 1906.
Josh would have been around ten years older than Eastwick, yet they appeared to be the same age when they got old.
Josh's narration states Eastwick was born around 1878, yet it appears his actual age is unknown due to him being raised on the streets.
From out of nowhere he built an empire, yet like any man who tries to write his will across the sky, he paid the price'
This is one of the great westerns made for TV that in someone's infinite wisdom isn't available yet and may never be.
Nothing was answered, situations were randomly created, and why was Viggo Mortensen's character so underdeveloped, yet so vital to the story?
Its first twenty minutes are so painfully nonsensical and over stylized you can't help but cringe in anger, yet after those initial phases of ridiculous OTT poppiness blow over, the project reveals itself as quite enjoyable.
His portrayal of a man tempered by constant rejection, yet bravely holding on to dignity and hope that the next audition brings, is fascinating.
The graphics are the best any Spider-Man video game has seen yet and a step up from the Superman Returns video game graphics.
This is disappointing, as Sandman and Venom were two of the super villains I was most looking forward to fighting, and yet the only fights with them are exactly the same as in the movie - and less!
I haven't yet played Spider-Man 3 for PC (which is a port of the Xbox 360 and PS3 version) but I am sure it is better than the PS2 version.
This movie is crammed with memorable scenes, subtle parody and excellent, yet quite humorous horror.
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.
Feast does its best to throw all Horror clichÃ©s out the window yet it doesn't try to be anything it is not meant to be.
I have been making my way through some horror movies I had not seen yet (May, A Tale of Two Sisters, etc...) when I ran across this title.
The film's structure is dauntingly clear yet purposeful, provocatively reenacting one crucial decision in order to illustrate the immutability of Eddie's fate.
It does explain a great deal about the behaviour and posturing of Western "intellectuals" who endorse freedom and the revolutionary pursuit of the liberation of oppressed and minorities yet who consistently support those movements and institutions that most obstruct such trends: previously the Soviet Union, today reactionary Islam.
Not only is this a major contention, offered as an assumption without any supporting evidence, but it implicitly concedes that there is substance to the "bleak" contention, such that an "alternative" is warranted, whilst yet again dodging the real issue: is it or is it not true?
Overall, a very so-wrong, yet it's so-right way to spend a few hours.
The humor is deep and serves to address important, yet rarely talked about issues in the world today.
I haven't read the book yet, but am going to now that I know there is one.
It's at times mythical, poignant, and yet disturbingly absurd.
I still have yet to see more Bronson classics but I'm just getting started and this one definitely 'wowed' me.
Another story had Mr.Meaker turn into a budgie, and in yet another, his wife became a cocker spaniel.
I haven't seen that many Thai movies (yet) but those I have seen (among them the brilliant "Tears of the Black Tiger", the impressive "Nang Nak", the sensual "Jan Dara" and the entertaining "303 Fear Faith Revenge") made me curious for more.
If you haven't seen it yet, check it out on the DVD.
No one has seen him in Run Ronnie Run yet, because at the time I'm writing this review, that movie has yet to be released because of it's extremely vulgar content (much of which involves a song performance by Jack Black), but I seriously hope they get moving on that.
but we here in the Netherlands haven't got to that point yet).
face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality.
I love the final scene anyway, with Columbo's funny yet unnerving imitation of a magician's stage technique.
He is like the little brother who wants to be so much like Tony and yet at times not so such.
Season 3 was a very ruff one, were mistakes and chance are all the time, 4 was just human, and 5... Well, 5 has not shown up yet down here at Mexico, but I have heard that is good.
This is the team (I'm not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.
LaPaglia, one of my favorite actors, gives a complex yet sublime turn as the slightly arrogant and apparently clueless titular character.
He is matched note for note by Davis (last seen on screen in a small yet memorable performance in Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center"), imbuing Tonya with dignity yet allowing her inner indignations brim to the surface not unlike a Sameul L. Jackson character.
They have two teenage children - Christine (a very fine young actress Hayden Panettiere) who at age 15 is aware of her body and yet fearful of its implications in her interactions with boys and men, and Martin (Sebastian Stan) who has returned home from school as a drop out whose mind is preoccupied with soul searching.
Christina naively begins to frequent bars and is protected by a truck driver Joe (the very fine actor Walton Goggins) who kindly introduces her to the realities facing hormonally charged yet fearful young girls.
A note to those who haven't seen it yet: watch all the way past the end credits.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
I haven't seen the first part of this series yet, and I'm looking forward to it.
What makes this scene funny is the fact that they have already murdered several people throughout the course of the film, and yet when they hit the dog, they show more genuine emotion for hitting this animal than for murdering another human being.
And yet the viewer will still get the feeling that they didn't show enough emotion for the dog either.
Its the centrepiece of the Evil Dead Trilogy and yet it feels a little like a remake of the original, it does follow on from the events of the first film but the similarities between the two are very apparent.
This movie is equal to the original Evil Dead, here we have ASH the lone survivor from the first encounter with the evil dead, fighting off the deadites yet again.
So all of this is always fascinating, seeing this 'version' of Bergman's parents and their struggles to be together- Henrik the sort of cold yet compassionate loner parish/priest, and Anna the very warm and heartfelt soon-to-be-mother- as they both have head-strong tendencies.
It's in this section that the flaws arise, but not big ones, only enough to keep it odd yet intriguing.
They are parts which have been put into a whole and made coherent, somehow; but yet, I will go back to see this movie one more time.
The director has proved himself yet again that he is simply the best there is in the world of cinema...HE makes South Asians Proud!
Rai is slated to play Anarkali opposite Ben Kingsley's Shah Jahan in an upcoming film and has yet another role as the pining courtesan in Bhansalli's next, "Bajirao Mastani."
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
The reason being is that actress Penelope Cruz, may be working with him in a yet untitled Bollywood movie, which is said to be directed by his father, Rakesh Roshan.
I was completely awestruck by his power-packed performance as the stern yet kind-hearted Akbar.
where being hauled off in cattle trains by the minute, Nazis shoot people as sport and seize control of government, homes, businesses and yet a menage a trois was living a happy dissolute life because they have each other... that's suppose to be touching?!
It is realistic yet playful, bitter but hope-inducing.
As I stepped from my carriage, the sight of my new school filled me with fear and apprehension, yet, I was swept with a wave of curiosity.
However, after the director addressed us all, also announcing that he added a sepia tone color to the print, oh and by the way, he hasn't seen this print yet, so please comment afterwards!
Overall- It's a very good thriller with an excellent unseen twist, yet I don't feel it delivered.
the storyline is wicked and i never get bored of watching it, kind of disgusting some of it, but I'm only 14 so i haven't seen any films worse than that,(yet).first time watching it i had to keep pausing it.
Also, I found some parts of it gross, like when that police officer is in the basement and they show his icky face...o_O Although I rate this movie 8/10, overall I found this film scary yet interesting.
As I had read previously, Ms. Ross didn't seek to imitate Billie Holiday's style, and instead created a distinct and appropriate - yet similar - jazz style of her own just for the movie (check out "Good Morning Heartache"), and I, being a fan, didn't mind the song interludes.
The best of these is near the end of the film when Joan has to pull off a dinner party for some of John's potential clients without having them know about the mayhem going on behind the scenes, yet she is thwarted quite hilariously at every turn.
He plays love interest John Fletcher with a world weary yet charming air, as only he could do.
If you haven't seen it yet,I recommend that you do.Even if you don't have a child to share this movie with, you will enjoy the very endearing Nanny McPhee(warts and all).
it is not the classical English film either as the family is placed in an out of time and out of space atmosphere unlike the clear and cozy spaces of other English stories.i would rather say that the film is imprinted with Emma Thompson's personal touch which makes it a beautiful yet strange film in its own way.
as she helped the distinctly intelligent yet naive Brown children turn their behaviours to the good.
Very profound, yet the true dialogue is not in the DVD and may only exist in the book.
The crusading tone of the last third is a tad heavy, but the ending - both ritually stylised and yet realistically performed - makes its point far better than the courtroom speeches.
Maybe I'm not the most objective person to comment on it since I really like those complicated, layered, troubled-but-good-at-heart characters, yet, this one was amazing...it's just a shame that this gem will probably be slept on since it isn't any kind of blockbuster or even an indie movie that could shake some spirits.
And the wife is afraid of heights, yet about half the things they do require heights and she just exclaims how scared she is every time...and how happy she was she ignored it after they're done.
They live in abandonment and are disregarded by society, yet all of them are such lovable characters, and some of the run ins with the secondary characters are just hilarious.
I love Pam Ferris too, and she gives yet another strong performance as Ma.
One can see in this man's eyes a distinct hatred for the men that keep him down, yet, he makes a fatal mistake that will prove fatal.
They refused to be pushed around and their tactics were crude, yet effective.
Solid direction and a perverse yet fresh and interesting script aside, the acting for me is what carried this film.
Some of the material is just flat out stupid and raw, yet it entertains, and if blue is your favorite color, which it is mine, I'm sure you won't find the over-use of it annoying, haha.
We like the low budget movies that try so hard, and yet end up being somewhat less then serious.
Specifics: Lohan works in a strip club where women are topless, yet she never takes the top off and even in sheer bra has pasties on (or were the pasties on top of the bra?).
We are asked to follow Rene's reactions to the murder, social ostracism, artistic failure etc., and yet we're not told whether he's the murderer or not, or any of the other characters, which would surely be a crucial element in anyone's psychology!
It is a name-only sequel to the solid yet way tamer Art of The Devil.
I would highly recommend that anyone who hasn't yet had the opportunity or good fortune to see this wonderful comedy..see it.
Don't miss it if you haven't seen it yet.
To appreciate it you have to remember two things - firstly, it was made in 1942, and thus there are quite a few patriotic themes in the movie, since that was the kind of film being made at the beginning of World War II, when the U.S. didn't yet know if it would be successful fighting a two front war in which everything was at stake.
(As of this writing, 2/05/05, it is not yet on DVD.)
While the plot is thoroughly predictable (and, yet, therein lies part of its appeal), it's made with the customary professionalism one associates with the golden age of Hollywood; thus, we're treated to a handsomely-shot large-scale entertainment Â complemented by a fine Franz Waxman score which goes from lush to emphatic or rousing, depending on the mood of any given scene.
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
I don't think I've met a cartoon yet that I've loved since Episode I.
"He-Man" and "She-Ra" were likely THE defining cartoons of the 1980s, yet I have heard of no plans to release the film on DVD.
He has put together some not-so-famous actors, and yet he managed to make them more trustworthy than most of the more famous actors.
However, was not The Day the Earth Stood Still cheezy too, yet it is one of the greatest movies of all times, most people agree.
Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth.
The knowledge of the affair yet his love for his beautiful wife and best friend wage war inside of his mind...
He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed.
You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn't completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven't been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don't make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don't really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you'll like.
Have yet to view a movie based on a Dick story that wasn't enjoyable, e.g., Blade Runner, Minority Report.
Here you have 4 women who are capable of so much more in their life, yet they're so afraid to act on their dreams that they settle for crappy temp jobs.
It's a movie based on homosexuality in a very macho environment, and yet, there is nothing expressly queer about Yossi and Jagger's relationship--this is a love story and a human story more than a gay story.
Eytan Fox's direction is comparable to another Hebraic effort, Amos Guttman's "Hessed Mufla" (1992) in its subtle yet realistic depictions.
Of all the films I've seen, this one is one of the simplest, yet also one of the most effective depictions of gay love that I have seen in the cinema.
Yes...perhaps...and yet...
The story of Yossi and Jagger is presented without phony touches, that in the hands of another director, of worse yet, a Hollywood studio, would have been meaningless.
Better yet, before the credits, it says that All About Us became a best selling DVD.
It isn't even out yet on DVD, (Today's date 06/22/08, street date for the movie 07/01/08) so how can it be a best seller already!!!
It's been almost 60 years since the films release, and yet today, it remain as relevant as ever, as still the biggest stars in the world, gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film.
And yet the world goes on, and we keep dreaming about fame and fortune.
Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does.
-- again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness, yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.
Everyone tends to remember Swanson's over-the-top stylized performance: yet her total control as an actress, and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness, however fleeting, are something to behold.
Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth "young fellow" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.
I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.
Plus the guy who played Jack of All Trades was great (don't want to reveal the name for those yet to watch the show).
'Charlie' Mayeaux (Liam Neeson) is a bummed out DEA agent fresh from a bungled case yet given an important assignment to break a Columbian drug cartel represented by Fidel (JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga) and his boyfriend Estuvio (Michael DeLorenzo).
The spontaneous actions,style & quips of this zany grand insanity of unusual lifestyles & eclectic characters being thrust into an quite unusual situation,under the intense pressure of a bunch of grandiose yet charismatic lunatics,kept me constantly yearning for more of that unique chemistry,prolific dialog & unforeseen situations that earmarked this film as an all time favorite of mine!
...And for Heavens sake, smile, as you may have the misfortune of being one of those dysfunctional, yet incredibly lovable, misfits!
Erik Blakeney has written and directed a film that should have been seen by a wider audience, yet, this movie came and went without fanfare.
Some of the lines the actors deliver were so incredibly vapid yet delivered so deadpan that I could not control my laughter, sometimes the sets alone were enough to make me giggle.
The next contest featuring Sean O' Haire accompanied with Roddy Piper who had insulted O' Haires opponent Rikishi this was the worst match of the night only lasting 6 minutes with O'Haire using a death valley driver to pick up the impressive yet boring win.
The denouement is as sad and shocking as any in cinematic history, yet this film with its warmth and beauty and insight will surely light a fire in even the coldest of hearts.
And yet, after all those viewings, I didn't realize the important lessons it teaches.
They cut a lot of the book out, yet fill in few of the gaps with explanations.
They also skipped really quickly over important scenes and yet took ten minutes on the Samwise the Strong scene which, while important should not take up quite that much time, especially since they had to cut the book down so much to fit it into a movie.
I have yet to see the 1960's remake (or 1950's?)
Her performance is less memorable than Ms. Beavers', yet she hits the bull's-eye.
IT's a once in a lifetime event and I wasn't even born yet.
With Woody taking a small role (literally) as an anxious sperm awaiting for his first and only mission, the segment is silly, yet true enough to almost be worthy of inclusion in a basic biology class.
True, this 1972 collection of extremely lewd skits isn't quite as impressive and thought-provoking as some of Allen's best works, like 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' or for that matter even the follow-up 'Sleeper'; yet there's an energy to 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know' that Allen has not shown for at least a decade, and in that light it's still entirely classic.
It is unintentionally more funny than scary and obviously the makers of this pathetic waste of film thought we'd all enjoy a typical, yet much more awful, teen slasher flick.
I believe the movie was typical yet good.
To whit: the coach gets fired, yet hangs around the parking lot to harass a teacher (Cannell), and he doesn't do anything about it.
Story plot: At a small border-post on the Yugoslav-Albanian border, yet another generation of soldiers suffering the usual amount of boredom awaits the end of their service, counting days to the moment when they should take their uniforms off for good.
This is the best Disney sequel yet, even better than enjoyable efforts like the Lion King sequels.
It was very funny yet it was also a strong story showing Bambi getting to know his father, very emotional at some points!
Produced by the Shaw Brothers, who usually cranked out extravagant chopsocky costumers by the dozens and shot on a conspicuously paltry budget of what appears to be several rolls worth of quarters, this utterly inept, yet always entertaining and frequently sidesplitting tale of gorgeous jungle honey Samantha (the beautiful, curvaceous, flaxen-tressed Euro minx Evelyn Kraft, giving the viewers am amazing eyeful in a scanty, revealing fur bikini outfit that leaves precious little to the imagination) and the fearsome, village-stomping behemoth ape who's her best friend is not to be missed.
), and, most importantly, a certain cheerfully off-target, yet still unyielding and unbridled go-for-it hearty gusto which blithely permeates every last fabulously fumbled frame -- this choice chunk of delectably dreadful cinematic cheese rates as essential viewing for hardcore bad film buffs.
His character is complex as he misses earth, yet has submitted to being stuck on Sirius 6B.
It is so breathtakingly unexpected, yet perfectly fitted, it's almost impossible to think that it wasn't somehow planned from the first episode!
This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
3) There are several subplots that are terrible, yet un-finished.
I was shocked at how empty and limp the stories were, though punctuated by increasingly spectacular yet predictable 'shouts' with associated danger, drama and of course death.
- yet these elements fail to gel this time round.
It had no story, yet the actors were OK, they used cheap tricks to scare us, some were unwillingly funny as the computer graphics were plainly horrible.
And yet, this happens throughout the film and makes viewing and enjoying it next to impossible.
He cheats on his girlfriend, throws parties, yet goes through NO journey in the film.
In what is yet another bad juvenile delinquent movie from the moralistic 1950s, four "teenage" girls rob a gas station, erase a classroom chalkboard, and do other vile things.
But the judge isn't through yet.
If you come from outside of Norway and yet haven't seen it, I will recommend FlÃ¥klypa!
argument yet again, until the slow walking psycho catches up to them.
Two famous personalities from Victorian England, and yet Hollywood can't be bothered giving them English accents.
Mighty Joe Young (1949)  As a movie it's pretty awful, but Harryhausen fans take note  Wow, there sure are some silly moments and bad acting in this movie--and yet I watched it to the end!
Also, the flying monkeys/humans, which I am supposing must either be a complete yet poorly done copy of those in "The Wizard of Oz" or the missing links between chimpanzees, humans and bats.
'Lost city of gold is yet again made by the prolific masters of mindless action Golan/Globus and their B Movie studio Cannon Films.
The main character is a clown yet the actor who plays him has no sense of comedic timing.
What's even worse is that this was a View Askew production, I've yet to see a bad one (until today).
One thing I noticed, that struck me as odd, the peer group Evie hangs out with seem to be in their late teens or early twenties, yet Lili Taylor looks to me like she's kicking thirty or better.
It is among the five best movies I have ever seen, and the best puppet-animated movie yet, and is well overdue a place among the top 250 here on IMDb.
It reminds me of being at a spouse's company party and hearing people reference people and projects that you know and understand nothing about -- yet you do not have the option of leaving the party.
Due to his death, he brings nothing new to the table, yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film.
Also annoying is the fact it is set in Boston, yet I hear ZERO Boston dialect!
I saw this film in 1976 and was very disappointed.Of all of the most ribald yet, low- level comedic films of the 70's("The Groove tube".
I can just imagine the "behind the scenes" dialogue while making this picture: "this is going to be such a cute movie, the story is so cute, the dialogue is so cute, the actors are so cute, the acting is so cute, no the acting is so dynamic, it's going to be such a hit with the audience: being so piquant and lovely, and yet so comical........" I don't know too much about the Back Street Boys, except that they're famous, now I realize they must have made some money and thought they were going to make a classic film, they were wrong, money doesn't always translate into good taste.
It helps me sleep a little better to tell myself they had to realize how bad this film was... and yet, methinks they didn't.
This movie is pretentious and trying to be profound, yet it is actually a complete joke.
And yet, the mini-series is most popular with women under 18 or over 45.
Whoever it was, please do try to understand the actual book before doing it again (better yet, don't do it ever again).
And yet, I still have nothing good to say.
It wouldn't be half as bad, granted, but still not yet good either.
Whether you are a die hard Dudikoff fan or a newbie to his movies, this one is yet another great offering from Dudikoff.
Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was.
All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless.
My brother and I watched the first 15 minutes of this movie and both decided it was boring and we were getting nothing out of the movie, yet we decided to give it a while longer to see if it got any better.
Olvier Gruner stars as J269 a robot who becomes the target of a group of mercenaries sent to destroy him after he kills a man trying to rape Nora Rochester (Daphne Ashbrook), fearing bad press Goddard Marx orders the machine dead in this well made yet very routine rip off of Robocop and The Terminator.
Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!!
I must admit I haven't seen all movies starring Rutger Hauer yet, so I'm not sure, but my guess is that BEYOND JUSTICE (aka THE LAW OF THE DESERT) has got to be the worst Hauer-movie out there.
At the time of shooting this movie he clearly hadn't developed his method-acting-skills yet.
Yes, they were able to eloquently throw around the term "disenfranchised," yet had no clue as to why these characters chose the streets.
All star cast yet a let down.
Very slow story line there was a slight yet predictable plot twist.
One example of how ineffective this film is: I am scared to death of cockroaches, yet the scene containing cockroaches in this movie didn't scare me in the least.
The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a psychiatric unit), is directed to his room "first door on the left," she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh, so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway before she's back in the same corridor!
Or better yet, go and see Ringu, it's atmosphere and creep factor outshine both of these films.
Olyphant did a good job because he was calm, yet you could feel the fury and rage burning inside him.
and hasn't been officially released yet.
(Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title might change.
The technology is impressive, but not yet to the level necessary to express the emotions a good actor can.
As I sat in the theater, two things kept crossing my mind: Is this really the same Julie Deply I know from Blue (1993); followed by: has it been 93 minutes yet?
I saw the oldest boy wearing Nikes and jeans in one scene, yet when they finally left the house they were wearing clothes that have been outdated 50 years earlier than 1987 when the film was made.
The book's climax is not dramatic, yet far more thrilling than this crap about the kids meeting their new stepfather.
The story is unclear and messy; yet another example of the fact that Hong Kong commercial cinema has never discovered the importance of a clear plot.
I haven't seen it yet, and, truthfully, I may not bother, because it looks like it's more of exactly the same.
Peacock King is yet another movie in which Yuen Biao is pretty much wasted.
given it's Adult certificate - yet another disappointment.
Better yet, probably the worst film of all time.
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.
She meets yet another person - a male - who had also run away from his house - for again the same reason - Mediocre Life style.
After all they were foolish Indians- bred in remote Indian village - where it is thought that Abortion is a sin !SO when she was about to deliver, the Police Officer catches them - they escape yet again - but caught eventually but left on emotional grounds - marveling at their sharp brain and innocent hearts !!
Hard hitting dramas and stepping into the horror/thriller genre, yet a corner stone of the Australian film industry has been the under dog tale; the little guy taking on the big man.
Mick Molloy struck a vein of freshness with Crackerjack; an under dog tale itself, yet mixed great comedy while nicely taking a stab at lawn bowls.
Then there is the fact that it is called hyperspace, yet I don't think it mentions higher dimensional space anywhere in the documentary.
Charles and Harry clearly detest one another after being together for so long, yet they can't possibly envision their lives without each other.
The story is weak, but worse yet the witty scripting from the original is completely absent.
The short three films that he devoted himself to wasn't enough for my taste buds, and I think the majority of film aficionados would heartily agree Â yet I would have to say that those seeking the knowledge of James Dean, the truth behind his life and his devotion to youthfulness Â should not (repeat NOT) watch this horrid film.
- This is nitpicking, but the game between the Devils and the Tampa Bay Lightning was billed as "the Stanley Cup", yet the Stanley Cup cannot be played for between those two teams as they are in the same conference.
A good allegory would answer these questions within the structure of the allegory, yet in this film we have to ignore these and other questions in order for the film to work.
I can't understand how many filmmakers there are out there who have no real understanding of any part of this wonderful medium yet they get money to make films all the same.
The killer spends a lot of time off-screen as the two girls run around trying to find a phone, easy prey yet the predator seems little inspired to catch them.
Poor script, poor characters, poor dialogue, worst psychopath ever, no idea what happened to the driver of the car -- yet, this made it to the video store.
This is the PERFECT time for the killer to kill the girls, mainly Because they both STAND BY THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES before walking away, yet the killer seems to care less.
The whole movie is supposed to be happening at night yet there are scenes where you can see daylight in the background.
the ships will be 70 years from home, yet we meet Ferengi, Klingon's and a Romulan across the series... so much for leaving those species in the alpha quadrant.
all in all the show sucks, in star trek 4 Scotty comes across a way to re-crystalize dilithium, yet 100 years later voyager cannot do this so they need to enter dangerous nebula's to get more fuel... hmm.
I decided to watch the second season of "Project Greenlight" and yet again it was the search for a screenplay to finance and a director.
So, "The Battle of Shaker Heights" was made and released, and yet again after watching I realized it's still more contrived, fluffy, and safe offerings into the film world.
She's a bit of a tease towards Kelly giving him little smiles and flirty come on's yet gets angered when he responds.
He befriends Kelly, talks to him like a friend, yet we're supposed to view him as the bad guy.
Then it's never explained why Kelly falls in love with Tabby in the first place, and we never really get to know Bart outside of his conceptual design as a neat dresser and proper yet friendly guy.
By making a "war film", Boll has proved himself yet again as a completely derivative and wannabe director who is not concerned with either originality, artistic impact or entertainment value.
And to stay true to his vision, the last 50 minutes of this film are some of his worst yet.
The film is so dark, gray, boring, claustrophobic and ugly that it's perhaps his least entertaining movie yet.
So if you've only seen this as American Streetfighter 2, don't judge this movie yet.
This leads into yet another abrupt cut to Taskin talking with Dr. WeiseÂhe wants her to help him look through some files.
The son proves more criminally insane than clinically yet no reason offered why he wasn't institutionalized.
I mean, I have yet to find the film listed where this does not happen.
All right, so he hasn't gotten violent towards his ex-wife yet.
The predictable happy ending is capped off by yet another forgettable dance sequence, making one yearn for the comparably energetic, stylish excellence of "Footloose" or "Dirty Dancing".
Universally, all were woefully inferior to the original in pretty much every way and yet, one can't deny that there was a certain (cheesy) charm to many of them such as Joe D'Amato's, 'Ator The Fighting Eagle' starring one time Tarzan, Miles O'Keeffe.
Like in many haunting movies the colleague dude conveniently left a cassette tape explaining just enough about the bad stuff going on in the house to make the viewer decide not to turn off the movie yet.
There are a few tense moments (the scenes in the cellar) and some striking imagery (such as the blood rising from Freudstein's tomb), yet the film is so disjointed that even these fail to inject any interest.
To add to the silliness, a mysterious babysitter by the name of 'Anne' moves in with the family who seems to know something about the strange happenings related to the cellar, yet is stupid enough to venture down into the dark to get herself 'offed' in a ridiculous fashion involving a butcher knife.
I see about 2 or three martial arts films a week and this was the worst subtitled yet.
Moreover we are expected to sympathise with the Mexican immigrants yet without any of the protagonists in the film being any more than almost comic stereotypes I was left completely cold.
Yes, like it or not, you've yet again entered into the fantasy world of DeCoteau and scripter Matthew Jason Walsh, where ones purity of soul is determined by whether they wear white or black boxer briefs.
I mean come on, the plot involves abducting children for sacrifices, and yet there is virtually no gore or blood in this film!
Milch has said that the underlying theme of Deadwood is the development of order in a culture where laws do not yet exist (Deadwood is in Indian territory, and hence outside of the U.S. proper).
Still I'm glad that this is the last (as of yet) Basket Case movie.
But yet, those scenes where among the most intense, the most unpleasant, painful, desperate and bloody scenes I have ever seen.
It seems he's brought about quite an aura for horrifically bad films, and yet there I was watching Tunnel Rats and genuinely thinking it was a good effort.
This is also one of those movies where the characters act like a bunch of idiots--they know they're trapped in a house with a maniac yet the split up in separate rooms and one decides to take a shower!
At the end though there is an all out monster attack as we regain control of the monsters, but it isn't much fun as it has poor King Gidorah squaring off against way to many monsters, they really should have given him an ally to help him...unfortunately, Gigan and MechaGodzilla had not come into being yet.
His mother tries and often comes close to being an actual, honest-to-goodness, responsible Adult Person, yet ultimately falls short.
Rames has the most interesting character (Too bad the movie was not about him), a hard-boiled yet childish and irresponsible as a father figure.
Just (yet another) disappointed black film goer.  
Background scenes, various machines, and special effects were fascinating, yet all the characters and some other objects were in extremely low quality that reminded me of Playstation polygons.
Overall a decent docudrama which has probably been elevated to cult status by now, as Pamela Smart in real life is now petitioning for yet another appeal.
There was potential for this movie to be a cute yet somewhat cheesy hallmark type, and hey, since it is the holiday season I was fully prepared for that.
Howard Vernon Â a Jess Franco regular Â plays yet another mentally messed up Baron slash doctor slash castle owner.
The characters attend fancy high society parties, yet they ride horses instead of cars.
And Howard Vernon lives isolated in a creepy castle, yet he's perfectly able to perform a complex open-heart surgery?
And yet, underneath all the confusion, implausible story lines and downright horrible dubbing jobs, there is an interesting and obscure exploitation effort to discover.
A movie with fair acting abilities and yet keeps your attention.
of prints gets film terrific openings and it manages to cover itself under "hit" tag yet everyday is not Sunday.
This movie is disgusting, and yet, tries to be funny.
"Deadgirl" was promoted to me as being a perverse and morbid, yet unique and eccentric "coming of age" story for the nowadays adolescent generations.
The "leader" of the vigilantes is a fairly short-sized yet menacing guy with a shiny bald head that would make even Telly Savalas jealous and, during the climax of the film, he goes totally bonkers as well.
the attention of the movie watcher to yet another subplot.... and it is not Steve McQueen in the "Great Escape".
The Secretary-General (a woman, which has not yet happened and may not since none of the Islamic nations, which have a vast, unreasoning fear of women, would vote for her) underplays a pivotal role here, and needed to have appeared a lot more.
I don't like Simon Pegg, I don't find him funny and I've never enjoyed one of his films yet so this review might be just a slight tad biased against the film.
), he's also chained up for a good part of the second half, as if Naschy was as yet unsure how to use his 'creation'.
Better yet, which window to go to?
The ending is a disappointment too; there is yet another plot twist in the last few minutes and the story just stops.
the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious, yet so poorly done as to be comical.
"Nemesis" is the last episode in which Geraldine McEwan dons the mantle of the elderly yet intrepid needle-clicking sleuth (we may, I think, be thankful for the omission of "A Caribbean Mystery"), and it once again takes Dame Agatha's wonderful original tale apart, and reconstitutes it into one that makes little sense, logic, or reason, adds, deletes, and changes characters, presents new plot lines and a new conclusion.
The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school.
Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying " this airport is surrounded by armed coppers " yet Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation .
I recommend to those of you who have yet to see "The Contractor": just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.
This film was seemingly advertised as a romantic comedy, which doesn't usually peak my interest, yet thankfully had little to do with comedy or romance.
Each character has a seemingly decent, if not "wonderful", life and yet when the film digs deeper you notice all the things that are missing and the voids that are left behind.
Theirs was the most heart-wrenching story, I felt, and yet they seemed the most contented in the end.
The writing is the worst part of it, in fact, though the writers did accomplish several feats I had previously assumed were mutually exclusive: they made the plot over-the-top yet unimaginative, the dialogue simple-minded yet smug, and the punchlines clichÃ©d yet unfamiliar (clichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because at some point there were funny, but the ones in My Boys lacked any vestige of humor).
Lorenzo Lamas returns as Renegade cop "Soldier" Jack Kelly who declares war on drug dealers who are cutting the drugs with rat poison in this undistinguished yet semi-fun sequel.
As far as slasher flicks that cast Santa Claus as a mad killer are concerned, this is a passable yet forgettable offering from actor David Hess (in his one and only directorial effort).
One of the main problems, which detracts a lot from the tone and atmosphere, is the lack of snowÂit would have complemented the killer's exploits perfectly, yet there's none to be found.
As usual, the medical nerd is uneasy about making a move on the girl(..she's this lovely gal with a great body who is practically throwing herself at him, yet, as often was the case, he's too nervous, or focused on his studies, to get a clue).
The character's are clichÃ©d, the ghosts are underused & did I mention that it wasn't funny yet?
For those who wish to explore more of Greek cinema, Yannis Economidis' film "Matchbox" would come as a great shock.It is with firm conviction that I state that I am yet to come across any world cinema film in which the actors do nothing but hurl the best of filthy abuses on each other.
Themes were tossed around uselessly in this movie, yet I was not completely bored, the only thing keeping me awake being my icee and the scenes where something would catch on fire.
there is no way that Larissa even had a smithet of a feeling sexually towards him, yet the producers let some stupid viewers to believe that this might not be the case.
Better (or worse) yet, she is able to smuggle of few other inmates out of her facility to help scare the crap out of the teens.
I really really had to stop my self from hitting the fast forward button on my DVD remote, or worse yet, just ejecting the damn thing altogether.
Grace states that she wants Bing to stand on his own feet and be a man again so that she can be free, yet she goes back to him.
When asked if was guilty of the possession of the marijuana Joshua responds "I mean I don't know", yet throughout the film he breaks into poems/raps that clearly display his tremendous vocabulary, you aren't just born knowing these words.
It's clear that he was well educated, yet not very educated in basic laws, or the principals of using your education to get a legal job.
The intentional, yet not clever, cameo of Marion Berry.
Yes, ol' John Carradine is back, playing yet another crotchety old coot, this time in Vampire Men of the Lost Planet, aka Horror of the Blood Monsters, aka about 57 other titles.
Rani Mukherjee, who plays Michelle, a girl blind and deaf from birth, and Amitabh Bachchan, who plays her teacher have been said to have delivered fantastic performances, yet I found it to be their worst performances that I know of.
Rani Mukherjee has her head cocked to one side through the whole film, yet it is only the blind who do that, to catch sound, which is out of the question with Michelle.
I will not go into more details for the sake of those who haven't seen it (yet).
Or better yet, watch His Girl Friday, which was filmed in 1940 with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell (with Hildy Johnson recast as a female reporter).
The one guy who is smart enough to leave/escape, stupidly returns to rescue a girl who then doesn't want to leave until she can save the rest; the guy stupidly follows and gets killed while saving her sorry back yet again.
The good guys got a rifle and a gun, yet the rifle isn't used once in the movie.
Predictably handsome melodrama, yet one which seldom involves the viewer.
He was miserable and yet all the terrible things she did, she saw them as the strengths of their relationship!
Just nudes and erotica, yet, the BAD acting, BAD directing and lack of anything that shows someone put some effort into making this piece of.. film, was Very annoying.
Most characters are pulled from Ilsa - The Wicked Warden (another Franco movie) and yet all I wanted was for Dyanne Thorne to play a cameo.
The tale of "Heidi" is such a groaner that it manages to defeat any little, bright-eyed young actress who stars in it, yet they keep trying.
Foster, who was great in "The Door in the Floor", shows that he's not yet ready to play a lead (and he didn't even have to carry the movie on his shoulders Ã  la Christian Bale; this is a big ensemble where nobody really stands out, and I'm including a pre-Wrestler Mickey Rourke and the late Brad Renfro, who plays the perhaps only likable character, in the list).
Don't pretend you have said something when you haven't yet.
The other most impressive roles were the villains, whose over the top yet convincing performances add to that Disney feel.
How is it, at the end of the movie, that the bulldozers were already on the streets, ready to tear the town down, yet seconds later a fat guy pulls up in a limo and reverses the demolition?
We're expected to believe that he's a Miro scholar/botanist/MBA and man about about town, yet he somehow thinks he could bring a whiter-than-white upper class woman into a "negro" blues bar and the patrons would be "really friendly"?
Which leads me to my main beef: Rock swears up and down to Jenny he loves her, yet clearly enjoys the perks that go with being Lover Doll.
TCM showed the David Niven version of "Raffles" the other night, so I went to check on it in my library and found this movie sitting next to it, that I'd taped years ago but hadn't yet watched.
In my buddies words, "Has anything happened yet?
This little film has a very decent story, fluently written dialogues and some really adequate acting performances, yet it simple can't be called memorable because of the shabbiness of the production.
His performance is very good and he gets to say some very slick lines, yet the movie lacks a lot of action and continuity.
Perhaps this is why a DVD release of the film hasn't happened yet.
It seems to be the answer for the horror urge i needed but yet again i was sadly mistaken so i sit there watching ... waiting with anticipation switching positions to avoid the cursed limbs falling asleep syndrome but to my despair it was nothing of what i hoped it was far from it  Now ill admit i did jump at one part i was playing with my kittens and BAM LADY and i jumped ... but to find out what i mean about the book and the lady watch it ... if your into that whole student film craze if not ... avoid!
They both begin to experience the strange things, yet neither seem interested in revealing those experiences to each other - for no good reason.
I haven't decided yet.
Writers Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are never able to capture any of the hilarious moments that made the '91 flick so successful, yet they did commit the same error that the original movie's writers Ganz and Mandel did in the first, letting proceedings get clumsily sloppy at the close.
Consider the hyenas of The Lion King; science tells us that hyenas are successful hunters and caring parents within their pack, and yet here they've been reduced to stereotype; mangy, miserable poachers.
To make things worse, although she is NOT a rich woman in the film, repeatedly she sports gowns that were right out of Vogue magazine--yet she is supposed to live in Vietnam, not Paris.
Ian MacShane's Swearengen is beyond brilliance...for sheer violence he is more vicious than Tony Soprano or Vic Mackey, yet Swearengen has an intelligence and foresight they both lack.
The rest of the movie is a upsurge to Guru's grand yet powerless argument in the courtroom.
The "brother" subplot was used in the first one, even if they did have yet another brother (man what a cheesy, excuse to do a sequel!
I suppose if David was killed off and it was revealed there was yet ANOTHER brother you'd call it cheesy.
If Jerusalema, the latest film about life in South Africa's underbelly of Hillbrow, can make a film like the award winning Tsotsi look like child's play, you need to ask yourself the question: "Why haven't I seen it yet?"
Woody Allen is not yet out of a job.
Then I wouldn't have spent so many sleepless nights...."   The plot seems cruel and creepy, yet too sit-com-like at the same time.
And most of all, Sleuth is exactly the same story you've seen hundreds of times, yet it expects you to be enthralled.
Anyway, for a reason I have yet to figure out, Jennifer Love Hewitt runs in the rain wearing a sweater and bikini bottom to tell Brandy and the rest of the victims that she ran over Ben Willis 2 years prior and that he went after her and Ray and killed 2 of her friends last year.
Karloff's presence notwithstanding, the entire film has only two interesting scenes: in one, a murder takes place in front of at least ten people, yet nobody notices it at first and they go on playing a guessing game as if nothing had happened; in the other, detective Wong gathers (indirectly) all the murder suspects in his house and explains his various theories in detail, in a sequence that plays very much like an early version of all those "and now all will be revealed!"
This movie is yet another disappointment.
Foreigners occasionally do more than chide Americans for their obsessive love of guns, yet these cops seem to find they come in handy if ineffective in dealing with a professional race car driver.
But the director killed their few and funny lines with Humpty-Dumpty off-beat editing, and the scriptwriter obviously did not care about anything but the main story lines and just employed a few stereotypic remarks from the great and unfunny book of one-liners to make it seem as if anyone but the set designers and the stuntmen had anything to do one this show...  No, please - I'm not done yet.
PvP is another means to drain you of yet another couple of hundred hours and dreadfully predictive unless you are a dimwit, reaching ne plus ultra meaning (take a wild guess) better equipment.
They didn't let Delta Burke use her own southern accent, and yet listen to Goodman, and he is anything unlike has ever been heard from a Santa.
Alas, poor Tim Conway had found a way to get onto yet another falling rock!
- better yet, how is these movies get so many stars to be in them???
Not far off from a talking heads movie, yet the conversations were slow enough that even if the movie involved gunfire they'd still be boring.
Meanwhile, we're treated to the most god-awful stereotypes of human beings: a whiny and neurotic single gal, Jersey girl snobs--with accents to match, a morose poet type, punk rockers, a cute but dumb bartender, two best friends (one of which always sleeps with the other's boyfriends--and yet they're still best friends), a handsome young man who has the curse of women falling all over him, and, worst of all, the wise and flawed Black person to offer commentary on all these white people.
Worse yet, a moronic fifteen year old.
The film is padded out, has terrible, wooden acting, a ludicrous script,awful zombie makeup, and yet somehow it doesn't fall flat on its face... well, not entirely.
I say, this is a cheesy yet in a way fun (yet also very boring) ATTEMPT at film-making.
I also find the scene in the other film, where the hunter kills Babar's mom, to be more powerful and interesting, even emotionally unsettling, than the stupid war in Babar the Movie, yet, it has an important point, is highly relevant, and is more appropriate an issue for kids.
HBO has yet again created another great show.
And yet she's presented to us as this major songwriter with her finger on the pulse of today's youth.
And worst yet, the basic story concept, of the internal conflict felt by a bright young woman who can write winning popular music, in an era still as stuffy as Mamie Eisenhower's tea parties ... was a most intriguing concept.
A handful of scenes work (particularly the moments between Muni and troubled youth Billy Dee Williams), yet the doctor's relationships with his eager-beaver nephew and stalwart wife are sadly artificial.
On a superficial level, I enjoyed this filmÂparticularly Diane Gaidry's portrayal of the sexually-repressed yet undeniably hot teacher, Simone.
*Watch out my review contains a spoiler, if you have not seen this movie yet, you may not want me to ruin it for you... if you want to find out what the ONLY funny scene in the movie is, read ahead*.
Tornatore shows his deep contempt for the ultra-Catholic, yet totally inhuman, NE of Italy.
I saw this piece of tripe and couldn't believe the mockery of a brilliant yet ruthless legend.
Henry was not a slasher film, it is human portrait, better yet a sort of cynical comment on films about real people.
Sure, I felt sorry for all of us knowing we would never be the same, but we were all unable to look away...yet no words were spoken.
This is yet another failed attempt at resurrecting the "creepy" horror movie which has disappeared from mainstream cinema.
So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs' first, in yet another time of violent transition.
watch this expecting a 0... and u will be pleasantly surprised with a 1 by the way... why hasn't the producer or the grips' mother written in the lead review yet?
If no-one yet knows she's a lady, down it.
More troubling was the way Hagman's character believed he was Holmes, yet he wasn't troubled by the fact that his friend Watson was now a female, nor that his flat at 221 B Baker Street was now in Los Angeles.
It was a surreal experience that is somewhat rewarding, yet it was a total head trip.
As with most films centered around black people,these days,the politics concerning blacks and white come into play.Blanche Baker plays her role as the manipulative sleezy news producer very well.Her character,Kate,mentions to Dexter that they,white woman and black men,together must work to keep the white man from keeping them from reaching the top.It is a horrid message from a trashy character and yet it is a message the film itself doesn't distance itself too far from.
So many characters, so much potential to explain them all and yet never happens.
And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone.
Better yet, actually READ the book, since apparently you did not if you think THIS movie is 'true' to the book.
The Cutter is yet,another terrible DTV Action film.
Sound of Horror - Haven't watched this one yet, but I believe it's about people dying in a cave in Greece.
Almodovar did this kind of Z-movie jokes decades ago because he started his career shooting those cheap yet energetic movies on his way to polishing his skills as a wonderful director with lovely stories to tell.
Or better yet, just hit yourself in the face with a cookie sheet for 92 minutes.
There's one guy in the otherwise all-girl band, and they make him sleep behind a sheet--out of modesty?--and yet the girls themselves are sexually active and think nothing of having sex in that van until the damn thing just about topples over.
The movie wants to have it both ways: be a modern look at streetwise teens and yet also be an old-fashioned musical.
The story is the biggest joke yet.
And don't forget this classic:  "We ain't found nothin' yet, not even a suspicious cowchip."
Yes, you've guessed right, this is yet another computer-animated film, filled with unnecessary morale and boring jokes.
And yet, despite all of this, Robots wins for the worst movie I have ever seen.
Robin Williams added no amusement, as he tried yet again to reproduce the genius he managed to possess in Aladdin.
I refer my Who question to Halle Berry's character who is top-billed and forced to be integral to the plot, yet only has about 4-5 lines throughout the whole movie.
Piak doesn't throw it further than a few feet yet when the camera changes its angle, all of a sudden the sword flies another 8 feet.
All of these reasons make Timeline an often hilarious yet ultimately dreadful viewing experience.
Anna Friel is yet another woefully miscast actress, who takes the role of French Lady Claire.
So besides this lack of believable technology, you have the "history plot"... English soldiers that start chasing 5 peasants in a crowd of like 500 peasants with this reason "Hey, why aren't you packing yet?".
And yet I find that this despicable little piece of slime :-) ISN'T AMONG THE BOTTOM 100!!!
Prepare yourself for some amateurish cinema, yet made with a lot of love and passion for the genre.
One brief mention of Project Ares, Lex's latest evil scheme, ensured the show contributed something to the end of season story arc, yet apart from that it was an episode that had no place in the last few episodes of this season.
Then you have yet to see "The Jewel of the Nile," that rare film that destroyed a reputation and a career.
Feeling tired yet?
I expected very little, yet was somehow still disappointed.
Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons, yet the word "radiation" never so much as passes anyone's lips.
I try to go into dumb yet potentially funny movies like this with an open mind.
So here I am, warning you who haven't seen this movie yet.
Better yet, why not wait for it on HBO?
So why did I hate this movie and yet took the trouble to review it?!
"Double Agent 73" is an amateurish and inept movie, yet there is an honesty about its amateurishness and ineptness: you get the feeling that the people involved didn't want to cheat you, they really did try to make an espionage / action movie, they just lacked the talent and budget required.
This movie seemed like it was written by someone who had seen too many "spring break" movies of the 80's, yet they wanted to do something "serious" -- no gratuitous sex/nudity, etc.
I am so privileged to have seen her on Broadway in "Lettice and Lovage," in which she was side-splittingly funny yet tugs at the heartstrings toward the end of the play.
Every time she tried to call anyone local over the windup telephone we had an 'amusing' interlude with the ineffectual local operator, and her rustic plug and wire switchboard, yet emails zip across the world to evil masterminds in seconds, complete with colour graphics and computery pinging noises.
This is a pretty odd movie that mixes drama with adventurous elements and yet somehow works.
The rest of the story was worse, as we watched the Cheetahs go through a lot of the first movie again, Galleria gets big headed and just wants to do Cheetah stuff all the time, and the girls have other interests to pursue, so finally Galleria gets mad and leaves, yet she comes back to them by a song.
Don't waste your time watching yet another Disney failure unless you have only half a brain and are under the age of 12.
Another thing I noticed right off was the fact that in the film, Jim's grandfather has no beard, yet in the book, Jim talks about his grandfather's long white beard.
The problem with this movie is not the worms per se, which apparently go on the attack because a power line is down (that happens all the time, and I have yet to see killer worms) it is the thoroughly unlikeable characters.
This is set in the south so everyone revs up the southern accent to intolerable levels (I live here and I have yet to hear anyone sound that southern) then there is Mic who is from New York.
More gore, more violence, more melodramatics, more of the Candyman yet everything else remains the same.
Typical sequel for a horror, yet there is much more blood and guts than an investigation.
With a lot of discussion about science, weapons, and peace the movie dances around the subject extensively yet never makes a coherent point about its position (regarding the nuclear arms race), as if simply inserting the theme is somehow sufficient.
It shows that African-Americans can be intelligent and purposeful in life and yet remain integral to black culture.
The premise/plot is a decent yet typical tale of revenge while the fight choreographing is superb.
Akitas are LOVELY dogs, and animal abuse is sick and gross; Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict, yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a couple--and given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first place--Maybe NOT such a good coupling; I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar (I frequented the real one, it looks nothing like that inside)for their avant garde status, they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes, chances are the servers are boho, too---THEY just take responsibility for their lives.
I rented this movie, since the awful (and yet still too kind) reviews kept me from wasting my $$$ at the theater.
They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine.
There are certain scenes painful in their laughableness, especially the death scene of a tender young thing who's fallen 6 stories, and yet appears not to have a scratch on her.
Sound scary yet?
His mom has bad hair and his sister can't dance, yet they wonder why he'd rather hang out with his dead grandpa!
you begin to realize this the movie has a wealth of increasing crappiness yet to vomit your way.
This is so horrible yet laughable at the same time.
We never learn about grandpa's powers, why he's unable to stop the family from eating bad food yet is able to hack a goblin with an axe through a mirror later and produce a Molotov cocktail to hurl at the Nilbog preacher.
Troll 2 - yet has no troll.
This is a simple sequence yet Herschell Gordon Lewis manages to drag it out for twenty minutes; there's no suspense concerning the opening of the parcel either and in it's place is a load of padding that sees the three characters involved babble on about rubbish that doesn't concern the plot anyway.
While doing yet another Dracula film isn't something we really needed, the story shows more originality than manner of the Hammer Dracula films!
Black and Forte are really the only cast members with legitimate acting experience (Forte had recently portrayed 'Pretty Boy' Floyd in 1970), yet their performances are just as lousy as everyone else's (like the script, perhaps they were simply confused as to how to proceed).
Were then treated to yet another 'lets tie the woman up and torment her' type of scenarios....we also have not so shocking 'could this be incest' moments when the lone man suddenly has a daughter type tagging along to help him in his deeds.
All of the guys were different, yet complimented one another.
I think, due to the fact that they are not famous-famous, yet.
The story is the same, almost word-by-word, yet the jokes don't work.
Here is yet another in a long, long line of Hollywood films in which all the black people are smarter than the stupid white folks, and all the politicians are corrupt.
Brad Johnson is the widower who is described as sweet and gentle, yet we can see from the get-go that he's overly-intense and a little dangerous.
the plot, such as it is, can be summarized in 3 lines, yet they drag it out to 2 hrs (with commercials).
The 1984 George C. Scott versions black robed figure of the ghost of things yet to come gives a chill no matter how many times I watch the movie.
It's a moment Stewart no doubt thought was clever, yet seems forced and unrealistic.
Especially the Ghost of Christmas yet to come.
This costuming of the Ghost of Christmas yet to come was an even stranger decision by the director than the heart-attack laugh of Patrick Stewart's Scrooge.
Lines are quoted literally from Dickens' novel and yet the actors often appear unconvincing and without the emotional commitment required to carry off some of the scenes.
Richard E. Grant was charmless and so was Tiny Tim; the Ghost of Christmas yet to come looked like a 7-foot-tall Jawa; and worst of all, I didn't care a fig about Stewart's Scrooge and whether he was redeemed or not.
Competing for popularity in her new school with Carla (Megan Fox), she stumbles through life in an almost-klutzy yet largely unfunny way.
I haven't gotten the soundtrack yet, but I want it really bad, mainly to hear this song.
You thought the girls from Clueless were superficial Oh u haven't seen anything yet.
The film stars the beautiful Lina Romay which is always sure to increase the watchability of any film; and we've also got a surprisingly decent performance from the man himself Jess Franco (under yet another moniker).
I suppose blame lies in the unenlightened viewing public and not in the quality of the film, as Scrapple is the most underrated film I have yet to see.
This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining.
He makes his films simple yet still entertaining.
However, this is probably his weakest film yet.
(r#31)  How can a movie be hyperactive, slick and flashy, yet boring, mind-numbing and comatose at the same time?
The action and stunts aren't even imaginative,.. seems like even money can't buy a good movie because even the fight scenes are uninspiring,..kind of reminds me of Steven Seagal movies where you're even hoping that the main character gets his ass kicked Characters: Ice Cube playing his usual badass self, although the release of this movie is in such close proximity to 'are we there yet?'
Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and X-Zibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3: Turkey Season.
At the start of the film, we're meant to believe that the heroes hate the police, yet it is never explained why they've bothered to become recruits.
Its great to look at but I have yet to determine why I should want to watch it.
OK so I decided to go too blockbuster the other day and get a movie, and remembered Black Dawn was a Seagal movie I had yet to see.
There's this really dumb twist at the end when some guy we have only seen once is revealed to be behind it or something yet for some reason he is there to start the bomb & kill the Russian terrorists, why not just let the Russians start the bomb & blow themselves up & like just make sure your out of Los Angeles well in advance?
Contrary to other views, I would argue that he totally pulled his weight and did exactly what his character was supposed to do, be menacing, vulnerable and the catalyst for action at a turning/breaking point in a deeply dull and empty marriage (frankly I would have turned gay had I been married to that dreary, needy woman)...I don't agree with anyone who thought that Gregory Christian delivered anything more than a lack lustre energy-less performance in a highly confusing, self-indulgent, yet ultimately predictable storyline for the genre.
The positive reviews are all written by people who have NEVER  reviewed any other movie (that is never ever a good sign) yet it has a high score?
yet of reviews there only 10% positive on the commentary board.
"No, I haven't yet.
If you've already seen it, I can't do anything about that, but if you haven't see the series first (and best yet skip the remakes).
The mask is really cool, very similar to the Michael Myers mask, yet unique in its own way.
It is uncomfortable watching a character who is so out of her depth, while the Nanny in the book grew up in that society, yet could still see the ridiculousness of it.
True the song "Ek Do Teen" is a foot-tabbing number & Madhuri Dixit shot to fame with this movie, yet what nobody seem to have noticed that it is a bad remake of Hollywood's action/ musical "Streets of Fire" (1984).
"Quite possibly" because I haven't seen all his early work yet.
Chuck Norris, stiff-as-usual, in yet another mind-numbingly predictable action thriller which actually has just as much talk as action, maybe even more.
With the exception of Contact, Hollywood's notion of what a scientist is has been so far from reality, yet Revelations has discovered a new extreme to take it to by contrasting it with a well-researched religious background.
But, the better, or the worst, is yet to come...
), and yet another relative (brother to Jupiter from the first film and, thus, Pluto's uncle), dubbed "The Reaper", and who appears out of nowhere.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home Â blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written.
This movie is yet another that has been poorly made by a fan of films, who cannot execute one properly.
The movie took place over a month yet they looked just as clean at the end of the movie than they did at the start of the movie.
George Tobias plays an ethnic in the manner of El Brendel, yet looking like Alfonso Bedoya in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.
And yet, a one dimensional voting system like this does not do justice to the complete ensemble of the TDICTE experience.
She lives for romance, yet picks the man who won't give it to her.
Since this movie came out in 1997, it has aired at least once a year, and I have yet to miss it.
Myles Jeffrey can't act yet, and his eye movements during times when other actors are feeding him lines are distracting.
It was a pathetic version of "chuckie", yet shorter.
I will say that Mimi does a wonderful job playing the pushover who hasn't come into her own yet.
An experienced cast of indie-film veterans (including Martin Donovan and Peter Fonda) and David Lynch in the executive-producer's chair does little to help what is, at heart, a stylish yet poorly calculated gloss on an ages-old premise.
The story is rather old yet this type of movie can still make for a good popcorn film.
Harrison Ford is over 60 years old yet he's still a better action star than some people in their 30s.
Borrowing from every film mentioned above, it uses elements from what worked and safely combines them in a coherent, yet unexciting manner.
I haven't yet seen the cover, but looking at it for 90 minutes would be infinitely preferable to having to sit through this loathsome tosh.
I've yet to see a silent film that makes it across the sound barrier.
Scorpions "get over here" is a pitiful remake (which also reminds me, Sub and Scorp are back, the two greatest characters ever, and yet they're midgets.
This film sucks Donkey Balls...and yet I know so much about it...oh the pain..
We who haven't left the room yet are saying "no", but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise.
And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here- I mean big, shiny, plasticy-looking "we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eye-strainingly obvious" effects.
Cudos to the filmmakers for including aspects like this which I'm sure most Canadians consider to be unsportsmanlike conduct, yet nonetheless part of the games that were played.
I know there are good screenplays out there being shelved...and yet we have this dog!
A severely deranged wacko psycho killer dressed in shiny skintight black leather and a motorcycle helmet brutally bags a bunch of beautiful young fashion models who all work for the same agency in this splendidly sleazy and notoriously nasty piece of typically twisted, yet stylish and polished low-grade Italian giallio murder mystery slasher thriller junk.
With such an original premise (well, compared to yet another monster movie) it's just sad to see such clichÃ©s.
its such a simple crappy movie, yet i had no idea what was going on.
Overall, FATAL PULSE is a late, yet woefully inept entry in the genre that has become nearly impossibly rare and to some, underrated.
(Spoiler Alert) actually just before the ending the fight with Mr. Psycho...it just didn't seem truthful, but I do like the fact that she took off and didn't get "saved" by her cute man and yet the emailing alludes to the possibility of them hooking up, even if at first he seemed creepy....so what I'm saying, rent it, but don't expect truthfulness to the situation...
The fact that this show, one of the most downbeat of all Broadway productions, was turned into yet another sweetsie-poo Hollywood confection (and of course moved from Chi, of which it reeks, to San Francisco, of which it doesn't) is yet another tragedy in the history of taking Broadway musicals to Hollywood, which, with the notable exception of "Oklahoma," just means that the show got butchered.
Set at beginning of summer break, yet the season is quite obviously fall.
So much good stuff going for it and yet so little of it actually adds up to a satisfying cinematic experience.
A huge group of 20-somethings stand around watching bazillions of bugs up close as they cover the windows, yet none shriek, barf, or any of the other normal expected reactions.
It's not yet a patch on Dario Argento, Sergio Martino or Mario Bava but we're definitely going into the right direction.
I can truly say this is the weakest and worst SH game yet in the series.
All three of us had high hopes for the series having been impressed by the adverts we had seen on TV however the first action scene which takes place behind a large mound was so comical all three of us couldn't help laughing, they where only getting shot at from one direction and where barely outnumbered and not even out gunned yet they are behaving like they are all about to die!
I haven't seen any of the other films yet, so I have to review this one in isolation.
1st watched 2/17/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mrs. Wallace Reid & Melville Shyer): Interesting yet slow moving movie displaying many taboo subjects for back then including pre-marital sex, smoking and drinking in high school, nude swimming, an abortion, and older men with younger under-aged women and all being done under the radar of the well-meaning parents in the story.
It chronicled the lives of deep, yet shallow-acting characters.
Clearly, he's not simply a hard-hearted man, yet he does despicable things like kick an innocent dog.
Secondly, the story is set entirely in France with all French characters, yet NO ONE speaks French!
The film is full of some fairly decent British actors Â Frank Finlay, Alan Bates, Tilda Swinton, Charlotte Rampling (the only French-speaking one, presumably) Â yet it comes over like a shoddy made-for-TV daytime movie.
That's used in a good way in this film - a whole load of solid, thought-provoking ideas are thrown in, yet Scott manages to make the film accessible - perhaps skipping over the science aspects of time-travel but crucially not disregarding them.
I didn't see the The Detonator yet, but I'm kind of scared to after seeing this movie.
I watched the first four episodes, because I wanted to like it, especially since Queer as Folk has yet to find a worthy replacement at the gay drama throne.
No time invested in developing any parts but the immediate family, yet time wasted in mentioning each star who ever crossed Natalie's path.
Yet I was also left to wonder how they could do this so many times in broad daylight and yet the cops STILL couldn't figure out who these young whippersnappers were!!!
We get convinced she loves desperately the painter, yet at the end of the movie she uses him only as an argument to persuade Jimmy on going to Paris.
He loved the Russian girl, yet in 5 days he forgot her and came to be deeply in love with Sylvia dressed as a boy?
Better yet, just skip the movie entirely and TELL people you've seen it.
If you haven't guessed yet, he is "the Terror of Tiny Town."
Admittedly the dialog and much of its delivery is B movie tedious, yet examining other scripts and performances of the time we find that this is rather standard fare.
That is never explained or developed, yet there was three hours to do it.
Denzel is his usual infinitely watchable self, Val Kilmer is quirky with yet another interesting dialect and Adam Goldberg is fantastic.
yet formulaic, love story?
The story is non-existent and the so-called gruesome violence is horrendously dull which makes this film experience extremely tedious... OK, these so-called killers are set up to be so psycho and inbred.. yet the girls keep their clothes on thru out the whole damn thing.. come on, were the two psychos gay??
The ending where they drive the truck off of the boat - in a stroke of divine intervention- they crash through all the immobile cars -with the distance they had - maximum they could be going 15 MPH - yet they plow through and manage to not only drive the truck OFF the ship, but get it way up in the air to flip around.
My last huge qualm about the movie is- when he heads towards the bayou at the end, he's in SUCH a hurry - yet - at the girl's house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry.
Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is how on earth Rachael would be physically able to commit these crimes because Mila Kunis doesn't look an inch taller than five foot , doesn't look an ounce heavier than ninety pounds and yet is able to commit acts of extreme violence with a sharp object .
But this doesn't stop other massive plot holes like the police not checking for DNA when the victim of a car crash is found at the end of the movie   AP2:AAG is yet another cynical attempt to sell a stupid movie as a " Black comedy " but this is done in an even more cynical manner since it's a serial killer screenplay marketed as the sequel to a totally unrelated movie .
Instead I was treated to yet another Cocknee Mocknee crime film, the same as all the others to be released in the last few years (except with even more silly running about, badly filmed gun fights and many many jokes from The Simpsons) Rarely have I found myself laughing so hard at not just bad acting/script/directing (take your pick) but also the preposterous presumption that this is what present day London was really like.
And yet there's something about the merger of nightmare and reality in "Night Wars" which gives it an odd, almost haunting quality which softens the edges of all its many faults.
If you didn't burst out in laughter yet, you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes.
None of the guests last through the night, yet a surprising abundance of folks happen to be cruising through the backwoods bayou late at night.
He spends the rest of the movie sulking, and yet, just in time to deliver the moral of the movie, Angel Buddy(tm) reappears and asks him if it was all worth it.
Seven years after her unexpected success with "My Big, Fat Greek Wedding", star Nia Vardalos looks slimmer and more glamorous than she did in her debut, yet she portrays almost the same self-defeating character as Georgia, a history professor who came to Greece to teach but ends up leading tourists around its ancient ruins.
Then these killers, generally speaking, develop a bond with these girls they abduct and do not kill while providing them everything so that they can break free and run, at times taking a hell of a beating at their hands yet doesn't kill.
So let me get this straight... Jason is in the woods for all of his life, killing tons of people; yet the cops have no idea that anything is going on.
This conclusion ranges RAW TALENT amongst other non-starry-eyed adult features like Chuck Vincent's ROOMMATES and Thomas Paine's CORPORATE ASSETS that have the guts to view the sex industry unromantically from the inside out, warts and all, yet thankfully without recourse to chest-beating Mea Culpa or the sickly sanctimonious approach the mainstream frequently adopts in covering same.
Even though 'The 9th Gate' was not the right adaptation from the 'El club Dumas', from the same author, Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte, it is a good film, making the fans of a good thriller eager for a much better work in what concerns 'LA TABLA DE FlANDES', stating yet that it's very easy not to drift from the book, while make a new movie...
Hoffman's character who continually played the devil's advocate to a clearly insane Joan, was just plain annoying, confusing, and yet another fabrication.
Williams goes into the woods to be trained in survival, yet for the amount of time he was there it was as if he was unable to learn anything.
The final scene culminated the film's strong reminder of the almost unpleasant yet intense fascination I often felt in the urban environments of Japan in the late 80's and early 90's.
If Bujalski had made this film 30 minutes shorter, or better yet, a 45 minute short feature, I might hold a very different opinion of it.
This isn't a rolling-in-the-aisles slapstick comedy and isn't intended as one, but the bureaucrats' combination of ruthlessness and obsessive yet oddly endearing personal dedication to their task, balanced by the businesspeople's often intricate and similarly humorous schemes to hang onto their property in the onslaught, is the exaggerated core conflict that pulls you into the plot and makes the film irresistibly charming.
The remaining group makes it to yet another house, where  the film's most infamous scene occurs.
Most men would never come close to treating their wife in that manner, yet he might just inordinately get his head bit off if he even approaches what might look like the impending doom of emerging expected bad behavior, as was truly seen by the husband in the movie.
He takes a generic, usually one note role; the haunted man, and imbues him with multiply layers of emotional depth (quakingly fearful yet strong, bravery in spite of moments of cowardice, morose but dryly humorous, fatalistic yet willing to act, haunted but yet still able to hope, etc) turning in a well rounded, excellent performance.
It gets boring when you see he's going nowhere and he succeeds again in alienating yet another woman who started out being understanding.
The computer in the railroad offices that runs the whole railroad is as big as the room, yet today, a laptop could probably run the railroad.
The action was supposed to be taking place in California, yet the police cars all have Connecticut plates.
But this one not only wasted the fifteen minutes I spent watching it, it's compelling me to waste yet more time writing this review.
However there were obviously no DVD's yet in 1982 and a TV special would perhaps had been too expensive and simplistic as a tribute.
Well, Peter sellers has died, yet this movie posthumously "stars" Peter Sellers.
There has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor one that creates any real suspense.
Maybe all this proves is that Hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore Bigfoot films, as they have yet to make one that works.
Playing almost at nude in the perimeter of one motel room and yet building complex and human characters is not an easy task for an actor.
It then tries to piece together the amensia of the main character through flashbacks, but these scenes never add up to any kind of plot/insight because yet again you don't know if the character is dreaming or if it really happened.
And yet again, since the character decides to keep dreaming the whole darn movie, the people that die are alive in the next scene.
I've loved all the Hellraiser movies, thus far, except III, which I've yet to see, but even this one wrenches my gut.
Sandler may be a decent actor someday, but he's not remotely there yet, and someone needs to tell him that -- otherwise, he'll continue to waste his time and our money.
At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.
I am not a Christian, yet I don't understand why it's considered offensive to make fun of other religions (and rightly so), yet acceptable to make fun of Christianity just for the sake of doing so.
This is one LOOOOONNNNGGGGGG and indulgent western, proof yet again that actors or singer/songwriters need to go to film school before spending someone elses millions.
"Nothing interesting is happening now," you think to yourself as the protagonist explains yet again what he wants his passenger to do, "but perhaps we will reach a dramatic moment at the end of the shot."
Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake.
He knew who was getting killed, and why, yet there were cops everywhere but outside that one spot.
The movie sells these peoples' suffering to us as entertainment, yet does not even show the respect of caring what really happened.
Sinister even by Whitechapel standards, the murder grabs the attention of Inspector Fred Abberline, a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his psychic abilities.
The perspective espoused here matches up nicely with the the view that many Indians hold of ABCDs: that all of them have forgotten their heritage and culture, that all the women are promiscuous, the men are conflicted yet also promiscuous, that all ABCDs hate their parents with a passion and seek to flout their moral standards at every opportunity, and that the women can be redeemed (temporarily at least)by having sex with a ridiculous, platitude-spouting FOB.
While I love Varley, his forte is short stories, some novels are moderate to great, but definitely not screenplays (although we don't know how tied his hands were and he only wrote one other screenplay - "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank", which I have not seen, but have read, yet another fantastic short story).
This is not only a bad movie, it is yet another scary symptom of a sick society being pandered to by an exploitive and irresponsible film industry.
The result is an unfinished painting, yet enough evidence is provided so that anyone with some imaginative sense can paint in the missing parts.
It was 1960, and the country had yet to experience true horror.
It had a darker than dark sense of humor, yet was done without any camp or irony.
Our heroes looking at African animals from the air with binoculars, yet when we are shown the "binocular" view, it's taken from ground level.
1940's airplane cockpits were incredibly cramped arrangements that were crammed with instruments, yet the cockpit shown here was massive, with not a dial, switch or gauge to be seen.
The most horrifying thing is that she is not dead yet, sitting upright in shock but then hopelessly shoved back inside by Leatherface, who has now killed her would-be rescuer.
He eventually tries to kill both of them, and gets stabbed by a warrior after he kills yet another of the tribesmen by 'accident'.
  Freddie Prinze Jr. serves up yet another 20-something romantic comedy.
Ryan grew up planning his whole life perfectly even though he was a geek through out high school, dated a fellow geek played by Alyson Hannigan and yet for some strange reason the most popular girl in his school Jennifer always seemed to be around him all the time.
There is hardly a drop of blood shown within the film, yet people will remember it in bucket-loads.
His humor is unique and genius - yet the cast doesn't deliver - Cathy Bates is terrible, Fairuza Balk is OK.
Clearly we are supposed to be on the side of the couple riding in Genevieve, and yet both of the couples are so intolerably immature and unlikable that it's impossible to care at all about who wins the race.
The two no doubt saw eye-to-eye on politics, ergo it is no surprise that they would both be involved in this movie, yet it was probably a bad idea for the Duke.
I think Hooper must have had some divine inspiration, because each of Leatherface's scenes is exquisitely planned and executed, from the first guy who gets dragged down, to Pam, to the encounter with Franklin and Sally in the woods (how chilling and scary was that, and yet how clever, to chase someone in the woods equipped with...a chainsaw) to the end.
Are you bored yet?
That the film is so unrelentingly dark and so unbelievably sadistic in its second half, and yet fascinates even as it traumatises, is a definite testimony to the skill of its director.
As a mirror of a dark period in American history, Chain Saw remains one of the best evocations yet of the era, as a group of young individuals, returning to the nostalgic home of their childhood, stumble into the raw and irrational cruelty of the modern world.
Virtually every other Carpenter film has simple yet memorable music that matches the mood of the movie perfectly but not this one.
I've just watched the film and yet I couldn't hum a note of the theme, if it had one.
Lowest point is her scene in the dentist chair, getting her teeth drilled in what may be an unofficial--yet totally unfunny--nod to "Marathon Man".
Are we supposed to enjoy a film where the anti-hero betrays his kindly commanding officer, sleeps with his wife, sleeps with a teenager, deals heroin on the side, consorts with Turkish gangsters, sells stolen weapons to said gangsters yet comes up the good guy?
This clown you couldn't, yet we were supposed to root for him and jeer the hard nosed sergeant sent in to bust him?
Daughter Carrie is approaching puberty and yet refuses to behave like a girl, wearing her father's dogtags and jeans, running instead with a group of boys including her younger brother and two other lads.
At one point in the film Julie's landlady is found dead yet nothing ever comes from this.
"Frankenfish" is still the best Sci-Fi movie yet, IMHO.
And if you think the conversations are bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The battle action was the best yet seen, though not on the same graphic level that we can expect today.
All this...i could easily forget it...but what destroyed me completely...was the "Disco Battle"(Final Fight Between the Old Ones and the Raider)or the Final Fight Between Will and the Raider( The effects of the Light and Dark Energies looked so crappy, a White and Dark Blankets, would have worked better) ************************************ So, Ill give it a 3, because it was not the worst movie i have seen yet...but because of the many plot holes and ...why to put Maggie and Stephen on the promotional poster if they barely acted on the film?
Screenwriter John Hodge must take much of the blame for his insipid and amateurish screenplay, yet his track record - including the excellently- written "Shallow Grave" and "Trainspotting" - makes me wonder if he contrived this disaster all himself, or if he was under pressure from director Cunningham (whose own resume might have led one to predict that he would make something like this) to dumb everything down for the benefit of some imaginary audience of American teenagers with single-digit IQs.
The special effects are clichÃ©, more distracting than dramatic, and the battles turn into yet another CGI super-hero cartoon scene.
Announcing at the same time that he changed the script from younger British boy to older American boy to avoid having yet another Harry... Well, Susan Cooper's book series the Rising of the Dark sequence was written long before Harry Potter and it has all the material for a good movie.
There's a 25-foot-long crocodile running amok and yet this movie mainly criticizes how the Western world shamelessly turned its back on the poverty & civil war issues in Burundi.
But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash.
Ladies-man Sinatra does a lot of sweetheart-talking and forehead kissing, yet his randy excursions (and drunken escapades) are merely chatted about, never seen.
The screen I was in was full of the key demographic for this movie, and yet nobody laughed.
Rutger proves yet again that he is if anything, utterly incapable of picking a real role.
This belated attempt at a Western adventure is a curious anomaly: the script is, on the one hand, terribly old-fashioned and clichÃ©-ridden and yet equally replete with such 'modern' elements as four-letter words and bouts of violence.
There are so many ideas yet they all just loosely connect together.
The plot is simply and yet highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25.
She reminded me of the people who accost you on buses asking you if you've found Jesus yet.
It leaves one with a vague feeling of religious unease and a sense of the demonic gnawing monotonously away at Christian tradition; yet another rusty nail in the resurrected Body of Christ.
The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side.
In fact, I would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that I have yet seen and, believe me, I have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e.
This is supposed to be a werewolf movie, yet there's hardly any werewolf action.
Even an all-star cast of such legends as Sir John Gielgud, Helena Bonham-Carter, Rutger Hauer, and Isabella Rosellini couldn't save Merlin from becoming yet another casualty of the TV junkpile (`Journey To The Center of the Earth' should ring a bell).
And yet for 99 minutes this is dragged out.
It is apparent that Andrews and Crawford are having a sexual relationship, yet Joan doesn't act like a fallen woman; she strides about during an argument, cleaning up her apartment defensively until Dana takes her in his arms (where she melts, like a pushover).
I wanted this movie to end so badly, yet it was like watching a car accident.
This automatically leads to the next question: How did the killer know the blonde woman at the apartment (who is seemingly raped in a very long and tedious scene) was going to the audition and how did the killer got hold of that creepy mask, which was a prop stashed away at the mansion, a place where the killer hasn't been to yet?
VHS tapes of CURTAINS (which is not available on DVD yet) often go for a good price on eBay.
It seems that no film yet portraying the South African accent has got it right.
The audience is geered to feel empathy for these mothers who are forced to relinquish custody of their babies- yet despite a few initial protests, Rose does nothing to challenge the dictatorial Mother Superior or change any of her dictums even after she herself becomes a mother!
I'm glad I have come to my senses but I do think that this movie is worth renting for those who haven't done so yet.
Those girls could not sing at all but yet,managed to squeak into the bottom American top 40 with,"Kiss In The Dark".
Johnny doesn't like the reverend, yet the character is neither written nor performed as a standard villain.
In short, the first half of the movie does not get your hopes up too high, yet the latter half is disappointing.
The ending is not finished yet, which make me hate this film.
The only thing that's partially recyclable are scattered scenes with Micro's neighbor played by (the one and only) Lawrence Tierney, a crusty yet likable old codger who tosses such pearls as "Get a job", "Don't do drugs" and "Buy new shoes".
De Niro gives us the most impressive Frankenstein's creature we have seen yet, even better than the Boris Karloff performance from the original.
Gary Daniels stars as Kenshiro a banished warrior who takes on Lord Shin (Costas Mandylor) to avenge his father's death and reclaim his bride in this visually appealing yet terrible actioner.
I actually liked it during the first couple of minutes during the time, when the main character, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) hadn't opened his mouth yet, but after he spoke and revealed, that besides the looks he hadn't slightest bit of acting talent I quickly stopped liking it.
The violent content probably would preclude younger viewers from seeing it and yet they would possibly be the only ones able to appreciate the simplicity of the plot.
The audio levels varied wildly (in one scene where a telephone is ringing, the sound effect is almost deafening, yet the music was almost inaudible throughout the movie).
Behind it all is Sidney Lumet, a once-talented director who has helmed a few masterpieces in his time; however, whatever muses guided him towards those masterpieces has, in the last decade or two, abandoned him, for here he is again, delivering yet another celluloid stillborn.
It is a dated film about a culture that doesn't exist everywhere, yet oddly the DVD does.
The burnished cinematography by Peter Biziou and fine supporting performances from Colin Firth (in his debut) and Cary Elwes do help, yet I found this picture extremely cold and rather indifferently-made.
They have been living together for five years, and both say they've been uncommonly happy, and yet they know little about each other.
He is very intelligent, yet imperfect.
man animals as they call us) is weak and stupid and can't mine or do anything constructive, yet there is still the evidence of everything man built after the invasion.
Frequently, John Travoltas character (Terl) constantly refers to Forest Whittakers character as being stupid, yet its Terl that makes all the daft choices that enable the hero to succeed!
We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years, yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals.
We are lead to believe that she was raised in this small California coastal town yet her thick accent begs to differ.
I have yet to see the American remake of the film, so I cannot compare the two, but I can easily say that I found this to be one of the most effective psychological horror films I've had the pleasure of seeing.
She plays her standard semi-bimbo, semi-slick and yet semi-alluring chick with little substance and not much thought it seems for how her dialogue progresses -- DOA and the Presidio some to mind.
The movie manages to be as slow as a snail, yet impossible to figure out whats going on.
Secondly, the film is strong, yet subtle in its ridiculing of the Japanese that many people don't even realize what their brain is absorbing.
Although many people in today's society may roll their eyes at yet another attack of political correctness, it is essential to note that films, in both the past and present, shape people's perceptions of the world.
(Strangely, Jeff and Cynthia are married, yet they are also forced to sleep apart.)
The subject is well known in the American horror genre: young, innocent people meet old, frustrated yet colorful country folk.
Another major problem is the film's villains, the weakest yet.
First of all Maria Conchita Alonso is a famous for just being famous, but she is NOT a good actress or worst yet she is not an actress And I don't get Kuno Becker I never liked him when he used to do telenovelas and I don't like him now, he's not handsome or talented or nothing at all.
I am willing to bet however the UK version is way better, but I have not yet seen it.
If you have not yet experienced the crappiness that is the Manitou - save yourself - and rent anything else.
And yet I had to watch it to it's finish.
This horrendous, yet compulsively watchable, film has a plethora of classic bad movie moments.
A few highlights include: Curtis gyrating around to canned disco music as he pours himself a beer into a wine goblet, Stevens attempting to keep a straight face in the light of her ludicrous role (she eventually exits the film altogether without explanation), Sothern's home being trashed, yet her false eyelashes never move a tad (she barely registers in this film at all, a person would have to hit "pause" to get a decent look at her!
This is a very early Our Gang comedy, yet oddly when the film begins it says it stars James Finlayson and Charley Chase.
In addition, the actor who played Lemmon's son was such a vile little creep that we actually hoped someone would run him over, yet we were supposed to care that his dad never gave him enough personal attention.
vampirism Â and, yet, it has rarely been dealt with such a visceral (and frankly off-putting) approach.
By boring I do not simply mean slow-paced, as I have enjoyed movies that are remarkably slow-paced, yet keep the viewer's interest.
For those who loved this movie, you have a right to your opinion, but I have yet to see a positive review that makes a reasonable case for it.
In the "Final Destination" films all the deaths were made to look like freak accidents yet you always knew that they weren't just accidents but that something supernatural was at work.
I haven't even seen the next episodes yet but this could hardly be more clear.
I have yet to see the first Ginger snap or any other Ginger snaps movies in the series.
Carina Lau has some shining moments, yet with an emotionless(trying to be sophisticated?
Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films.
The worst is a bit later when Clark is caught committing another crime and Bellamy could have just let the police take her away--yet he vouches for her and prevents her arrest!!
The likes of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are worshipped by millions, yet I honestly cannot detect any signs of acting prowess or versatility.
It also deals with husband and wife issues (1985) also get Dilse if you have not yet.
The last thing you expect from a low-budget 80's horror film with the word 'demon' in its title is complexity and confusion, and yet all you get from "Dream Demon" is complexity and confusion.
To summarize: if you want to see a bad, yet somewhat entertaining movie, watch Biodome.
As he looks into who is sending him the packages, he discovers one neighbor is stockpiling cola and making internet "cybersmut" films through virtual reality programming, another neighbor has been using the smut program on a regular basis and is stockpiling juice, and yet another neighbor is stockpiling meat.
I've seen any number of films he stars in and I've yet to see why or how the guy made so many films, especially late in his career.
No one accepts these tickets because...well, if they did, the filmmakers wouldn't be able to show us the various ways these people get tortured and killed by assassain Steve (have they made a movie without me yet?)
Let's go through our checklist of horror movie clichÃ©s: 1) Stock characters - check 2) Characters with seedy pasts that you know will come into play - check 3) A cop who has no clue what he's doing - check 4) A creepy janitor who knows the whole history - check 5) A supernatural killer - check  Yep...basically this is just yet another horror flick that will be easily forgotten an hour after watching it.
A huge group of 20-somethings stand around watching bazillions of bugs up close as they cover the windows, yet none shriek, barf, or any of the other normal expected reactions.
If you haven't seen this whole trilogy yet, you definitely should.
Horror sequences are predictable yet utterly stupid.
If men were bred out of life, there might be a chance for a future but that isn't yet possible.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't.
There is some ribald sense of humor to spice things up, yet not enough to bring characters into life.
Billy Zane, Billy Zane, Billy Zane what can i say, you do have Kelly Brook but yet since this has happened Jason Stathams career has gone higher and higher and i don't think you can go any lower.
Have I mentioned the cartoon like aspect to the writing yet?
The sad ending of That was Then,This is Now is why the book is so popular and yet they replace it with a happy ending.
It's hard to fathom it, but Martin was once a pretty decent actor, yet everything at this point was slipping: his talent, his looks, his focus, his patience.
Part of it is the cheapness of the film itself, such as the scene where he slides on a rail, the obvious dummy falling off the roof or the poor use of stunt doubles or the obvious wires suspending the woman near the end of the movie--they're so obviously bad yet no one seemed to care.
Tatiana Maslany is brilliant as Ghost, she played the creepy psycho very well yet she still managed to be quite likable, she was also energetic had some good lines, had a wicked character, and was totally unpredictable, I predict big things for this young actress!.
Eric Johnson is great as Tyler he was a bit of an ass and very cocky, but somehow yet still charming and quite likable I dug him for some reason, he did a good job.
One thing I'm quite surprised I haven't commented on- I was very bummed by the amount of the Master of Ceremonies bits they took out... the Emcee was one of my very favorite characters in the play, and yet his part was so much smaller in the movie...
And yet it's a B picture from beginning to end.
Turns out Uncle Bumps is really a hard-drinking, free-wheeling bachelor who dislikes children--yet he is so taken with this uptight artist once he meets her, he attempts to woo her under an alias.
He is saved by, of course, Quaid (dad) in a not-so-emotional scene where his dad yet again promises to be there for him in the future.
The only revelation this movie provides is this: Hollywood has your money and time yet again!
And yet "Cabaret" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and Â especially Â the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII.
See it for yourself... no, better yet; take my word for it... it's horrible.
The idiocy of this storyline has yet to find an equal.
This underrated director brought us such horror favorites as "Fright Night" and "child's Play" and yet I feel he's never been given due credit.
Andy soon find out that chucky is back and up to no good, of course he tell in his forester parents that doll is alive, yet again now one believes him, There some deaths scene that not gory and not even little bit scary and two of death scene are off-screen.
Everything about this movie is so boring and deaths scene could not even save movie, I would say this is the Worst Child's play movie in the series I would say fast forward to last 7 minutes of movie, as it the only worth watching part of movie to see chucky getting killed off yet again.
A person gets killed on screen and there's no tragedy, but yet everyone gets upset and mourns when someone dies in real life.
I'm quite sure more sequels have yet to come...
Totally pointless and exceedingly boring low-budget sequel to the surprisingly popular and yet, disappointing first film that starts off promisingly enough as it shows in black and white a young deformed boy being tortured by a group of teenage thugs that call themselves "The Blood Wings"...or something similar to that.
Is it soup yet?
This film is packaged as a psychological thriller, yet it has no thrills and the depths of the psychology used in the writing are that of a small child's capacity.
I left the theater feeling that I had been brutally robbed of my dollar, and worse yet, that I had lost a portion of my life (the time I took to watch the thing) that I would never be able to recover.
"Cabaret" boasted big songs, big ideas, and big actors Â yet it felt long, dull, and convoluted to say the least.
His portrayal, as small as it was, as the infamous Master of Ceremonies has yet to be repeated in any film to date.
Joel Grey brought it to the table, and will forever be a frightening, yet influential image in my mind.
Her flat voice matched well with her disassociated character, which carried no emotion, flaunted no values, yet tried to win our heart.
For "Cabaret" to work, there needed stronger characters for us to follow Â ones that were defined, yet complex, not just jumping from emotion to emotion.
If you are a fan of the original Highlander (a great movie in my opinion), and for some reason haven't seen this yet, for pity's sake, don't!
If we both stick our hands into a puddle of orange, shiny goo, we'll be shocked, and yet, united.
Story number three is the mild best of the bunch, with a message service operator (Marg Helgenberger) being menaced by pathetic yet undeniably dangerous loony (Alan Rosenberg, Helgenberger's real-life husband).
It gives you this sort of "I-know-what-will-be-in-the-end" feeling you have when you see newspapers and videos made years ago - yet it reveals some sides you didn't know about.
Summarized, this could have been nice as a short movie (30 minutes at max) that shows the story as it is: somewhat tragic, yet uncomplicated.
Well by now I have really gotten over it.It doesn't matter anymore because the film works so well without the other songs,I feel it has everything essential from the stage version,which I have never even seen btw,yet anyway.
Not finished yet.
There's not a single verbal reference to Hitler, and yet the presence of the growing Nazi movement all around these decadent misfits is ever present in this film.
The musical number "Tomorrow Belongs To Me" is so effective an illustration of the appeal this new Nazi hope held for impoverished suffering Germans, and yet we have The Master Of Ceremonies' evil nodding grin to remind us, in retrospect, what it really led to.Just as every musical number (aside from being so beautifully choreographed and presented) reminds us of the desperation in Sally Bowles' life and in most of Germany.
Guest: because you are not funny, and never have been, yet you insist on telling people you are hilarious and that "The Mask 2" was not this generation's "Ishtar".
Or better yet, just concentrate on Sybil.
So these guys are GOING to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the Bulls or the White Sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put ESPN to shame.
They wind up IN THE GHETTO, yet their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY.
There are 3 stories, one involves a lunatic killer, the other a haunted Indian/weed pipe and the last one is yet another killer story.
We have a whole series of similar false endings here where you think the mystery has been cleared up then BANG Mr Ward decides an already over cluttered screenplay isn't complicated enough so he adds yet another plot twist which makes the story more and more ridiculous as it trundles along   Merlin I hope you make a success of your career but remember one thing - Less is more
Conan Doyle ends the story with Holmes demonstrating a better approach to good international relationships, in a memorable comment suggesting that one day the memories of the idiots who caused the American Revolution will fade and Britain and the U.S. may yet be reunited again.
Totally devoid of ANY new or creative ideas with respect to what we have seen from him before, Kaurismaki's feature recycles his lately trademark - and otherwise very appealing - darkish, yet basically cheerful coloured backgrounds and surroundings behind and around the actors.
I appreciate when some movies wait to fully explain things in the end, but this movie makes one feel like an explanation is coming at some point -- yet it never comes.
Roger Corman's "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1960) was filmed in under five days with the teensiest of budgets, yet it is a very funny, consistently entertaining little gem of a movie.
At first, you're just searching for an untraceable method to get rid of one corpse you accidentally got stuck with, yet before you know it, you're mangling people especially to generate more tasty cat food.
Two loonies supposedly operate the factory, yet they provide a nation-wide stock of cat food supplies?
It's only 72 minutes long, yet Mikels succeeded in making his film quite boring and overlong.
Directed by Ted V. Mikels and co-written by Arch Hall Jr. Get the hint yet?
In his other works, King is good at occasionally creating scary moments, some even filled with prolonged dread; yet what makes his novels readable and other television projects such as "Rose Red" watchable when wading through the banal characters, plot points and scenes, is here lacking, which is strange.
Gone as well are the often comic and/or obsessive, yet believably human characters which were the backbone of the original series by Lars Von Trier.
'Ik ook van Jou' was crap as well, so why go for yet another one?
The entire city has been evacuated and is now occupied by indestructible robots who kill people and repulse the military with unknown rays -- yet they'll be watching every street corner for some nobody who killed a hooker!
No one but Howard Hughes could have produced a sexest, yet tongue in cheek, film like "Son Of Sinbad".
The female lead has a twisted ankle, yet the director isn't concerned about that.
This is NOT a good movie, yet I can't call it totally un-enjoyable.
A tremendously talented actor, Schreiber has not yet achieved the acclaim he so richly deserves, languishing too often in forgettable films like `Kate and Leopold' and `A Walk On the Moon,' though he was perfectly cast as Orson Welles in the made-for-TV film, `RKO 281,' in which he was brilliant.
I whole heartedly will you to see it, even if you have not yet view the first one.
The Great Outdoors is yet another "disaster-vacation" comedy along similar lines to every other movie within its limited and predictable genre (e.g.
During the race the car had pressed steel wheels most of the time, yet occasional shots showed wire wheels again.
Unfortunately I've yet to see a documentary that covers the history of the conflict and the various negotiations from a Palestinian perspective in detail.
He had not yet grown into that lovable Little Tramp.
Not by any means good (except when borrowing British whodunits) but so much better than this purposeless, offensive yet somewhat strangely impossible-to-make-compelling farce.
It's ironic: his character was a total pig, yet there's something very engaging about the actor that makes you warm to him.
Scratching your head yet?
Did it ring a bell yet?
She is at once obnoxious, brash, funny and fun...and yet, very vulnerable, struggling so hard to be recognized and very terrified of where her life is headed.
He is the son of Bhushan from Buiniyaad , yet another historical typecast fellow.
Movie stars make me sick, they could help so many people and do so much good with their money, yet most of them can think of nothing to use it for except for drugs, booze, and partying!
BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned   Here too the story sounds 2000 years old  Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous  I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so  About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing  The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk  Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated  Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
I mean, the movie was made in such modern style yet that same old ghissi pitti story ?
Let's just mention a few of the more glaring plot gaffsÂ  Daniel has supposedly suffered some type of serious head injury in the past and yet he plays lacrosse for an entire season on a team that's never won a game to improve his `coaching' credentials?
Not dirty in your sexual or violent way but for the fact that a film could be this bad, and yet still make it on to TV screens.
They were dark, they were even scary at times, yet it was charming and enjoyable by even the most discriminatory comic book and manga goers.
Or even yet, look for the original graphic novels (not the awful Archie comics version though).
The Seasons were (in order), Borneo, Australian Outback, Africa, Marquesas, Thailand, Amazon, Pearl Islands, All-Stars, Vanuatu, Palau, Guatemala, Panama, Cook Islands, Fiji, China, Micronesia, Gabon, Tocantins, Samoa (didn't air yet) The winner were (in order), Richard Hatch, Tina Wesson, Ethan Zohn, Vecepia Towerly, Brian Heidik, Jenna Morasca, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Amber Brkich, Chris Daughtery, Tom Westman, Danni Boatwright, Aras (something), Yul Kwon, Earl Cole, Todd Zherog, Parvati Shallow, Bob Crowley, J.T.
I cannot in good conscience recommend the TV version as much as I would the 1964 movie version or better yet - the book, but I feel the TV version did score one home run ... it made people aware of this little gem .
And here we have yet another movie which romanticises that, just like this years effort "The Quiet American" and countless others where asian women find love in the arms of some token white guy.
There are moments in this film that are perfectly set up for satire yet the scenes are played straight, effectively "dumbing down" the movie.
Some voice, same hands, same face, same eyes but yet nobody recognizes Mr. Hyde as Dr. Jekyll.
Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Louis Burke a mounty who goes undercover in a hardcore prison to investigate why people are dying behind bars, and finds out in the process that the cover-up involves the guards who are harvesting organs in this dumb yet mildly diverting prison pic.
Come on guys, if you call THIS good then you haven't seen nothing yet.
Further more it seems stupid that the movie begins with a strange story about a nuclear bomb, when that hadn't even been invented yet at Dorian Gray's time.
Are you a StarGate fan who hasn't seen this episode yet?
(i.e Crumb) When Daniel Jackson instead went to deliver an idiotic moralistic speech following Vala's come-on I was overwhelmed with shock just how bad this bit was and that the production staff previewed this yet still allowed it to air.
It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.
And yet Milius went on to be a screen writer for the movie apocalypse now.
Heard here is smug and charmless, yet we are supposed to be impressed by him because he's played by the great John Heard.
Having scary hungry mutants populate the sewer is simple yet scary.
wow - if there was ever a "message movie," this has the most ridiculous caricatures of Christians I've seen yet from Hollywood - the font of Christian bashing.
Hilary Swank is a great actress yet she couldn't even save this film.
DJ Qualls, Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood and Glenn Morshower are all good actors yet they all together could not save The Core.
But the spin begins long before they take the plungeÂ   At a militia symposium, geophysicist Aaron Eckhart (your average "biscuit-thrower" college professor: disheveled hair, attire and lifestyle; upon arriving home, throws biscuit to dog which has no name Â Hollywood stereotype created by Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon"), cites Physics 101, yet none of the generals seem to have even a sixth-grade education, as they stare dismayed at his demo of burning a peach with a spray-can, to illustrate Â get this!
Katharine Isabelle makes some small but yet effective glimpses and adds in with some voice-overs.
I haven't read the book yet, and this is the only version of the novel that I have seen.
The plot is supposedly based on true events, yet so much in this movie smells of phoniness.
Better yet, avoid ALL movies associated with Michael Moore.
Lo Bianco and Stoler argue constantly, yet we can't see why he is so devoted to her (or why he changed his course of action for her in the first place).
"Double Team" is a ridiculous action-fest the likes of which have yet to successfully transition into mainstream American films.
Instead of casting the story's eerie spell, Huston's film-making suffocates the material, causing it to become overblown yet underdeveloped.
That's a Gordian knot I haven't been able to untie yet...  A true and newly born German entertainment cinema is certainly about to appear on the spotlight - but DER CLOWN dosen't belong to it (... at least, that is what I hope!)
This can't hold a candle to the original & it's going right back to the store I bought it from to be traded yet again.
If you like the material, remade infinitely better by Howard Hawks as HIS GIRL Friday (1940), better but not brilliant by Billy Wilder as THE FRONT PAGE (1974) and yet again as SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988) with Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve.
One should be revolted yet one isn't; it's all good fun, if not quite in the way it was intended.
a fitting end to a funny yet dramatic trilogy.
nowhere is the least serious of the three, and yet the ending was saddening.
Or better yet, since I had to buy 3 tickets, I'd have rented it on DVD and been able to pause it to use the bathroom, because the treacles sweetness made my tummy queasy.
The script hits every clichÃ© in the book, from ugly duckling turned into tousled-blonde It Girl, to crackers psychiatrist who turns out not to know anything about his subject, to the lolita in a swimsuit (with amazing lack of support) jiggling in the surf in slow motion, to the string of young punk suitors, to the Recapturing of Youth scene -- complete with candy-red Jag yet -- to the final scene of the younger daughter replicating the same behavior as the wayward lass.
Nowhere is a mean-spirited, yet trippy look into the lives of confused, drug-addicted over-sexed L.A. teenagers.
He is saved by, of course, Quaid (dad) in a not-so-emotional scene where his dad yet again promises to be there for him in the future.
The only revelation this movie provides is this: Hollywood has your money and time yet again!
Some people may say that it has no plot yet I disagree.
The film consists of a day in life of teenagers facing everyday problems yet with a quirky depiction.
Gregg Araki brings us yet another fairy tale of doom in this epic.
All of the women in the show seem very nurturing and kind, yet brainwashed by Brian.
The musical numbers were nice and the voice talent was top-notch, yet there was no there there.
And yet somehow, despite most odds, Araki actually manages to construct a film around interesting, affectionate characters, and then pit them in an environment of illicite sex and drugs, disillusionment and disaffection, all while maintaining a level of pathos that (for the most part) is genuine.
However, if you're not sick of Michael Cera's awkwardness yet, then it's used perfectly here.
There was no reason for this film and I think that Almereyda was really grabbing and hoping that he would uncover something, yet he never did.
If you are even a modest fan of pop culture history, you will notice horrible gaffs all over this thing (The Ideal Toy Company segment of the movie, wherein toys not yet available until the end of the 70's are on display in 1971), the ages of his children in the 60's sequences, all kinds of dopey crap.
The fact that Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning are courting but not yet married would suggest that the action takes place around 1845.
36 Chinatown weaves the tale of a missing child, his murdered mother, two gold digging teenyboppers, a handsome playboy and two other couples in circles around one another as drawn by a police inspector (Akshaye Khanna in one of his most dashing and sinful hot roles yet).
He dresses, acts and lives like a loser and yet--unlike her colleagues who are rightfully wary of him--she becomes involved with him.
I desperately try to not watch one single David DeCoteau movie every year, yet for some reason I always seem to end up watching one of them every single year.
First a Grizzly as large as the one in this film would need a large hunting ground but yet seemed to be in a fairly small one around a blocked of toxic waste dump and has never been noticed by anyone .
"Schoolgirls in Chains", with its grotesquely provocative yet inaccurate title, may perhaps thrive on a series of ultimately controversial, shocking and politically incorrect themes, but the low-budget elaboration and lack of talent involved (fortunately?)
After each effort at generating laughs, there seems to be an uncomfortable silence as the audience consistently remains silent, or worse yet, sighs at this unbelievably unfunny movie.
Or better yet, don't have a specific 'funny' man, but let everyone be humorous on their own in different ways (Such as Monsters Inc.).
Over and over, this show has repeatedly tried very hard to promote interracial relationships even though they are statistically rare (about 3%) yet oddly enough - they never address the racial component of a relationship.
A simplistic, yet highly entertaining comedy starring Richard Pryor.
Doesn't make any sense yet?
Better yet, watch a BLONDIE flick instead.
He just seemed like a boorish jerk--yet she fell for him.
Director Irwin Winkler started out as an accomplished producer, and bore that credit on many good films (Raging Bull and Rocky among them), but he has yet to direct a good film, after many tries (The Net, At First Sight, De-Lovely, Life as a House).
-Ah, but then the fun begins again, and they forget about their troubles and make fun of Leo Getz again and the saxophone plays again,and the mood is :)...and then Riggs is a "son of a bitch" again, and Murtaugh in insensitive not to take Riggs in account when he decides to retire for yet another time...?!?
Worse yet, rarely very suspenseful, although some viewers will doubtless be on edge of seats waiting for the annoying heroine to get her come-uppance.
I mean he's great in pretty much everything (barring "Proof of Life) and yet I never see him get any accolades.
And in the end, it'll just feel like you've wasted yet another 90 minutes of your precious life.
That's the thing, this is a movie that takes place in Beijing, a city of millions, yet where are the people?
Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet and want to be surprised.
The synopsis for the film compares The Night Before to Scorcese's After Hours, which, for those who haven't yet seen it, is about a guy who gets lost somewhere in New York, and every time he tries to find his way back home, he gets involved in some awful situation with a bunch of complete wierdos.
This is not aided by the gratingly winsome yet flaccid performance by Miou-Miou, who does not thrive in this kind of role - there is really nothing to play here.
This same quality can be said about this adaptation of yet another one of his works for the theater.
But volcanoes are one of my most favorite movie genres, and wild dead horses couldn't drag me away from watching one i haven't seen yet.
These are universally recognizable young people - they rebel against and yet feel tied to their families and regretfully break ties with old friends; they fight with their siblings but bail them out; they get lonely, a bit homesick, and bored; they are jealous and ambitious; and they constantly compromise, particularly the women bargaining with the oldest currency.
Such was the question occurring to me as I struggled through yet another disastrously ridiculous SciFi Channel disaster movie.
The only advise I can give anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet is: try READING THE BOOK because this movie is awful!  
It's a subtle, delicate, yet powerful film with a directing style that can best described as artfully unobtrusive.
At the time of this writing, it had not been released yet in the theaters here.
Also Wtf is with the mine scene that was SO bad they some would have died and your going to jail for ever anyways you terrorists just kill someone seriously toy soldiers is Way better and they would of killed the cops when they shot like 1000 bullets and them like what the shiz what are the cops doing just charging thats so stupid i would just kill the children I'm not even and the terrible sewer scene yet that I've herd so much about.
And that's another thing -- it's geared towards kids, and yet I'm not sure this is a movie I'd show to kids.
The lead character is a murderer and yet I felt sympathy for her.
That wouldn't have hurt all too much had these scenes been directed capably, yet Bay demonstrates an inept ability to create an entertaining action piece.
Here he spurts out each line like a child in a school play, relieved that he has managed to get yet another memorised line out of the way.
Purportedly they are things Ricky remember--yet they're all things that happened to his brother which Ricky has no way of knowing!
However, the best part of the movie has yet to be mentioned.
Blackport gives a decent acting performance, though not of the caliber of other great "thriller" actresses such as Jodie Foster and Laura Linney, and yet the movie was quite compelling and intense.
The story that unfolds afterwards is preposterous, soapy, twisted, quasi-operatic and yet fitting, for a story about Hollywood.
In fact, he has never in his life fired a gun in anger, yet has somehow fostered total law, order and respect among the townsfolk.
The son couldn't look after his younger brother yet could get himself from Australia to England alone.
I have never yet fallen asleep in the cinema, but this time it was a close-run thing, and judging by the lack of animation from my fellow cinema-goers I wasn't alone in this.
First off, let me admit, I am yet to play FFVII (I intend to order it soon).
No US release as of yet.
I was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film, and yet most of the characters have larger-than-norm eyes, especially the girl characters.
Despite the wasps and their infrequent screen time, the movie has the look and feel of a very cheaply-made film yet is able to tell a decent...okay, almost decent story.
The potential family comes in to meet theirs and naturally they wonder why the older one isn't married yet, so the propose that one of their other sons marries her, that is when Rani's character drops the bombshell on them all that she is already married.
Daryl Somers refused to change the format of the show (like the bosses/fans kept telling him he should) and so it got axed (yet he was still suprised).
I hate it when 4,000 babies are being aborted a day in the USA, and yet I'm supposed to cry over a dead rhino which is far more important in their eyes.
Ken Russell directed and co-authored this flagrantly useless biography of silent-screen legend Rudolph Valentino, adapted from the book "Valentino, an Intimate ExposÃ© of The Sheik" by Brad Steiger and Chaw Mank; certainly the producers and actors associated with this film knew of Russell's penchant for the gross and bizarre, yet everyone seems to have jumped on-board blindfolded.
This is my first review ever, what a way to start where no one has posted anything yet so here it goes.
On Broadway, perhaps its most disturbing element was its ending -- yet that was jettisoned for the film version because of the "moral" dictates of the times.
James spader should be ashamed, better yet humiliated for ever even thinking this movie was a good career move!
Great, great, great (have I overdone the repeating-adjectives-three-times yet?)
Oh yeah, It also has great, great, great (have I overdone it yet?)
And Hritik, move your shapely yet non-talented ass over.
In short, this is yet another horror film that you'll have completely forgotten two hours after seeing it.
Kinichi, Sakai, Nokamura and the rest seemed like really nice people--skilled, yet honorable and humble.
Even so, its easily the weakest Maddin film I've seen yet.
Yes the concept was similar yet the movies are completely different.
Rani Mukherjee is much more beautiful in the Chalte Chalte, yet gives a more charming performance here (looks aren't everything).
Millions of people I know love the title song yet it didn't appeal to me.
While Moore is convincing as a semi-retarded woman, Close is simply annoying in yet another wicked-witch-from-the-South role.
No boastful muscles, and no exceptional dancing skills, yet so effective.
After the railway journey she is seen alighting in a supposedly war-torn, yet oddly blimp-free and undamaged London from a post-war (indeed relatively modern) London bus.
This movie is made as simple as they could and yet made it look nice without any huge sets, or without of having characters in the story who are like supposely equivalent to Bill Gates.
So if you haven't seen it yet, go see it right now.
I was expecting something simple, dumb, yet enchanting - something in the realm of Chocolat or Bewitched.
Now i haven't actually seen it yet, so i don't know.
OK,the thing is that miramax couldn't bother to make a decent script for the 2 latest hellraisers(hellworld and deader),so instead they took some old script they hadnt filmed yet,put cenobites to it and voilÃ¡,they had a new hellraiser script.
Complete horror failures such as "Fear Dot Com" and "My Little Eye" apparently haven't made it fully clear just yet: the internet is NOT scary!!
And yet in this eighth sequel, Rick Bota; also known as the dude who doesn't allow the Hellraiser franchise to die peacefully; presents Hellraiser now as a popular internet game that has nerdy followers and organizes secret parties in isolated mansions.
'HELLWORLD' is yet another horror flick that seems to have been inspired by Wes Craven's NEW NIGHTMARE.
If there is actually yet another sequel, hopefully Clive Barker will be involved.
"Just like any other ultra-violent twenty-four hour wildly popular and yet utterly purposeless embraced-by-the-masses Internet role-playing game."
"Do you believe him yet Jake?"
It revolves around the characters spending troves of time on each, yet managing to develop NONE of them.
I cannot yet comment on the replayability of this film as I have only seen it once, but it is almost a surity that the movie would be as good on the second watch.
It's been three films now and there might yet be more in the offing.
We may yet see Hannah Hunter and Nick Macaluso back again for those interested.
Gotta love the blonde doctors with killer bodies - the second blond chick was a particular great actress - SARCASM if that wasn't clear yet.
Directed by Tibor Takacs this is yet another by-the-numbers Nu Image produced creature feature the likes of which I'm sick of.
It is yet to be seen whether Fliegauf or any other Hungarian director could make an intelligent and socially significant impact on the issue of drugs in Hungary.
And yet, I found this film to be the worst, most pretentious piece of crap I've ever seen in my life.
From what I gathered, they picked a bunch of better than average-talented no-name, yet, attractive actors to star in this, spent the time to throw in some (keep in mind, the word here is 'some') snazzy direction, and some decent music and lighting.
So lame that there were a couple that you wanted to see die horrible deaths, yet, this never happens.
How can the Enterprise drop the warp core yet still make it back in time to save Picard?
The villains claim they don't want to co-inhabit the planet because "it would take ten years" to feel the effects, yet the Enterprise crew are significantly affected within hours!
And I haven't even mentioned the joystick yet...
Additionally Picard takes up with a Baku who has spent her last 300 odd years learning how to look like a pouting airhead even when tons of rubble are falling on her head, yet cannot row a boat or swim when she needs to.
These are the kind of people who make the world a sh*tty place to live in: corrupt, lazy, lying, drinking-while-driving, gun-toting, dope-smoking, misogynistic, anti-intellectual, selfish, ignorant pieces of sh*t. These people corrupt the military, the police force, school-systems, essentially everything they touch, and yet I felt that these characters were being glorified throughout the whole film, except for towards the end when Bale goes nuts; however it is at this point that I felt Rodriguez stepped-up to being the hero.
They don't bother) and very poor in character development, even the basic kind (the chief of the band of thieves appears to be Little John, yet suddenly it's Robin.
Despite the rage of Gene's wife at the community therapy, it eventually uncovers what really happened with the death of little Andrew, the 8 year old boy and it leads to a sad yet not totally unexpected conclusion.
And the worst is yet to come!
Unprofessional, poor excuse with no redeeming features, made by a talentless hack who is so naive about the industry and yet so pretentious - the two always go together.
In "A Winter Tale," Solomon along with her talented cast deliver a complex yet common story that respects the audience's interpretative freedom by preserving the dynamic lives of each character.
We're told-- and shown-- throughout "Sunshine" that the sun will burn you to a crisp in less time than it takes to think the phrase "bug zapper," and yet at the end Cillian Murphy's scientist-hippie-savant Capa stands face-to-face with a roiling wall of solar plasma without so much as a blister on his milk-white skin.
And have I mentioned yet how much I despise selectively "smart" computers?
As in, a computer that talks to you and calls you by name and yet can't tell you when half your spaceship has just caught on fire?
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
Whomever that Jack Frost is really shouldn't quit his job at Jack in the Box just yet.
We have a conniving bitch-witch who is crafty enough to throttle an invalid in a wheelchair, yet balks at the use of a gun on a would-be rapist.
And yet it achieves greatness in a way only the most bereft of talent can, a deliriously incompetent mishmash of bungling Kung-Fu action, tomato-ketchup horror and side-splitting soft porn.
Another film based on a story by AAV Creative Unit This movie walks that fine line between being "one of the absolutely worst films ever made" and "one of the absolutely worst films ever made, yet somehow entertaining".
A movie fit with hidden lies upon the stuggle in America, showcase a nonstop heartfelt sympathy for a man who strives for much more yet receives acceptance only in wish.
If you want people picking apart things by actually being funny watch "I Love the 80s", "I Love the 70s", "I Love the 80s Strikes Back", the upcoming "I Love the 90s", or better yet, "Mystery Science Theater 3000".
At no time did I accept Divine as a woman, and yet this movie insisted that I do so even to the point of enduring scenes where he/she attempted to seduce various male characters, and even attempted to provoke (if memory serves) a rape scene.
A woman apparently discovers her husband has been murdered-there was no motive for her to have done it yet she's arrested.A lawyer gets her off on some sort of technicality-which could have been due to the fact that there was no fingerprints,witnesses or motive but the police need to do this stuff.
He's won yet another case, which makes him look good but makes the police chief look like an idiot.
There us no reason why this movie should ever have been made the first time yet alone twice.
It promises an explanation for the current audience's fascination of torture porn, but yet resolves to become an exhausting and manipulative torture porn story.
The boys' language is grammatically correct and unprovocative, yet at the same time slightly "off."
He sets it up as a violent film, and yet almost every act of violence takes place off-camera.
I thought it was cool that the father from "Family Matters" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures.
That bad guy has the super hearing ability yet more than one time someone sneaked to his back.

Eddie Murphy is a great actor in yet another great movie.
Written & directed by Cartney Wearn I watched Pray for Morning last night without knowing a thing about it, the title is rather vague & could have referred to anything so I didn't go into it with any great expectation yet I still found myself disappointed & not particularly having a good time.
Who would ever think that power would still be connected to an old abandoned hotel, yet they try the breakers and presto, they have lights!!
The concept of an ongoing truce between the resistance fighters and the occupying German army also seems ludicrous to me, yet this is a central theme of the movie.
I'm sure that Yallop knows far more than I do about the Hulten/Jones case, yet I spotted two inaccuracies.
This film's art direction is elaborate, yet wretched.
On the one hand, he's cold-blooded and cruel, yet he also enjoys dressing well and seems very cultured.
I only give it a three because Collins surprised me with his acting chops (Haven't seen Buster yet) and can play a jerk very well.
Incidentally, Roberto Rossellini had already made a film out of Arthur Honneggerâs opera JOAN OF ARC AT THE STAKE (1954; which has, thankfully, just been released as a SE DVD in Italy) featuring the directorâs then-wife Ingrid Bergman; I havenât watched this yet but did recently acquire the latterâs earlier 1948 film about the famous inspirational but misunderstood warrior-saint.
However, CAMP BLOOD was also filmed entirely in daylight and did not even have the benefit of a claustrophobic indoors setting, yet it surpasses SERIAL SLAYER by miles in terms of entertainment value.
It is the middle of the day in cali-suburbia, yet, these girls fear leaving the house at slight bumps.
I don't know how to sum this one down - it felt like I sat through 8 movies at once; bewildering, confusing, laughable, yet somehow very entertaining.
Shore is like that class clown who tries hard to annoy everyone in sight, yet at the same time tries hard to be liked.

Along the way, he picks up Jules (Crispin Glover, in another obscure yet excellent performance), a bird-loving, awkward man.
The husband is a highly intelligent civil servant and yet is portrayed as a moron who hasn't a clue about what is going on.
It was yet another remake that failed to provide a new insight into the story.
No one yet has equalled the story as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
(Somehow, casting Richard E. Grant as Stapleton pretty much gives the game away right off the bat; yet with his tall, slender build, Holmesian hairline, feline grace and dusty velvet voice, Grant seems more like a natural Holmes than poor Roxburgh, with his occasional Down Under twang.)
The story is simple yet original and the flow and pacing for the film is perfect.
The criminal organization that "Cynthia" goes after is supposedly making billion dollar deals, yet its headquarters seem to be a small cheap room.
And yet, this is still a parable about Japanese society, which has a strangely universal-appeal.
And yet, the story is creepy.
Where the original took horror to a new, edgy level, the follow-up took the turn into comedy, yet this third installment merely set up a similar, yet bland premise, that really isn't worth more than brief, mild entertainment.
Shinya Tsukamoto isn't a great director yet, but he's getting there.
He hasn't quite achieved true greatness yet, but one day he may just break through.
This is yet another entry in the DVD called "The Animation Show, Volume 3" that features a too-mean edge, an unfunny and unpleasant short film with an extremely heavy-handed agenda.
For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors.
It hasn't been taken down yet, because no one cares about it.
The movie did not develop her character too well and yet a lot hinged on her.
Here we have yet another movie directed by someone who has absolutely no business behind a camera.
I laughed out loud yet, at the same time, admired the filmmakers' audacity.

There's a final scene where our hero chucks a talking watch out the window to avoid talking to yet another one of his girlfriends, his bosses' secretary.
As for Joe Don Baker, yet another blot on this underrated actor's record.
The passengers never really seem to be in direct personal jeopardy, particularly with odds of about 1:10 (including the terrorist flying the plane) and yet they seem too paralysed with fear to do anything.
The director necessarily had to use some artistic licence in making this film and yet could have used more to establish a bit more tension.
(Whether this happened or not, we will never know, yet the knee-jerk vengeance perpetrated in the film is applauded.)
It's hard to think of a movie more execrable, yet the film has an endearing charm for all its misguided inanity.
How come the former St. Louis cop hyper-competently instructs the yokels how to duct tape their houses but yet decides to keep his Morse code short-wave radio knowledge of the extent of the national destruction a secret for only the viewers to melodramatically know at the end of episode 2?
The film throws out all sorts of allegations, and yet does not back it up.
Thousands of American soldiers were involved in the invasion and yet the film does not have a single ONE backing the films allegations.
After hundreds of conversations and interaction in virtually every facet of daily life with Panamanians, I've yet to encounter a hint of regret for the U.S. invasion.
And yet, the U.S. closed its military bases, and today Panama is one of the most robust democracies in the Western Hemisphere and operates the Canal in sovereign fashion.
Bad in every sense of the word and a few senses that haven't been invented yet.
Skerritt has a rifle, yet jumps from the balcony to fight the hoard with his bare hands.
I haven't seen any of his movies yet except half of Rear Window in school, but I'll watch The Birds this weekend.
Worse yet, the sets do not look at all like anything reminiscent of "1963."
I dug a few of the jolt scenes and suspenseful "race to save a life" moments, yet the conclusion is very confusing as it attempts to come together and put the pieces in place...
The acting is 'allright' and the characters are given enough screen time to develop, yet they can do little to save the film from its script.
This is yet another painfully boring movie that tries to get by on soft-core pornography and (oh so shocking!)
Since Kino on Video hasn't decide to release it in this country yet or time warner, they own the distribution rights of most of the classics of the U.F.A.
For those who wanted an action movie, I'm told De Palma dumbed down the other MI movies, thus moving it further yet from the spirit of the original series.
They trivilized the major events and happenings and they "claimed" it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family.
It's a trip of only a few yards, yet they have to stop to rest frequently.
The climax of this movie is the middle, which isn't a good thing at all, and that's when he is proclaimed dead by the doctors, and is sent to be buried in the graveyard, the same thing we've seen in the beginning of the story, but it hasn't touched a character we care about yet.
Half the time one does not know what's going on and the other half I just wanted to leave the theater for yet another trip to the popcorn area.
He constantly bickers about how he hates sponge bob and Pat and yet he still lives next to them.He's very pretentious and is very sad all the time.Every time I look at him he's gives you this suicidal mentality!!
In short, this is yet another silly cartoon that has gotten way more positive press than it deserves and exists mainly to drive the production of more merchandise.
Worse yet, the main protagonists are so uniformly cardboard, irritating, and underdeveloped that one simply doesn't care whether they live or die.
Dennis Smith's generic shivery'n'shuddery score, the headache-inducing blaring alternative soundtrack, the variable acting from an attractive, but charmless and unlikable cast, and one of those always unwelcome groan-worthy "it ain't over yet!"
Second Rip: Use of a chain saw for graphic death was once again ripped from TCM  Third Rip: The group of kids going strait to the killers house is yet again from TCM  Fourth Rip: Their college Kids!
From the one's that I have seen, I think this is the worst yet.
I had never seen those other actors and..well..they were newcomers with not so much talents, at least yet.
A ridiculous movie that plays to the '60s-style stereotype that a lesbian is a woman who hasn't found the right man yet, so bides her time with another woman.
And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time?
Admittedly I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so I didn't go in with many expectations, yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming.

One has to wonder "just what IS this"; yet what compels one to continue watching?
She was so quick to plunge the needle into so many of her later victims yet she took so long in her attempt on the heroine that the lift doors open.
As no one has yet commented on this piece of trash I think it is my civic duty to warn people not to be tempted by the title into watching this.
But, having explained away preceding events by invoking a mad professor and then wound up his story by an 'and then they all went back to their previous lives' scene, the film-maker then commits the cardinal error of pressing the reset button -- or in this case, throwing the freeze-ray switch yet again.
Only the professor notices, so he reverses the switch yet again... demonstrates to his disbelieving colleague, jerking everybody on and off... the world 'compensates' by being cranked extra fast, Keystone-fashion... and the whole thing descends into slapdash tedium of a fairly primitive kind, which has ceased some time earlier to be entertaining.
That this show is renewed once much less that it ever got on air at all is yet another example of how dumb our country has become.
Wanna see a movie about being fashionable yet an outsider?
See Mean Girls or better yet, Heathers.
Also I have yet to see a movie with Donald O'Connor in it and not love it and him even more than I already do.
He was a superb comic, a gifted actor and a dancer of extraordinary talent on par I think with Fred Astaire and his 'Singing in the Rain' co-star Gene Kelly, yet his contributions to film, have on the whole been overlooked.
We're not done yet.
The irony about slasher films - and I guess CM can be classified as something of that nature - is that religious folk probably don't approve of them at all, yet the moral of most such films is very clear (and very Catholic): IF YOU HAVE (EXTRA-MARITAL) SEX, YOU MUST BE PUNISHED - AND DIE.
Reminded me a little of polanski's ninth gate somewhat (and that's a good thing), but I doubt that anyone else would make that comparison :) I've been thinking about this movie for five months, figured it would be a shoe-in on the art-house circuit, but haven't heard much yet, this movie deserves to be seen!
I haven't seen this movie yet, but my husband has.
The cinematography is very poor to the point will convince you that the movie was filmed by an armature camera man using normal portable camera on the planet which didn't discover the film effect yet !
This must be one of Shue's worst yet, While watching the film I was intrigued by the sheer mystery of the film.
Only Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley are worth watching, even though Foley is tragically underused yet again.
The thing is, these creatures aren't vampires - they're a new type of creature that I hadn't heard of yet.
It's the start of yet another straight-forward slasher, which is pretty unwelcome.
This film was made in 2002 and yet it contains an almost porno soundtrack.
A few other points not yet brought up...
It's got the grainy, neo-realistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had (and as many of Lumet's own films had), yet it never really works.
He's supposed to be a virile, dedicated newshound and sex machine and yet....with his strangulated accent and tendency to go cross eyed when he's concentrating, I end up trying to curb my laughter.
The setting is in some sort of weird post-Nazi Poland (yet most of the people have American accents) where the fashions and vehicles resemble that of 1941, yet pop culture of today has been blended in to give it that 'unique' flavor (ie.
The most embarrassing scenes was seeing Adrian Paul flying around through the air, 'MATRIX-style', wielding a tommy gun in slow motion as he fires at the bad guys, yet you can see the 'pull-strings' that suspend him through the air, it is too hilarious for words!
The lead happens to be a stolen van which they find & in a nearby building discover yet another dead body.
Unlike some dark power personalized in Spielberg's truck driver this movie deals with a very recognizable, yet equally dark power of nazism.
This may not be of Hollywood stature likened to "The Schindler's List", yet it's a small film with powerful impressions.
times the micro is visible, which is not very professional and yet not hard to avoid...
A horror short about werewolf-children would have been quite original, yet we never see them transform in hairy little monsters with huge fangs or sharp claws.
In fact, there's just one transformation-sequence in the whole episode, yet the special effects were laughable and far below usual Hammer standards.
Dogs get butchered, people disappear, a boat blows up - and yet nothing seems to wake up this small (and probably quite jaded) fishing community.
Was it all of the misunderstood yet well-meaning kids in detention?
My God, the last time I checked in the mirror I was Black, and yet when I go to the movies I start to question it b/c my parents aren't drug dealers and I've never seen a gun before.
the pace of the movie is curious, as it lingers in some dull spots, yet fast-forwards ahead, turning rookies to professional-calibre tango dancers in about 8 minutes.
This is where yet another pointless character, Sasha (Elizabeth Rodriguez) is introduced.
She has some sort of an undefined problem where it is obvious that she is depressed and sleeps around, yet it is never actually explained.
John Cleese is unconvincing as a Sheriff, Danny Glover misses Mel Gibson as a funny Man, and Kevin Kline demonstrates yet again he does not have as broad a range of talent as his press releases suggest.
The 1986 version went at a much faster pace, which gave an exciting and sinister edge to it, and didn't use half of the sub-plots used here, yet still managed to get a good hour and a half slot.
Some interesting passages--and a bizarre climax--yet one is inclined to believe the film may have been pared down in post-production...it feels truncated and tampered with.
We have yet to see that story.
For much of the film, the mirror actually stays covered up by a white sheet, yet projects a sinister feel.
Then in Jesus Our Savior, he totally throws those lessons out the window and goes out to fight his most powerful enemy yet ALL ALONE.
Bibleman takes every opportunity to make its villains look goofy and non-threatening, and altogether doesn't take itself very seriously with numerous self-referencing jokes, yet constantly turns around and tries to tell its viewers how to live in God's way and other serious issues.
The writing is crude and ridiculous at times, yet there are worthwhile ideas to explore.
No spoilers here, folks: if you haven't seen this yet at a local festival, hopefully you'll get the chance if this becomes part of a horror shorts collection in the future.
No matter, because soon Aristocrat joins the ladies for yet another threesome, brilliantly mirroring the previous threesome scene.
If all this painful human suffering isn't enough yet, the waters are also infested with bloodthirsty tiger sharks.
Odile could very well turn her down, yet a heart-pounding desire inside both women drives them to accept the passion that awaits them.
We are taken to yet another remote village in the desert (again, without any explanation or reason whatsoever).
They barely seem connected or interested in each other, and yet we're led to believe that they've made love.
Dear Lord, save us from the same set of stereotypes yet again -- even more crudely and lazily fashioned than they usually are.
There is a school bus sign to let Charlie Bartlett know where to catch the bus, yet no one else gets on at that stop.
in the first 2/3rds of the movie, and yet despite the presence of these skin scenes, the movie is a very uncommercial and personal effort.
The setting is an old school house yet the furniture is in great condition without any dust.
I was saddened to find out that these mini-films were made over a decade ago and prey that some day, Harrison Ford and Sean Pattrick Flannery may be brought together again (as they did in the Chicago episode) and have another go at yet another piece of the Jones saga, before yet another unfamiliar actor is brought upon to don the cowboy hat once again.
There were so many things TO laugh at: the plot was completely lame, the dialogue unrealistic, the acting terrible, yet I still think that for as bad as it was, it should have been funnier.
From be it, writer to director or both, I've yet to see a flick I haven't liked of his.
A reasonable inference is that a LOT of dope is missing, yet when the box of narcotics is finally discovered in a locker at Grand Central Station, it's only big enough to contain, say, three dictionaries.
Overall "Cat's Eye" is not highly entertaining and can be readily classified as yet another poor representation of Stephen King's literary compositions on film.
Get it yet?
I wasn't surprised he was amazed to receive yet another undeserved Oscar nomination for this garbage, not only is the film so terribly acted by its elderly cast but there is nothing good about Burton's awful performance at all.
There is a reason why it hasn't seen the DVD light yet, and it would be a waste of disc space if it miraculously did.
I haven't seen "American Psycho II" yet, but no doubt his laid back "cool" style has ruined that film also.
Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video.
I haven't even seen the third one yet.
And despite being also always formulaic they yet always felt like something new and original.
But yet he's above all of course still an hero in this movie, who does everything right, everyone respects and admire and whose clothes never get dirty.
What I always like about Olivia de Havilland in her early movies is that despite being always the dame in distress, she yet is a strong and independent character.
The love story (yet again) between the two doesn't feel like its slowing done the movie or distracts from the main-plot.
The first time I saw this film it really scared Me!The alien is very realistic and the scene where the scientist is operating on the alien's mate is disturbing but yet realistic.I don't want to go any more but I'll tell you this that if you like alien,sci-fi and horror films then check it out!
Charles Coburn is the inspector of Scotland Yard yet he has no British accent.
The era embodied a sort of innocence which dissipated towards the end of the decade and has sadly yet to return.
This has got to be the worst remake I have yet to see!
the thing that got me annoyed with federal protection was that it was completely boring.Armand Assante is first billed yet you hardly really see him in the film Dina Meyer steals most of the film as an annoying smart ass character.
Carl and Melissa are both longing for a lover, and have yet to meet each other.
and finallyÂ   8) not an implausibility, but yet another ridiculous inanity: When Eliot goes to Tom's dad's house to visit the old man (Mom died while the boys were in LA), they have a kitchen conversation during which the old man is framed by the camera standing in front of a canvas of the 'Our Father', and Eliot is framed in front of a canvas of Jesus on the opposite wall.
However, Ezterhaus should still be taken to task for writing yet another movie about a wildly successful and sexually adventurous female psychologist/author that lives in San Francisco and is under investigation for murder.
Together with the woman's husband being yet another killer, and her still being trapped in a very uncomfortable marital situation.
Sure, this was written by the king of sleaze Joe Eszterhas (this was the lowest he got yet: one of the victims held a collection of female pubic hair) but at least Paul Verhoeven managed to turn "Basic Instinct" and even "Showgirls" into something more watchable than this rubbish.
This is the fourth Guy Maddin film I've seen--the others are The Dead Father, Tales From the Gimli Hospital, and Twilight of the Ice Nymphs--and I have yet to be impressed.
It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.
Towards the end-- in search for America, Nukie ends up going down two giant water falls, and yet some how manages to live-- he should have died, really he should have, why not?
I mean was I the only one that wondered who the heck was the big guy that they featured when looking at the death eater yet never told you what he's purpose was.
Overall, this movie just continues the downward spiral these movies have been in since at least the second or third film, and is easily the worst yet.
Grint has always been one of the best British comedians of modern time I have seen, and now he has proved it yet again.
It is by far the worst Harry Potter film yet.
Harry is meant to believe that Snape is a full fledged Death Eater, yet he lets Harry get off scott free?
Definitely the weakest film yet, too many things taken out, and too many silly things put back in.
The actor playing "Steve" is H-O-T yet he's not even listed in the movie's end credits.
There must be hundreds of as yet unknown Irish actors who could have played the part convincingly but we have to put up with an American "star" who insults our intelligence with his pathetic attempt at an Irish accent.
Christie hasn't figured out the low-effort formula that would keep her up to her ears in cash yet.
And yet.......few actors project "sincerity" in a character any better than Gant does.
And simply putting Christopher Lee in a film - doing his sect-leader yet again - does not rubber-stamp it with integrity (he's left out to dry almost as much as the redundant chick-interest, Natta).
Haven't we learned yet that there is no such thing as a "value-free" education?
Damned if I knowÂ Throughout the entire movie, the value and importance of these papers is continuously emphasized, yet not one character ever reveals anything about their content.
Poor Marjoe Gortner is stuck in yet another lousy movie, the guy just couldn't catch a break.
Terry Moore from Mighty Joe Young fame has a nice role, Marjoe Gortner has an intriguing yet thin role as a doctor in league with Woronov, and the aforementioned Dyanne Thorne has a brief cameo as a patient that thinks she is an actress.
Now people will claim "but this is the closest to Ian Flemings original version of Bond that we've yet seen, and that makes him a good Bond, maybe even the best."
But it's always been a clear and obvious fact that the Bond films have never had much in common with Flemming's novels except for the titles, yet it has still become one of the most beloved film franchises of all time; Obviously not beloved enough to stop them taking over forty years of tradition and mythology (the one liners, the gadgets, the over-the-top villains and their over-the-top deaths)and flushing it all down the friggin' toilet!
(Now there are only 20 minutes to the end)  The bad guy captures Bond and his Lady, tortures him and gets killed by another bad guy that has not yet been introduced to us.
If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film, there is a problem.
"Not yet,gentlemen" did I think.
None the less, Dick is supposed to be a tough military dude, yet he obviously has a few hours a day to pluck those dainty eyebrows of his.
Like anything this riddled with clichÃ©s, there is an initial problem with the two of them, but eventually a spark misfires and Gadget is introduced to yet another love interest.
I mean "on" Toho's studios yet?
I also find it extremely utopic and epic, yet it is your choice to watch it or not.
There is lack of character development in many of the minor yet important characters.
The script is brimming with trite clichÃ©s, yet is oblivious to this and makes no effort to put a fresh spin on them.
Two new characters come into view, a new Rugrat, Kimi, and the step-mother of Chuckie, which has yet to be determined.
I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be.
They go to see Walton and yet there is NO romance!
Ryan Philippe though had his best presentation yet.
All through the film, she's parading around in an incredibly sexy yellow top and her beautiful voluptuous boobs are constantly on the point of popping out Â yet they never do.
Since then I have yet to take my kids to a Dreamworks film (especially after seeing Shrek).
It was a cartoon meant for children (originally) yet all they talked about was sex, and used provocative language, obviously not for children.
The underhand and drawn out way Dr Lipman goes about ingratiating himself into his new family in order to obtain a donor match for his leukaemia is way too ridiculous - he's obviously severely ill yet he wastes precious days beating around the bush and tricking his brother into a blood test instead of coming clean immediately ... with obvious results.
Madchen Amick also performs greatly, yet can't save the script, either.
I am a huge fan of Dragonball, love that stuff, but after watching "The Tree Of Might" Pioneer's Dubbed version I found that it wasn't anything special at all, I mean don't get me wrong there were a lot of good fight scenes here and there, but yet again, the ending was SOOO predictable!
So "Alien Degli Abissi" is just entertaining Margheriti nonsense (featuring yet again fun miniature effects) and nothing more.
So it should work yet it doesn't even come close.
For instance Dudikoff is crippled in the beginning of the film (My guess is that he broke his leg doing one of the stunts for the movie) and yet despite this he still manages to outdo his American Ninja styled heroic actions with plenty of gusto to spare.
The horrid death, which conveniently isn't shown to us for the sake of a PG-13 rating (yet more was shown in the previous movie, which was also rated PG-13), just happens to occur in Astoria, Oregon, the far and distant land where Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) have escaped to all the way from Seattle.
After all, she knows Samara has returned for them, yet when Aidan has a nightmare that he refuses to share with her, his temperature drops five degrees and he starts acting really weird, she still is entirely clueless to what's going on.
The prof is being chased by men with a pack of hounds, yet somewhere along the way they disappear.
I wasn't even sure whether or not to flush the toilet lest I kill yet another bear.
What some people do not realize, or have yet to realize, is that the story is about a man who is at the edge of death.
There's actually not a lot more to say about the film, except that it's too bad that "June Bride" wasn't better, because it was rare for a couple of reasons: It was one of the few Bette Davis comedies and it was one of the few Bette Davis films I had not yet seen.
He does not even do his own sword fight yet we know he is capable as seen in Blind Fury in fact he doesn't move much at all.
Impossible to believe that someone put up money for the Tv series after seeing this, yet surely this is the first time that a TV show is better than the film that inspired it.
Her dyed blonde locks now toned down to a still teased, yet slightly more modest black.
I mean I can't believe that the Swedish language/accent hasn't change since 1150-2007Â The lines was empty and when the accents was so poor, this equaled in very low performance, and I sometimes felt that I was watching Swedish Big BrotherÂ I think this is because Swedish actors has not yet understood that acting is with whole body, eye moves, body-language, etc, not just standing there like a jukebox and saying your lines one after other.
and how come alex goes out of the blue so completely freakin' insane that she kills 4 people in gruesome ways, yet has been friends with the unsuspecting marie at college for a long time (and, apparently, displayed no symptoms whatsoever)?
Possibly worse yet is the fact that this movie may as well be 100 other movies.
I can't believe this has got rave reviews from critics and moviegoers; it baffles me when the same people slag off Paul W Anderson and Uwe Bowl yet praise this pile of donkey shite.
They truly resemble the graphics from the original Play Station, yet we are intended to believe that they are footage of the transportation of the future.
What's perhaps most sad, except for the fact that she miraculously manages to triumph (sort of), is that the director tried to make Audrey lovable and appealing to the audience, as a vulnerable, sweet, yet misguided woman, despite her effective ability to alienate the interest and care of most female AND male audience members.
But the worst thing about this sequel, aside from the scenes taking place on the other side, is the fact that this big budget movie is only 87 minutes long and yet if feels like it's three hours long.
This silly little low-budget number was extremely stupid, yet I cracked a smile once or twice despite myself.
Both styles observed back-to-back represent two different generations yet separated by just 2 years.
Hope to see them turn back up on the schedule, preferably not in a spin off but in fresh scenarios that allow them to develop and show off aspects of their talents we have not yet seen.
His performances are always stellar,as he is a "thinking" actor who gives his all to a character he plays.I have yet to see a "bad performance" given by Aamir.
This three-sided love story involving a feminist spinster, her rather dim protÃ©gÃ©e and a Southern knucklehead (I'm simplifying wildly here) involved me more than it should have, yet it left a bad the taste in my mouth.
Wow, "Panic" is yet another turd from the so-called "Chilling Classics" box set, a London-filmed epidemic tale sporting an Italian cast and crew, with international celebrities David Warbeck ("The Beyond") and Janet Agren ("Eaten Alive") lending some brand-name recognition the lousy ride.
You think this would be important yet Kirk, who is in contact with the government agents, never relays this information to them.
Here we have yet another over-ambitious scientist that falls victim to his own stupid research and mutates into a hideous and bloodthirsty monster.
It amazes me how much Sorkin has in common with M. Night Shyamalan - they both have enviable raw talent, are in love with their own works, and yet try so hard you just know that they're incredibly insecure about their own abilities.
The movie consists of a strong plot, good characters who are believable and yet, interesting.
Or better yet, "If it's by Chan-wook Park it has to be a 10/10 .
When you read the back of the cover and look at the pictures it's obvious that the film is marketed as an action/revenge-film, yet there's only a few exciting moments in the entire (and BTW extremely long) 2 hours.
Imagine going to grab a burger, you see the sign, the menu says "hamburger", and yet what you get is a salad.
... yet it also has some very sad moments which genuinely touches the heart!
There's talent there, as yet very raw but probably worth developing.
The title pretty much speaks for itself and yet we aren't anywhere near turning on a stove or air conditioner with our phone!!!!!
Cue Raymond Burr as mob boss Nick Ferraro, hopelessly trying to inject nastiness yet palpably unable to deflect the comic trajectory of Vincent Price.
The characters are real and very easy to relate to, the dialogues are simple and genuine, the proceedings are dramatic yet realistic, and the film is extremely interesting and entertaining.
Humans have fled the evil force that now rules the known galaxy, yet some living in a neo-primitive society (a hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and power rangers) fight back.
If you haven't seen the film yet, go watch it.
Baffling 'dysfunctional family' drama from Canada darts around in time yet fails to give us much to go on.
For me, he did a great job by experimenting with a novel idea, moving away from the well established norms of the bollywood industry and not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot.
John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange, yet still work.
June Allyson has a cameo, bringing in yet another plot twist.
X is clearly a ghost, yet hands Mulder a corporeal piece of paper?
Tong Po wasn't finished yet, because he ran away in part 4.
Geez, just think about how good, exciting, thought provoking films like "Metropolis" get chopped up so badly to the point of scenes being lost forever, and then released, yet films like this are still released in their original form.
I don't think words have been invented in the English language yet that can fully capture the disgracefully poor quality of "Killer Ants!
Funny that the ants attack a guy on a helicopter and yet the two dorks who are on foot somehow get ignored while they are sticking their hands into ant larvae (looks like rice-pudding) and kicking over the logs which are presumably the center of the community.
Grant, in an early role, had not yet gotten down his quirky mannerisms, but shows an affinity for light comedy.
Tom also spends a lot of time laughing at his own cartoons, which are painfully unfunny yet somehow earn him enough to pay the rent.
'Illegal In Blue' is yet another one of those movies where an idiot with connections to law enforcement repeatedly sleeps with the main suspect who we know will probably turn out to be the killer.
The film is poorly shot and goes on for too long, yet it gets extra stars for its camp value today.
His place has Japanese wicker furniture, a polished hardwood floor and yet he still mopes around in a funny hat just like in BUSTING looking all burnt out & washed up, which Elliot Gould is of course very good at.
And yet it has a certain something: Allen Garfield is one of cinema's great overlooked villain actors, his crazed bugging expert gave me nightmares after seeing THE CONVERSATION for about the hundredth time, and what's funny is that the movie actually has no problem with his high school teacher being a satanic pervert.
It's next Christmas and the family is going on yet another McCallister clan vacation.
This was certainly an odd choice for young director Francis Ford Coppola, who, with cinematographer Philip Lathrop, globe-trots to many an exciting location and yet overflows the movie with syrupy uplift and musical trilling (courtesy co-star Petula Clark).
He won't commit, yet he is in love with her and never forgets her, whilst she loves him too, but leaves him due to lack of commitment, and then she reappears, telling him she has cancer.
He claims to love her... yet he seems half-asleep.
If you thought "Trail of the Pink Panther" was a poor excuse for a movie, you haven't seen anything yet.
I think "Trail of the Pink Panther" (1982) wasn't all that bad yet.
Fonda and Kristofferson's first meeting isn't much of an icebreaker, yet the two are bedding down together by their second or third encounter.
It felt to me like the movie was still just beginning until half way through the final sequence -- nothing that felt like a plot had happened yet, so I had assumed that the real action was yet to begin.
I just see a spoiled little runt that rocket scientists would envy, yet for some reason we are supposed to care that this adorable little sandy haired genius is doomed to the dark side (which I determined earlier is much more agreeable than all that good Jedi stuff).
Starts with a woman who cooks (adobo - a Filipino dish) and looks out the window, while she narrates the opening spiel of the movie -- all to the tune of some funny yet wanting to sound mystifying music that continues throughout the movie-it was irritating!
I am perhaps viewing this film from too literal a viewpoint yet I came away thinking that I have been snookered.
Incomprehensibly lame, and yet I couldn't stop watching it.
Maybe on younger generations that haven't seen much yet, this movie i suppose can be funny or inspiring for them.
Following the cringeworthy opening scene with young Hellboy (surely just an excuse to get John Hurt in the film) i was hoping the film would pick up with the introduction to our villain, yet the almost immediate revelation of his fatal weakness ensured that we already knew how he would ultimately be defeated.
Every character in Scared to Death acts so suspiciously it becomes both irritating & distracting, I mean do these people want to be suspected of murder even though it hasn't even happened yet?!
Katrina has achieved what little ambition she has very early on in the film: her face on newspapers and her figure on television Â it's a celebrity status through horrific acts that someone like Charles Manson might know all about but the thing that's more agitating is its obvious reek of Natural Born Killers and how Suburban Mayhem uses the distorted television perspective complete with 'the guilty' speaking into a camera in a mock interview set up Â isn't that a clicÃ© yet?
I have seen some very good Australian films recently, most notably The Proposition and Look Both Ways and was looking forward to yet another quality Australian product.
After the vomit inducing, yet inexplicable box office success KM 31, I was more than ready to experience an upgrade in film-making, what I got was a major letdown, a pointless awkward "drama" filled with unnecessary sex and nudity that was surprisingly close to become a porn flick.
It's one of those confusing story lines that goes in many different directions and is hard to follow, yet at the same time it's not worth following.
They lose their hotel room, get mugged by a mysterious Graham Jarvis (as Murray), become captive of liquor store looters, get mugged yet again, Jack breaks his tooth on a Cracker Jack, he is accused of molesting a child, Sandy loses her wedding ring briefly, Lemmon has temporary hearing loss from an exploding gas main, and get caught in a anti-Communist riot.
The good news is that my drinking is not a health issue (yet).
He has no talents, and yet he is casted to do roles suited for pedestrians and other various people with no talent.
I have yet to watch Manos : The Hands of Fate, that flick is next on my list but unless you want to brag that you have seen the worst movie in existence do NOT watch this, its a real character building flick.
And yet, something happened.
One has to wonder "just what IS this"; yet what compels one to continue watching?
The show gets the viewer to empathize with Tom so strongly, that in the second season, when several stories see Tom accidentally kill and maim much of Jefferton, it became truly cathartic and hilarious, partly because Tom is the last guy on earth who'd hurt a fly, yet he truly deserves to eviscerate every last Jeffertonian.
The film started reaching for emotional moments it hadn't really earned because they'd never been established during the story and then it tried to cover way too much ground following Dorian from High School to college (in Greenwhich Village yet, where he manages to keep away from men for two years!
To wit: the mother of the poetess, whom we see only rarely in the first thirty-five minutes, comes off as a mostly absent entity whose only purpose is to arrive home waaay late every night and give our long-suffering hero a hard time for not taking proper care of her little sister (read: yet another obstacle for our poet hero to overcome on her way to heartfelt expository writing).
There are thousands of teachers in close proximity of young nubile teens, yet indiscretion is not rampant.
Better yet, read the Methuen Drama version of Miss Julie.
If you thought the incest plot from BROOKSIDE was bad you ain't seen nothing yet   Stephen Poliakoff judging by his previous work isn't a bad writer but he's written a very poor script here .
Renegades is a really predicable, humourless, dull & plodding action thriller that throws two mismatched yet boring characters together to bring down an equally boring enemy.
The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene in the most illogical places, action scenes got interrupted, and just when you were getting into a better scene, you get hit with yet another boring "but I love you, but I am Jedi, oh no, boohoo"-scene.
I have yet to see Episode 1.
My God, Lukas could have at least picked actors who haven't reached idol status yet, but no, he had to make his budget LARGER.
An outlaw gang rides into town led by Henry Fonda, who is only in the movie for about ten minutes and yet he steals the show from the lame cast of has-been actors.
This inspired my friend and I to watch some Borgnine films, and he suggested this rather obscure yet terrible piece of garbage (though he meant well, and I certainly didn't mind giving it a shot).
And I haven't mentioned the biggest problem yet: the marketing.
There are hardly any signs of Dolf struggling with the authority of the Priest Anselmus (yet another crucial thing in the original story).
Following a suspicious yet appealing job offer, young architect Maggie Walsh and her fiancÃ© Pete travel to the remote British countryside.
Right after the film boosts off, we can hear the gentle voice of Jude Law whining annoyingly about some kids, we don't even know yet.
He could make a two-hour film from a story that could have been told in fifteen minutes, full of dead ends, boring, irrelevant fluff to make up the time, dull action scenes and shameless pretentiousness, and yet still the public lavishes him with unconditional love.
I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point?
Godard shows no respect to Allen at all, yet Allen shows a great deal of politeness and respect to Godard even when Godard belts out questions in French without allowing his off-camera translator to catch up or be heard over his voice.
Godard's every effort, no matter how dormantly, panders only to him and leaves the audience to concede to the humble illusion of being below it, yet he claims with suavity to be making social, political and cultural statements as well as the idea inherent in the French New Wave movement, which was to challenge the convention of cinema and perhaps reinvent it.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't lost 90 minutes of your life with it, I did and I regret it!
It used to be fairly well matched to the running clock, yet now we are fed some completely unrealistic timelines, one of the several that annoyed me from ep01 last night was the 2 and a half minutes Jack had to steal a car, call into HQ, hotwire the car, drive somewhere (for arguments sake I'll say half a mile) park the car, find the right house, slip into the back yard, wait for the guard to come out, k.o.
Also, wasn't it nice of the guard standing watch, to not struggle while his neck is being chomped on and to die in 5 seconds without a noise or spurting any blood............  What used to be somewhat watchable and enjoyable (yet always somewhat far fetched) has turned into a complete joke of unrealistic moves, actions and timelines, just another good series gone bad due to poor writing and what probably amounts to the almighty dollar from the advertisers over content.
Better yet, stop by the local fast food restaurant and allow one of those pseudo-intellectual fans of this film to serve you a tasty lunch.
What I haven't seen before is a film that so shamelessly yet unpretentiously zings the industry as a whole, the average movie viewer, and itself, and all in good fun.
This one just groans until she is suffocated, yet never attempts to save herself.
Just when you think you struggled yourself through all the lousiest and most pointless slasher the 80's decade had to offer, you allow yourself to be fooled by yet another one.
From the witty banter, to the zany, over-the-top yet familiar characters, there is an utter lack of pretense that really lets you know how much the filmmakers loved this project.
She is some girl lacking self confidence but yet wants to be a stand up comedian.
It's horrific on every level, yet somehow compelling!
Surprisingly ROTOR didn't sweep the Oscars that year but i'm still at a loss at why this camp classic has yet to get a DVD released.
It's clearly more ambitious than a freshman college film project, yet it's lack of good continuity and gaping holes in the script would have surely gotten the film student a failing grade if it was made by one.
Unfortunately for us, such laws had yet to be invented and this lady behind the counter said that they didn't have RoboCop yet, but they had R.O.T.O.R.
Although this movie is supposedly based on actual events, the production values of the film betray that it is yet another old exploitation film--the sort that were produced by fly-by-night production companies to prey upon the public's fear AND fascination with sex and drugs.
Having said that the two main leads did put in a pretty good effort with Kevin Howarth, who I think is criminally underrated, proving his worth yet again as a villain by contributing a very convincing and creepy performance showing his characters descent from maverick cop to homicidal monster.
And yet, there are several positive elements to detect in this production!
ah yes... yet another vampire/werewolf movie.
However this was the worst yet!
I have yet to see the big-budget Beowulf movie from a couple years ago, probably never will.
If you've not yet seen WWHTKB, rent or buy it and decide for yourself.
Or, better yet, if you're in California, see it at the Gaffers' Film Festival.
I found rebecca to just be simply ridiculous she delivered her lines with the expressiveness of dried paint, she tried to be the quirky yet cute girl next door, then the dark broken stoner girl, roles few can pull off.
why don't these people have an Oscar yet?
I would have rather watched a film that had yet another group of hapless victims entering the Hive and getting slaughtered...
They were all expert marksmen yet no one was ever hit by a bullet.
I've seen thousands of films and this has got to be the baddest yet, not bad in the good sense, just plain bad.
Notice how the first 4-5 reviews are all stellar, and yet the people who actually just finished watching it on the first run of the broadcast schedule are hard pressed to give it even 2 stars.
The plot is original, the acting acceptable, the special effects teetering on the cheesy, yet still utterly entertaining, this film is a must-see for any true horror movie fan.
Like most movies with young actors, yet no aliens or psychopaths, it was labeled a comedy.
And yet, there was a later episode where the Witches were exposed, and the cleaners were not mentioned once.
And yet, in all later episodes, it said that blinking was a power inherent in all Warlocks.
let me sum up the first 7 years, since i haven't seen the 8th one yet (but ill watch it just so i know how the story finished)  I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch "maybe this is an innocent we just cant save" i love you *insert overly attractive male stars name here*, but i cant be with you because I'm a witch.
Recently got one of those Mill Creek 50 pack of horror and mystery PD movies (Tales Of Terror) because there were about 25 of these programmers I had not yet seen.I was already aware from experience that the quality on most of these is less than desirable but some can't be had anywhere else or were not worth paying ten bucks for alone.In this case I was taken royally as this print is missing the first 8 minutes or so leaving one to guess the rest.
Then you think, well maybe he's still alive, after all, in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end!
Rod Steiger offers yet another horrible example of overacting as the head of the gangster family.
I sort of enjoyed it, but then, it had no competition and I wasn't ready to fall asleep yet.
The stress isn't laid on The Tall Man in this first episode yet, and the ultra-cool Reggie (an ice-cream vending guitar player with a ponytail) hasn't got that much screen time, neither.
The story is lifted directly from 'Hollywood's clichÃ© underdog story writing' manual, yet the writer/director still manages to destroy this basic formula.
Or worse yet, just use this film as a kind of artificial babysitter, which I somehow doubt was what Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird had in mind for their original creations.
And almost all the other women, who for some strange reason had short skirts and very high heel shoes, might be yet another.
Coscarelli, who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise, has also made a few other films over the years: the recent "Bubba Ho-tep" and the ubiquitous cable favorite "The Beastmaster" are the most memorable.
Match 8) Undertaker Vs. JBL, after a good lengthy match JBL wins via disqualification, but Undertaker isn't done pummeling JBL yet.
I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen, desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger, confusion and frustration, yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.
Bill Thornbury as older brother Jody seemed mysteriously detached, yet after repeated viewings, I realized how correct this was in light of the twist ending.
They always show up in hordes yet while looking over the city, you never see them wandering in the streets.
At the barricade there were parked cars and stuff implying that there were civilians that came yet there are none with the leftover military men.
He somehow gets back onto the property unnoticed (which nobody has been able to do yet), then he sneaks around the property like some sort of ninja, then moves throughout the house without running into any of the military guys or any of the infected military guys.
I am not going to sit here and go on yet another tirade on how sub par this 1989 version of Agatha Christie's novel is.
One of them even gets carded at a bar and pulls out a long succession of fake ID yet it is obvious he is over 21.
And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world, yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.
I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.
Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.
One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage, looking like it is circa 1776.
It might have helped they made an attempt at a plot that made sense, or better yet actually did something with the characters.
Then I noticed that it only had 19 votes and there were no comments yet.
does action B-movies which are, in my opinion, usually better than most B-movies but yet always seem to fall just short of their potential.
And yet -as luck or fate would have it- never achieved even their level of success.
The pair soon learns that every boy must become a man (a typical, yet true moral).
Omri's character really is childish, yet endearing; his parents seem to pamper him, he's afraid of the dark, and he has lame 90's action figures; but he does mellow out in the end of the movie.
Klaus Kinski was listed as the star of the film in Europe, and yet he speaks no lines and interacts with none of the other characters in the film.
The cover had me fooled--perusing through the rental store, I thought I'd stumbled upon a zombie flick I hadn't seen yet (always a good thing), but it's NOT a zombie flick at all--zombies EAT people and traditionally don't talk, and that didn't happen here, so it can't be a zombie flick.
This is a major spoiler for you who haven't seen the movie yet, but it's a fun one, and the reason why I thought this movie was a comedy at first: Her dad wakes up in the master bedroom, coughing - he smells the gas and yells something like "honey!
This game has been out for a while, but if you don't have it yet: DON'T BUY IT!!!
In this tiny town -- and really that's being charitable; hamlet is more appropriate -- there are but a handful of inhabitants and only three apparent businesses (saloon, store, and undertaker), no court or jail, no regular transportation services, no communications, no government offices of any kind, no mayor, and no law enforcement, yet a busily occupied lawyer?
The "bad man" (as the Irish woman refers to him) is stone drunk and yet he manages to hit every target, and no one dares to shoot at him!
And yet here we have two very talented individuals who can't even cut loose and strut their stuff.
Case in point: the fact that Olivia Newton John rarely sings on screen, even though this is a musical and we hear songs sung by Olivia and yet Olivia is probably seen performing her songs just a couple of times on screen.
All in all The Visitor is a passable time killer, that is incoherent, yet very fun to watch.
That weird poster that obviously drew us in and yet somehow had nothing to do with anything.
But yet I'd love to see it again just to relive how bad it was.
Nelson Eddy must have spun in his grave - and if was dead yet, that probably killed him!
So much of the film goes into emphasizing Sara's strength and independence-and yet we find that independence strangely lacking with regard to things that truly matter-leaving her a big talker, but one who manages to slink into a corner whenever trouble arises.
Instead, poor writing, bad direction, seemingly bored actors, and silly camera tricks in exchange for real scares, we're left with yet another forgettable haunted-house picture.
Better yet, were they thinking?
It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.
This is easily his worst yet.
It's hard to describe my feelings about the movie, because I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, yet at the same time I suggest people check it out (if you get the chance; don't spend a hell of a lot of money to purchase a copy of it!).
And yet I didn't think I would ever get through this movie and it's not that long.
It is one of the cheesiest movies ever made, and yet it has a cult following.
Better yet, forget this film and just go with the other Thomas offerings.
When "King Kong" was being remade in the mid-70's, a Korean company decided to cash in on the remake and produce their own version, in 3-D yet!!!
This movie is so terrible, yet so funny.
One of the worst things about this film is that the filmmakers were so ignorant of the subject matter, and yet promoted this as an educational film.
It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen "The Edge."
Anne Judson-Yager|Whittier| is supposed to be our heroine,our darling so to speak,yet she's almost as whiny and disposable as Tina and Marni,so how on earth is a sequel gonna work like this,when there is no one to root for?.
Still there are moments of pure fascination, emotion and heartache in this one (Spoilers #1) 3 2 1 The heroin addiction scene with Steve mentioned in previous posts becomes a frightening, depressing yet fascinating side note.
The plot is utterly ridiculous, including such impossible situations as Hathaway's character obtaining the (not yet written) manuscript to the seventh Harry Potter book.
Worth looking at to see Anna Paquin in yet another role that is truly beneath her.
And yet it looks like another wise investment for master Corman, as "Galaxy of Terror" is still a guilty pleasure of many horror fans and it's frequently mentioned as one of the more tolerable "Alien"-imitations ever made.
Overall, the film is engrossing, and yet has a repulsive quality.
The idea of women working during the war in the war production plants was critical to the war effort, and the attempts at coping with an almost unbearable life situation with women workers sharing a house while their husbands are overseas was common enough to have true dramatic value; yet, this movie never seems to reach its high potential.
But this is never explained, so we must take it at face value that the British imperialists were pigs, yet superior nonetheless to the blundering Maori.
I googled Bram Stoker to find out if indeed there even WAS a Bram Stoker's "Mummy" and haven't found anything he's written with that title...yet...
I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it (Maybe a couple of extra features, any Special Edition of it yet?).
The film only lasts a mere 70 minutes, yet it's insufferably boring and contains over 75% of redundant footage.
Looking at "Hercules in New York" is a reminder, there's hope for us yet.
Such as Arnold regularly proclaiming (with an even thicker Austrian accent due to him not yet mastering the English language) "I am Hercules".
Recently while looking at IMDb.com's "100 worst movies of all time" I saw it and realized I hadn't ranked it yet.
She is spoiled, and criticizes people she thinks are hicks, yet she's sleeping with her own brother.
Got the ending figured out yet?
); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn't quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.
But either he doesn't want to choose better scripts or perhaps they are not coming his way yet.
She knows she hates the guy, she knows she is a modern woman not caring about tradition yet she lets him treat herself as if she's his belonging for an entire day.
A marine colonel claims he gave the order to fire on a crowd, killing 83 people and wounding more than 100, ALL of whom were supposedly firing at his people with sub-machine guns and pistols - yet NOBODY else saw these weapons, not even the other marines who were returning fire (except, possibly, the three who died).
Furthermore, starving families still exist (although Stella's mother does well to encourage ignoring that), wars continue and isolated tragedies like Unity's go unabated, yet the intertitle states "all's right with the world."
I haven't bothered to read all of the other comments but I'm sure it must have been stated before -- this is a completely mediocre comedy that is simply yet another attempt by Hollywood to ride on the coattails of much better films like "Rushmore" and "Napoleon Dynamite."
A film that relies so heavily on special effects, and yet the effects look like something that was made in the early 90's.
Do we really need an evil villain that speaks like a gay man and yet is pseudo-straight that wants to have sex with a woman?
One dimensional character that is supposed to gain our sympathy and yet she failed to engage the audience to sympathize with her.
I can tell that this movie was starred by some really talented actors/actress, yet they were all hampered by the incompetence of the director.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
Or maybe become zombies...no not yet.
"Teenage Zombies" suffers from all these problems, yet for some reason I've never been able to forget it.
All of this seems so fabricated and yet so bizarre, like your most severe fever dream.
If you find yourself in the video shop and cannot find this cinematic treasure, yet the sequel jumps out and bites you , just remember that number one has very little redeeming features where as the sequel contains none.
It is the boxing movie on which all other boxing movies have drawn elements from ever since- the poor kid made good by his talent for boxing yet who is exploited by corrupt fight managers and his own material greed, the faithful girlfriend/wife out of the ring, the scenes showing the lure of riches and the moral decay it brings.
Garfield is intense and charismatic, Palmer is sympathetic and warm yet also keenly intelligent and aware and Canada Lee gets a striking role as Ben, the role being a major move forward for the portrayal of African-Americans on-screen.
Try getting some actors that actually have talent and a script that wasn't made up on the spot, or better yet-- do everyone a favor and go back to your day job.
Technically, comedies have a certain degree of humor, yet this one seemed to lack in that department.
Or better yet, make a dentist's appointment instead of watching it.
I love a movie where Tori Spelling just looks beautiful, yet does not speak.
I rather see something interesting yet loosely based on fact than something closer to the truth yet of the quality of a dramatization in a documentary.
Director Roberta Findley, wife of cult legend Michael, directs yet another bizarre, cheaply made, vulgar film.
It has nothing to do with anything yet has an interesting humorous edge as well as other pluses aimed to peak one's interest.
What the film needed was some sort of lurid angle that would have produced bared breasts or better yet a blasphemous native sexual rite combined with a supernatural kicker.
Apparently no one has ever fought Diamond and lived, yet Amy conveniently manages to do just that within the first half-hour of the movie.
How do you put two such beautiful, sexy, charismatic actors -- Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- in a movie, and yet have absolutely zero romance or heat or sexual chemistry in the movie?
If you haven't seen it yet: don't!
Hi all,  this is the perfect example of YASM = yet another stereotype movie.
This is a movie in my eyes that tries to say "hey, in case you do not like or understand me, you are just not at an appropriate level of evolution yet, okay?".
- weren't exactly inspired (Douglas, by this time, was past his prime and, unfortunately, his stint in the sci-fi/horror genre - which also comprised HOLOCAUST 2000 [1977; the only one I've yet to catch up with, though it's been shown on Italian TV quite a few times], THE FURY [1978] and THE FINAL COUNTDOWN [1980] - is best forgotten!)
And yet in 'The Merry Frinks' she is cast in the central and largest role, for one of the very few times in her film career.
On the surface, it sounds like the plot of countless other B pictures from the 1950s, yet Earth vs the flying saucers manages to rise above the clutter.
I was so looking forward to seeing this film, especially as it was made for the wonderful IMAX format, yet it turned out to be such a let down.
If you know nothing about the subject yet want to feel that you are flying with the aircraft then by all means go an see this film.
We have another sequence where the commentator talks about aircraft from other visiting nations, yet fails to mention the Israelis, whose F-16s we are viewing at the time.
However, i did have some expectations for the second series yet unfortunately, the second series failed to meet these expectations.
The movie loves its over-50 characters yet presents them behaving ridiculously in outrageous situations.
Cut to yet another completely different group of survivors.
They've secured a farmhouse and guns, yet there are countless scenes where, in pitch darkness, everyone simply stands on the field outside the house blindly firing at zombies ambling towards them.
Once they drag this out for another fifteen minutes or so, a noise is heard from inside a darkened barn (surprise, surprise), cue yet another dragged-out 'let's investigate with just the camera light to guide us' scene.
But you ain't heard nothing yet.
Then you hear that second gunshot, then another, and another...And another....And yet another.
you haven't seen anything yet...
I love the scene where 3 guys running up with flashlights sends the Squad into a blind panicked retreat off of an 80 foot cliff.. Oh i forgot they were simultaneous under attack by a tin helicopter that obviously encompassed the part of the film budget that the lesser Balwinite did not yet absorb.
Each one casts an empty fashion model glare at the camera complacent in their stereotypical roles: The good looking, cynical one; the bonehead sports player; the awkward yet talented little one; the token black British guy; and the jolly fat one.
Words fail me, and yet I feel I must try.
Through the sea of assembly line movies we come across a Vince Vaughn movie we hadn't seen yet.
I have to say this to the readers, if you haven't seen the 1986 version yet, you are missing a lot!
What no one yet realizes is that Lombardi has somehow managed to take Andrea back to her very first incarnation - that of a killer sea monster.
Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic "Heathers" knock-off.
I think the makers of this one need to be mentored by Moore for awhile yet.
This time she is given one final assignment (kill yet another victim) before ending her career as a professional assassin.
All three sequels were shot at the same time, from what I have heard, yet it took nearly four years for this installment to get released to video.
Sara Crewe is a singular character, rare as one can imagine,yet close to all of our inner beings;I recognise in my childhood-self her musings as to chance being responsible for who we are, her notions of inanimate objects having feelings of their own, her wistful conceptions of the thoughts of others -strangers she viewed during her daily outdoor errands to whom she gave descriptive names and mentally befriended.
However, Watson's limp wristed character is yet another prime example of gay stereotyping in early Hollywood.
In fact, the pacifistic aspect of Austin's character is laughable; here we have a guy who "killed more people than all the other 9 combined", and yet he keeps sparing lives of murderers who threaten his own.
Once I realised there was none, I realised we had been yet again tricked into admiring an Emperor's invisible suit.
The movie feels like it was a SNL sketch that should have lasted 10 minutes yet was stretched to fit an hour and a half.
Kind Hearts and Coronets stands easily as one of the best British comedies, yet it was set in the same historical period as Three Men in a Boat, was released six years earlier and was filmed in black and white.
How is Franz, a professor yet, unable to link his blackouts with the appearance of the ape-monster?
For instance, she is supposed to be Irish and not have any luxuaries, yet when she does take her clothes off and actually speaks you can see she has very distinct tan lines and she has a strong American accent.
Cold-blooded baddies fill kitchen workers with bullets, who jump onto the benches to die, yet offer cigarettes to someone when they askÂ Or ask problematic hostages to put the gun down.
Aaron, who "hates to travel", is unhappy about the trip yet, he must go along.
The fight scenes towards the end were long and tedious at times yet at other times were trying new things by adding weapons and such.
It is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation, and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.
Here's yet another example of 80's horror with no real soul or originality.
--Unoriginal kills, yet again.
The idea that law enforcement would be unable or unwilling to follow this neon-sign lit-up obvious yet laughable string of events.... Well, I'm just going to log my rating as very poor and suggest people do not pay to watch this film.
Why does the robot-wench at the end (who Richard Benjamin thinks is real) short out when he gives her water, yet the Yul Brenner robot-gunslinger character (among other robots)can pour whiskey down their mouths?
He is supposed to be "off," yet when we first see him, his thumb is turned up.
In this musicalized version of Arthur Richman's play "The Awful Truth", filmed as a straight comedy in 1937, Wyman wears a succession of shoulder-exposing, low-cut cocktail dresses and fur-lined evening wear, yet her wardrobe doesn't match her personality; Wyman's short, old-lady bob and her harried little face never give the impression she's having a good time.
The acting was sub-par at best, though I would say it may be Chris Kattan's best job yet.
Also why does the ghostly monster has to break down doors and floors in order to get to the heroes and yet the mortals get thrown through walls.
See the 1984 version, or better yet, read the book.
Better yet, they should have stakes driven through their hearts.
I'm not yet willing to blame the directors of the writers because I can't imagine how or why any writer would intentionally ignore the title character so completely like that for 12 solid episodes.
You won't believe this plot, yet again there is no oil and the chaotic future is desert like, but at least Mel Gibson rides a car, instead Michael Beck rides a (much cheaper I guess) motorbike.
As it is, it's not a good movie, and yet it's not bad enough to moan and groan over - moan and groan in either a laughable or a bored way.
But that impression wore off quickly and I was left just wondering why I was yet again subjecting myself to a flat, breathless Richard Carlson performance.
My anticipation level was even higher than for The Crying Game 2 (which still has yet to be produced).
MacLaine probably felt a little persnickety jabbering would goose the proceedings, yet there's far too much bickering back and forth between she and Cage, and both fall back on their proved shtick (MacLaine certainly on her Aurora Greenway from "Terms of Endearment").
Steven Seagal is the "Zen Master" (yet again) of the bomb squad.
The title is a little misleading but the book explains it yet not detailed enough.
Worse yet, it displays yet another method of animal torture to the soul-less cowards who do this already.
Instead we are given yet another "dregs of humanity" portrait that's been done before.
What we need to know is what drives it, why do people hate it yet spend billions of dollars to get the product.
It would have been interesting to explore why some of the female performers are so ashamed of their participation in the film that they refused to be interviewed yet the men have no qualms.
It's a fictional story yet has more real answers.
I just looked back at my notes on Highland: Endgame, still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see (also never seen an episode of the show), and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a C+ grade.
The one thing about Highlander that even made some bad episodes watchable were the sword fights, not here, the sword fights were idiotic and the villain was ridiculously fast and strong and yet the characters are able to fight him long enough for the writers to have a long enough fight.
And yet, we get to know from the bonus interviews on this DVD that the porno cinema, which plays such an important role in the story, was a real problem in the adaptation because there were no such places in London, due to their laws.
The setting could be anywhere in small town America in any working class family, yet this film is about a waterman's family and what they do in a time of crisis.
There are funny spots too where the audience feels pulled in again and again to this familiar yet unique world where the Tyler family lives.
And I haven't even mentioned all of it yet.
And we have to suffer through yet another half-witted attempt to re-invent the source of immortality and what happens if "there can be only one."
Strange gave a much stronger impression of willful mastery of magic, yet here he is rather the reluctant hero, which was never present in the original.
Chuck Norris stars as Col James Braddock a Vietnam vet who goes behind Vietnam to save American P.O.Ws and wipe out his enemies in this strictly routine yet very popular bodycount flick which appeals to die hards of the genre.
If you thought Tarkovsky was a one-shot in the Soviet Union when it came to beautiful yet haunting images, you'll definitely think again after this movie.
What gets me is that costs $35 million to produce yet there is no huge cast or no over costly effects.
It's been 15 years since I saw this movie yet it lingers in my mind like the taste of spoiled milk glibly drunk in the middle of the night right out of the carton.
Cronenberg has dedicated his career into revealing the ugliness behind mechanism by connecting it with monstrous things such as the scientist who becomes a fly, the victims of a car crash who become perverse, the TV producer who becomes illusional, computer game players who can't separate the game from reality, the exterminator who starts sniffing bug spray and also becomes illusional and can't separate truth from imagination, and most of his other work like in Dead Ringers, Scanners and The Dead Zone and probably in his older work that I have yet not reviewed.
I mean, there's a scene where they're in the middle of enemy fire, and yet they stop to deliver an exchange of like 4-5 lines that completely useless to the story line, but i guess some writer thought it was "cool".
I do know the Balkans are a very troubled region, where deep-seated xenophobia and nationalistic behavior make victims each and every year, yet this film didn't quite grasp that.
Warm, funny, ironic and profound (not qualities normally associated with Cronenberg), yet a wee bit little creepy (and with this director, could it be anything else?
For any one who thinks they might wish to see this film, I advise the MST3K version, or better yet, don't watch it at all.
Later however, I was watching sci fi channel and Mystery Science Theatre had decided to prod fun at it as well, so in conclusion, it's.....well bad yet funny.
This is the most stereotypical movie to come out since "Birth Of A Nation" but yet it's embraced by the black community for one and Hollywood seems to be OK with it.
Mix into the cast a beatnik cook who is out of place in this agricultural gulag, and you have an embarassing film that shows youth as rebels only in the sense that they do not conform to the arbitrary standards of the crooked, yet wooden authority figures.
Or we really do not feel the loss when she's killed and yet the direction makes it so that it's like the most important thing in the entire film.
If there is one memorable thing in the movie, and there is exactly one memorable thing, it is Gale Storm's first musical number - she is incredibly vivacious and sexy, in a dress which emphasizes her charms in a remarkable yet very chaste way.
When Bob Terry, the new star stroke for the team, who hasn't arrived at Rawley yet, gets drafted, Frankie and his pal, Tad, spot a big guy, Herc Bevans, hefting a safe on the street.
Now, I next to never cry but at the end when Jacey decides to let the Coopers adopt her son,Charley, is so sad but yet happy.
even people who aren't teenagers yet may like this movie.
Not at all a contender for being overly amusing as Stooge shorts go but when another supporting actor/actress is added that can obviously hold her own, comically, then there's hope yet.
Some say this is an influence on "High Plains Drifter", but in fact it is yet another rip off of Leone's films and "Django".
Better yet, rent "Keoma".
You both love this atmosphere - it doesn't seem stifling at all - yet understand how the "Angry Young Men" and then the Beatles could have wanted to blow it up.
Laughton is particularly good - loathsome yet real-seeming.
An animated lexicon of WWII clichÃ©s for toddlers who have yet to rent "Where Eagles Dare" or "Battle of Britain."
All I can say is that it was well worth it..I loved the cast and I loved the story line..I am a fan of Jane Krakowski, and I think that this was one of her better roles..I liked her character, a emotional, yet determined woman to become a mother..I can't imagine a better woman for the part..But of course, what made this movie, was Danielle Panabaker..She played an extraordinary part, and I think she played it wonderfully..She played a confused, scared single mother..It actually seemed like this was coming from a real 16 year old single mom..Most stories seem like they were written by a 35 year old male..This one was so well written, that you would think it came straight from a 16 year old girl's mind..It was definitely a great movie, that I would watch again in a heartbeat
Bruce Mitchell delivers an award-deserving performance as the believable, yet unpredictable Zap Rowsdower.
However..."The Blair Witch Project" (though I'm no fan) was low-budget yet has become a cult phenomenon.
"The Red Violin" had no big budget, yet was critically acclaimed.
And yet, when it appeared it was considered "smut" and there were widespread cries for censorship!!!
When we first saw it last year on TCM, our whole family literally busted out laughing uncontrollably, with tears coming from our eyes during the rapid-paced knight-certification scenes (and this is with somewhat-jaded teenagers yet!).
Asia has yet to prove, in my view, that she is anything but a one-note actress who plays every part and every scene as a possessed nymphette, and this script doesn't help.
The mother's eyes exuded such a deep sadness and yet so much love and patience.
The film touts Amanda as being "an ambitious young executive" who has a "busy career," yet all we see of her at her job gives the impression that she is nothing but a receptionist with nothing on her mind but her birthday and her boyfriend.
No video or a DVD release yet.
are we having fun yet?"
Wizards of the Demon Sword was made during a period rife with extremely bad sword and sorcerer movies, yet it has the dubious distinction of being about the worst I've thus far run across.
Apparently everyone is well aware Fantine is going to die, yet they go about their day ever-so-happily.
Given over to LaLaLand, this would have been yet another throwaway melodrama drenched in its own soapiness.
So trite, the way they yet again use the unfunny, stone-faced Leningrad Cowboys as some kind of sorry comic relief.
Scenes like the old man being stabbed on the wooden barge, while everyone on shore watches on and yet no one notices what just happened.
I think I watched every single episode of it and whenever an episode was over I thought "this show sucks", yet, I always came back.
They apparently pose a deep threat to the twosome, yet no attempts at escape entail.
Russell is one of those actresses who is capable of delivering a performance that evokes laughter and yet tugs at your heartstrings.
Little did I know all he had was a very brief cameo in the film, yet it was enough for them to advertise his name all over the listings.
In addition, the first twenty minutes of the film where Keaton sneaks about town doing 'hitmanny stuff' is all very well arranged and is admittedly kind of cool - yet this twenty minutes does not in any way reflect the tone nor the level of quality you should expect from the rest of the film following it.
It says here that "Allan W. Steeve is an alias for Alain Deruelle, yet also lists the films co-star, Olivier Mathot, as well as Spanish actor Julio PÃ©rez Tabernero, as additional uncredited directors.
There are Asians, Caucasians, skinny guys, fat guys, little boys and hippies with porkchop sideburns, yet oddly just one female tribe member to populate the entire village.
John Goodman is an exceptional actor, yet he can't save this turkey.
Rosie O'Donnell gives a stiff, and yet somehow melodramatic performance.
THE VALET, however, played as yet another string in the long ball of yarn that is the rapidly dwindling comedy genre.
Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).
The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his 'death', then rail against him when exposed.
Let me start by saying I have never had the urge to make a comment on IMDb yet - not for a great movie, and certainly not for a bad one.
Both comedians contemplate about how they made the same kinds of movie, played the same kinds of stupid people, yet Sandler is still a high commodity and Shore isn't.
Pauly Shore has found yet another device to irritate people.
Sample these:  - pigeon flight contests (or kabootar baazi, a flock breaking pigeons mid flight from a rival flock) - Indian hop scotch (ikkal dukkal) - the earthen stove (or choolha) - the custom of eating with hands in the kitchen on the floor near choolha - the custom of offering for a saint's shrine (nazar at durgaah) - the custom of arranged marriage between Muslim cousins - the custom of purdah, - the custom of eating betel leaf (or paans) and hookah smoking - the tradition of sellers of bangles and shawls coming home - the incompetent contemptible and indolent nawabs who would sell part of the estate for a courtesan  See old Umrao if you have not yet; see it again if you have once.
The deaths are some sick stuff - yet MGM showed it with a 16 rating!
I've been watching the last 2 seasons wondering when the're going to do something unpredictable or at least something noteworthy of how the show used to be, and yet nothing's happened.
I don't know, maybe you have to be American to actually like this (not meant to offend, it's just different culture and state of mind than European) but I have yet to find someone I know that actually like this show.
Robotic and/or hysterical acting, moronic plot contortions, and enough deep shadow (in Miami, yet) to make Edgar Ulmer spin like a top.
Forced by necessity and desperation Maggie does something that is at first utterly alien to her, but may yet become an awakening and salvation, a route to an identity she does not know she has and to new love.
Locked away in the vaults of every film studio are negatives from some truly quality horror and cult films that have yet to see a proper DVD release.
I consider this merely because the only audience this film seems aimed at are fans of graphically displayed and unabashedly lewd sex acts, yet since this film doesn't quite go the XXX distance, it seems silly that anyone in that demographic would seek this out instead of opting for a purely pornographic offering.
Thanks for listening, and I'm off to prepare myself mentally for entering the third installment, undoubtedly yet another epic tale of mind-boggling barbaric fantasy, called DEATHSTALKER AND THE WARRIORS FROM HELL.
You seem to be well-educated, yet not bright enough to simply ignore network crap.
Some of the parts, I just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have dosed off yet, from my experience from taking Martial arts.
Those days are long since gone and yet some people feel compelled to keep the "exotic Asia" myth alive in film and literature and this film is one such example.
Forever the publicity hound, Crawford presents her happy family in the most pretentious manner in front of the Hollywood press, yet hides a streak of cruelty that manifests itself into military-like parenting and savagely violent episodes.
After Massai shoots at least two of his people, only minutes later, those trying to subdue him just let him walk away--yet he just killed two people!!!!
And yet, there are people and critics who rate this film quite highly.
They aren't there yet - Bennett is unspectacular and Brown's shrieks are more annoying than funny; later, he would successfully refine his comic persona.
well i do recommend SLC Punk if you haven't yet seen it.
I have yet to watch the extra "80 minutes" on disc 2.
Or better yet, go home and masturbate to a picture of yourself.
For anyone reading this who hasn't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money.
Better yet those who read this nonsense and throw millions of dollars around in order to make sure it happens.
Life for Adam consists of doing his farm chores, courting his sweetheart Ruth Simmons (Meredith Salenger), daughter of Joseph Simmons (Robert Urich), and desperately trying to win the approval of his gruff, temperamental yet good-hearted father Moses (Tommy Lee Jones - before he was ultra-famous).
Since this was the dawn of the age of the slasher film, they didn't quite get the formula down yet.
Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch).
Most of these men are reluctant warriors, resigned to an unpleasant task, yet resolved to carry it through.
A fine illustration of the ultimate Check and Balance of an armed citizenry; a concept enshrined in our Constitution yet too readily dismissed by many who claim to believe in democratic principles.
I'm a huge fan of most of his films like 'The Addiction', 'Bad Lieutenant' and 'The Funeral'ÂIt's not that I didn't like 'the Driller Killer', I just think that the poor production values really show off and that Ferrara did not yet had the professionalism and talent to make up for it by adding the trademarks that made his later films so brilliant.
), the ending is changed, all the scenes describing their courtship are cut and replaced with badly sung musical numbers, and yet Mercutio feels the need to constantly quote other Shakespeare plays!
I find it necessary to qualify my above remarks, as well as those I have not yet written down, by saying I do not object to raunchy, low-brow humor.
If you are not yet familiar with the general set-up of Step Brothers through the movie's excessively aggressive and ubiquitous marketing campaign, it is rather simple.
Worse yet, is that the two lead characters' quirks are made less interesting by the supporting characters in the movie.
If you haven't seen those two episodes yet then you must, they are pure comic genius with Hasselhoff playing Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth, with a ridiculously massive fake stuck on beard!, classic.
Marc John Jefferies is cute, yet Gyllenhaal barely even plays on this, amazingly.
Racial issues throughout are intriguing yet sadly never fully examined.
It's satisfying to see the original director and cast returning for this sequel, yet they sadly fail to recapture the mood of the first film, and "Pat" Morita is not as impressive this time either.
Bill Conti brings his initial score back too, and the film is well shot, yet it fails to really uplift and entertain its audience.
Bullets are flying left and right, and corpses just pile up, yet it takes ages for people to hear the bullets or realize the direness of any of a number of situations with the random shooting.
Besides, how can you feel any backing for a man who is supposed to be a security chief, yet fails to stop the villains from massacring nearly every passenger on the boat?
Not to be confused with the earlier and slightly better The Slumber Party Massacre, with which it shares several similarities (a house full of teenage girls, a psycho killer, a virginal heroine, the word 'Massacre' in its title), Sorority House Massacre is yet another routine 80s stalk 'n' slash thriller, with a little Nightmare on Elm Street dream nonsense thrown in to try and spice things up a little.
Sorority House Massacer is yet another cheap low budget piece of crap from executive producer Roger Corman's New Concorde Pictures, I sat there openly willing it to finish I was that bored.
I don't know about Bejing, haven't been there yet.
This documentary will be frustrating to anyone who is already done with the US war policy, but it will help assuage those not yet ready to admit they made a mistake when they voted for Bush.
He seems to have an ego that would anger Kevin Federline and uses pick-up lines that are beyond corny, yet he does appear to score with women.
and yet despite being made 7 years on (when effects have supposed to have improved) 'The deadly spawn' makes this film look like a college exam entry.
You're better off downloading it, or better yet, don't watch it at all.
Hero is standing here in front of 6 masked bad guys letting off a hail of Uzi fire, yet he seems to find 5 minutes to drop his gun and tearfully look at children/ friends/ loved ones falling over in slow motion as violin music cuts in over the background.
Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.
And this one has it all--very bad acting, the director's stripper wife making yet another gratuitous appearance in one of his films, non-existent writing and terrible direction (with quite a few out of focus and poorly framed shots).
This film ran on the Sundance Channel last night, and after watching less than ten minutes of it, i knew I was in the presence of yet another poorly written, embarrassingly acted piece of TLA crap.
I watch a load of independent movies, many with budgets much lower than this film had, and I have yet to see such a badly written, badly directed, badly made and woefully badly acted dud as this.
It's incredible to note that, despite his failing health, some of Karloff's best work - Roger Corman's THE RAVEN (1963), Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963) and Peter Bogdanovich's TARGETS (1968) - was yet ahead of him!
PROJECT X was very familiar and yet, thanks to the look of the movie, very outdated too.
DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funny  This is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similar  The comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage like  The spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrived  The ending is the worst part of the film  Direction by DD is bad Music is ordinary  Camera-work is only saving grace  Amongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly
No explanation was ever given for his bizarre costume or for his inability to find his way to the right lesson, and yet this detail seemed perfectly at one with the mood of the film.
One of those high-budget, yet relentlessly schlocky movie-star vehicles which both pander and condescend to a mass audience; the pedigree talent involved may well warrant a viewing, yet the film is so pompous it makes viewers feel like chumps for watching.
They had time to include this garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?
), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair mussed, how cliche!
I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything Clancy has previously done.
It's a common worry that terrorist groups might get ahold of a low yield fission "suitcase" bombs, yet right from the start in the movie no one, including the President, suspects terrorists!
In case you know yet nothing about the film, you're tempted to think this will be an artsy and tasteful exploitation feature.
Lassie takes a real beating in this one (including harsh owners, icy, raging rivers and bad weather of all sorts), yet, oddly, much of the focus is on doctor Edmund Gwenn and the wet-eyed, hand-wringing families of his patients.
During the credits we see a yet unknown nun in confession.
Noted for its blending the "Nunsploitation" genre with the typical Giallo formula, these elements ought in fact to have made for a doubly enticing proposition; yet the two styles never properly jell, so that the film is too often ludicrous as opposed to gripping (much less scathing).
This movie is nothing like that movie, yet it is exactly the same; and this is why.
This reeked of a bomb, yet I had to watch it because Dennis Rodman movies always provide that so bad it's good theme going for them.
DAREDEVIL is yet another bad comic-book-movie in a long line of bad comic-book-movies.
The acting is poor, yet not unwatchable.
Obviously she didn't know yet, she was still gathering clues and thought she was going insane!!
Confidential' was a longer and more complex book than Ellroy's 'The Black Dahlia', yet Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland knew what was necessary to move the story forward without getting in 'over their heads' in making it a functional screenplay.
It reminds me of bad sitcoms where things are too zany for anyone to just continue on trying to be normal, and yet they do.
It's not too high on the chick flick scale, yet it's still high enough to be watched with that special someone.
A sequel to one of the greatest, most powerful horror films of all time, yet one without the input of original director and co-writer David Cronenberg, was always going to be a hard sell.
I wasn't impressed by Zeta-Jones yet and this movie didn't improve it.
While the US was not yet in the war when the film was made, WWII was in full swing and only a group of idiots wouldn't have guessed what was really occurring!
If I have to give my advice to someone who didn't see it yet: DON'T WATCH IT!
The cover made it look like The Devils Rejects, the opening credits (images and choice of songs) made it look like The Hills Have Eyes, yet this movie wasn't like either.
How can this movie be banned in 43 countries, yet have ZERO amount of gore until the last 10 minutes?
It amazes me how they can write that this film was the most "horrific and disturbing film in years" and "banned in 43 countries" yet give no sources or credits.
The center of the plot has to do with a large diamond everybody is looking for, yet at the end we are never quite sure if it was found or not.
See it at Blockbuster before the Summer Blockbusters open, better yet rent it if you were given a gift card from a friend.
The elephants are both supposed to be boys, yet the younger brother, TuTu, is obviously performed by a woman trying to sound like a child.
Regardless, the classification of this film as "comedy-drama" should have been the tip-off that whenever Ms Griffith found herself in trouble, the baby-doll would pop out, coo sickeningly, and her character would survive for yet another stunning costume change.
Now, the "serious" side of this movie flounders like the fully dressed blacks diving into the pool--we're supposed to think here of baptism, even before we see the image of the little boy floating in the crucifixion pose--and we are also supposed to swallow yet another screenwriter's slam-dunk of a terribly complex and many-sided situation, that of racial injustices of sixties Alabama.
You would think the setup of a volcano blowing up at a remote, yet crowded location, leaving a handful of survivors to fend for themselves until they can be safely rescued would be a good one.
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
It provides an interesting insight into one of Australia's most notoriously tight-knit surf cultures, yet the Abberton influence raises questions of bias regarding the various events which envelop his brothers.
As it is Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead (1982) or Dog Soldiers (2002), I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror.
I did not have high expectations for "Paganini Horror" as fellow Horror lovers had already warned me about how ridiculously bad it was, yet I somehow wished I was in for a positive surprise, since director Luigi Cozzi is generally a gifted man, as films like his highly unusual, but equally highly memorable Giallo "The Killer Must Kill Again" (1975) prove.
And yet the direction is fairly tight, the locales are interesting, and the movie is engrossing almost in spite of itself.
yet to the mexican police it is a challenge.
Well, here we go with yet another John Lithgow loser.
And, what's worse, a couple of them are running about with no shirt on--and yet their skin isn't even pink!!
At one point the head "survivalist guy" Sam, says "it's not over yet" but you'll sure wish it was.
2 Cultural differences can't be overcome so easily, trust has to be won, yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders.
There is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING!
If you haven't watched it yet - save yourself the time.
Or better yet, spend some time and read the book.
The plot seems to be standard enough yet, like diamonds in the rough, there are these priceless sequences that make no sense and can cause great episodes of hilarity.
Luckily Justin Stanley and Eric Miller the writers are seriously inept, yet their blunder has inadvertently created a wonder.
The aliens can be clearly seen still standing around, alive and well, yet for some strange reason the family and Stockwell think they will all be safe from that point on.
Usually when Woody borrows an idea from Bergman he makes that idea his own, and turns it into something that's clever yet funny and entertaining.
It's a wonder this film hasn't shown up on cable yet.
For example, this movie is supposed to be set in India, yet all of the Indian characters speak English...when talking to each other!
Better yet, BUY every copy you can find, both the VHS and the DVD (I guarantee you this will be in the El Cheapo Clearance Dump Bins all over the world), and destroy them to spare the rest of humanity from this atrocity...
Next week, Rose is supposed to drop yet another bomb on poor Simon.
I've noticed most people who defend this show are Christians, and as much as I'd love to do some well-placed bashing, I won't, because I happen to have a lot of friends who are Christians and yet laugh themselves silly at the idiocy that is "7th Heaven".
In one scence, a girl hangs herself, yet no-one around her, acts to help her, were they either fleeing or looking at her corpse hanging there.
In another scence, a lone police officer is busy searching for missing girls, yet strange enough, when he is killed, it seems he is not missed at all.
The reviews had this as one of the Top 10 films of 2004, but yet the story was disjointed, not very interesting and just overall not entertaining.
The trees all communicate through synapses, and this is supposed to be ominous, yet this never turns into anything compelling.
If you want to see a stupid "action" movie, with indestructible heroines and yet more effects-enhanced extreme sports crap thrown in to appeal to those who actually care, this is the movie for you.
Another thing that drove me insane is that these girls are suppose to be intelligent and yet they keep acting stupid in every scene that we see them in.
In the end, which I am yet to see completely, her power linked with those of two other school girls, keeps three ancient witches from doing something nasty, like swapping bodies or something equally bad.
I just could not endure the sight of Mr Connery getting back into bed yet again with Ms Cannon, the half-hearted fawning of a supposedly gay Mr Balsam [didn't know it was possible to underact a gay stereotype] and as for the direction and focus of the film I an only guess that Mr Lumet had other things on his mind.
I have yet to figure out the comparison.
The main interest lies, predictably enough, with Catherine Deneuve, in yet another mid-life crisis role.
And yet, the final half-hour actually works.
Understand that I have watched such films to its conclusion as one with guys in gorilla costumes doing kung fu and their masters using their three foot tongues as weapons--yet I just couldn't finish BOLO.
i still have yet to see the whole thing again.
Obviously the producers had money and spent it on hiring a great casting director, who was well connected... and yet all the actors signed on to something that was absolute crap... did they even SEE any of the animation before it was being voiced?
From Python to this, it's so SAD to witness his scenes...  Of course, we have Jaden Smith, at yet another ANNOYING scenery chewing piece of child performance, that makes you roll your eyes in disbelief.
Cruise, at this time, had yet to hone the persona upon which he would build his career.
The comments already placed cite MJ as a 'freak' 'weirdo' and sexual deviant and yet these comments come from people who lives in areas where guys are now permitted to marry other guys, men change sex to women and George Bush to get another term as president.
Some people, I believe, who have not yet been forced to accept the bitter corporate pill of PC behaviour may suggest that MJ is not so weird and freakish as the above.
It all boils down to a satisfying, yet open, climax and overall; despite its problems getting a release - this is a damn good horror film and will surely rank as one of the best of 2006!
This is yet another of those hastily-cobbled-together botched jobs that appeared between the mid 1970's and mid 1980's.
The people are there, the money's there, yet one grips your attention whilst the other sends you to sleep.
He helps each through the tough times and yet at the end of the day, he too had to deal with own hurts and rejections.
yet for some reason I've become slightly obsessed with British culture, movies, literature, music and whatnot.
And yet for some mysterious reason used to not spend as much as they do now.
), and then continuing spending what money you don't even have yet.
It also has its occasional 'Carry On' moments, yet, still, the bawdy pen of Talbot Rothwell would not have saved this effort.
But yet, when he gets in front of a camera for a movie, everything seems to go wrong.
It had so much promise, yet the comedy was either badly written (if written at all) or the actors just could not deliver it.
Returning to the car chase, Bullitt's car chase might be in some people's the best car chases list, but if you ask me, we have seen much better car chases and I want to give a few examples, also I am sure that there are more car chases that I can't remember or haven't seen yet.
The acting is good, and Depp is...well he's different than how you usually see him, and yet the same - he always gets a part in those mystical movies.
So very original and interestingÂ But what really annoyed me is the way the movie managed to brake just about every basic "zombie rule" that there is: 1) zombie's never run - but they do here, 2) zombies do not understand languages - but they do understand English here, 3) zombies cannot be trained (like dogs) - but here they can, 4) zombies cannot be trained to be selective about whom they attack, for they are indiscriminate about whom they want to rip to pieces and eat - yet here the zombies are trained to attack their trainer's enemies, and, 5) uninfected, non-zombie humans should not be dumber than their distant zombie relatives - but in this movie the zombies aren't the main idiots.
She knew that she had been treated wrongly, yet she murdered in cold blood.
If anyone had touched HIS kids in a sexual way, he would have wanted to kill them, yet he allowed his personal sexual needs to take advantage of a teen girl.
Neither phrase, "inner city" nor "South Bronx" had yet been invented.
Vin Diesel didn't talk in the first one yet he does so in this film and that's not a good thing.
The special effects are done really well yet sometimes they go overboard with them.
It's not a fast-moving film yet it is an involving story in which the viewer winds up caring about these people.
To be able to give so much and yet still be denied the love and understanding of the very people you have helped so much.
This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
As a UK citizen, I had never had the misfortune to see an episode of this 'talk show' as it was on digital and I haven't upgraded yet.
I was hoping against hope that perhaps Letterman's interview technique was second to none, but yet again I was disappointed: they are as vapid and un-illuminating as the rest of the show.
Later, Oliver Hardy has one nice piece of volte-face acting when he barges into a room, all bombast and bluster, then he instantaneously morphs into a courtly gent (resembling the 'Ollie' of Hal Roach films yet to come) when he sees there's a lady in the room.
The novel on which it is based is, sadly perhaps, too complex and long to adapt to the screen without sacrificing some aspect of the many subplots it contains, and although I regret the loss of the radical political dimension, the subtle and heart-wrenching way loneliness, racism, impoverishment, snobbery, and disadvantage are conveyed are so powerfully treated that the end result is a film of almost unbearable sadness and melancholy... and yet... And yet there is an element of tremendous hope also at work; of the human spirit overcoming huge odds and learning life's lessons as the various characters go along and work out their individual destinies.
It seems quite churlish to excuse a novice director's first feature-length outing (especially when you have not yet made one), and since this director, Marfield, was introduced at "Deepwater's" SIFF screening this past June, his direct and humble appearance made it a film you wanted to like.
At it's heart, "Deepwater" is a very conventional neo-noir exercise in style, and yet it's so luridly over embellished and so relentlessly over plotted (none of it's excess with any plausible purpose or destination) that it just becomes one ridiculously defiled, incoherent mess.
This movie was rated R back in 1977 and after viewing it, I have yet to find out why.
None of the torpedoes hit the sub, even though no decoys are fired, and yet the sub still takes hits.
The bad guys come and go, yet, Vickie is able to avoid being shot, or have her hair messed during the worst of the action.
The father dies and yet there is no funeral, no goodbye, no closure: cut next scene mother getting hammered again, brother moping around depressed.
The family is devoid of morals or values, and yet they lead an idyllic existence.
There is little or no emotion between them, yet we are asked to believe that they are as close and loving a family as ever lived.
Every character that impacts on their lives seems construed to be as unlikely as people can be, and yet there are so many of them in this one story.
No explanation is given as to why the head thug has amazing seductive powers over women, without even saying a word, yet it seems every female character falls madly in love with him.
Or better yet they were both working to become dental  hygienists and Frances McDormand's character worked with  bands that never really quite made it rather than Bowie, Iggy,  Springsteen...and the record release party was at a dive rather  than that penthouse suite...
I can't believe that they have been repressed for that whole time and yet well adjusted enough to build a relationship together.
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
The first and last stories are watchable, yet the quality level never surpasses your average 'Tales from the Crypt' episode or something.
The whole thing is completely ruined by bad (and too much) pop/rock music that form yet another connection between the stories.
The great cast is a reason to watch the film, and yet expectations should be kept low - The film is among the least memorable in either of the three Horror stars' repertoires, and the beautiful Miss Ekland has only a very small role.
The visibly aged stars, Carradine and Price are far from their best, and yet it is them who make the film a lot more worthwhile, especially Price brings in some great wit more than once.
Amicus Studio's death-rattle, and a homage to the 1970s glory years of its portmanteau horrors, if The Monster Club has accrued a certain cult status it's mostly down to its sheer awfulness; yet, bafflingly, The Monster Club, adapted from Chetwynd-Hayes' 1976 novel of the same name, does in fact boast a highly experienced and occasionally impressive pedigree.
But it hadn't yet been shown to be effective in war.
The movie was made in 1940 and several references are made to the war in Europe, but America had not yet joined in, so there's no combat flying.
Still, there are interesting moments including a training and competition mission where the new pilot compounds an error and ends up tangled in a cloth target sleeve which nearly causes him to crash yet another plane.
This is nothing new and yet still had potential to be something great if the writing and acting and all the elements came together but they didn't and as a result, this movie was average at best.
End of another great Corman film, and the end of yet another few of my brain cells.
Oddly, you do wonder why the Enterprise could figure all this out so quickly and yet the folks on the planet were totally screwed!
She knew this little weirdo for what, two minutes, and yet the writers felt the need to make a pitiful little montage of their "precious moments" at the very end.
It is hard to decide which element of this film is the worst: the acting, which is stiff, yet glistening with the desperation of young, hungry actors trying to find meaning in this piece of dreck; the writing, in which the aching banality is broken up only by the sense of irritation that is the inevitable outcome of listening to the ill-considered opinions of dullards; or the cinematography, which is flat, insipid and unattractive.
Farrow does a wonderful job as a vulnerable and frail Cecilia, who wants adventure and yet fears it at the same time.
Chris Seaver strikes me as a kind of juvenile troll who thinks his low budget antics give homage to Ed Wood's ineptness, but I believe he's so bereft of talent yet has such a swollen ego that he can't distinguish the difference.
This is easily the most appalling release from Full Moon yet.
For the uninformed movie watcher it would serve as a strong, yet grossly misleading, deterrent against pot use.
Though it is overwhelmingly bad, it was just a tester screening and they may yet make changes to this piece.
In this movie it looks like she is desperately trying to recreate being stoned, funny and yet still managing to be cute while clinging desperately to a mid-20 something youthfulness.
There is usually a convoluted, yet complicated story arc or a ridiculously easy plot masquerading as convoluted one.
With the exception of Punch Drunk Love (an entirely different kind of role altogether) and to a lesser extent, Spanglish, I have yet to see Sandler actually pull off a massively hilarious or worthwhile comedy ever since.
Billy Madison was by far the funniest, and it's been downhill since then, with The Longest Yard being his worst comedy yet.
Cooper's Welcome to My Nightmare album was a classic, and his supporting tour was amazing, yet the video documenting that tour is downright awful.
If only the concert had been filmed with higher quality equipment, it just might have been his best video release yet.
yet turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
CatonÂJones will not raise above the level of his own BASIC INSTINCT 2 and THE JACKALÂstarÂvehicles, essentially derivative and exploitative; only that CITY BY THE SEA is below those, and yet another wasting of a De Niro performance (--though CatonÂJones is not alone to blameÂas De Niro himself looks rather uncooperative--).
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
The Williams murder trial made public an open secret, that a gay world existed behind the facades of the southern mansions and it was discreetly apparent, quietly tolerated, yet never, never discussed.
Are we having fun yet?
The XXX version at least stood for something and was an original idea taken to it's logical extreme; It is filth for sure, yet at least the filmmakers had the guts to get down there in the trenches with their viewers.
Ed Wood's movies became classics because they were so earnest, yet so genuinely bad that they became funny.
Add to that conversations that are supposed to be 'real' yet are clearly not a part of the 'internal documentary,' and some poorly acted and staged scenes that are meant to illuminate the tale of Wenders' trip to Ray's bedside, while also trying and failing to break down narrative conventions, and you have a genuine disasterÂ.
The main character played by Crow is quite happy to murder law enforcement and his own gang members with nothing shorter than that of a psychopath yet fluctuates back and forth in wanting to help and feel sorry for his captor and son.
As Christian Bale says, "I've been asking God to help me for three years and he hasn't done it yet."
His performance isn't bad--and Haskell is careful not to overdo the wild-eyed bit--yet the picture takes mere surface-swipes at its own possibilities.
The intro states there isn't any type of vegetation on our planet any more, yet a couple of sequences later the characters are playing cat- and-mouse right next to a crystal clear lake surrounded with beautifully green plants.
There is not a word invented yet that describes how absolutely horrible this is.
Better yet check out Savage Instinct by Troma Pictures.
Luminous Farrow is at her most vulnerable, and writer-director Woody Allen allows her to be funny too, yet the film is a preconceived, bittersweet whimsy about dashed dreams; it's ready-made to collapse.
This is by far one of the most complex yet well written Woody Allen flicks.
Among them, Shandling character was able to copulate infinitely, yet it didn't seem like he himself had any sort of orgasm.
Yeah, so you think its going to be a bunch of predators and a bunch of aliens whoopin each others asses... well its not.... its 3 predators.... and you don't see them or the aliens until after the first hour of humans walking around this temple confused and lost with pointless dialogue and this "I'm going to touch stuff that I don't know what it does yet" frame of mind...  when the 3 predators finally show up.. your thinking YES... carnage is coming... the reason I came to see this movie.... well...
Well, no, sorry boys and girls... the predator just starts his little arm bomb and throws it on the ground and him and girl run to safety together... Wow, that was easy huh... Why bother spawning hundreds of aliens to battle if your entire crew is full of losers who can't fight, and your just going to nuke the entire site anyway... bleh...  but its not over yet!
Sure, they smell a little, and there isn't much cloth yet, but I can't just throw them away!
You may have noticed that I haven't said anything about the actual characters yet, apart from mentioning Lance Henriksen by his own name rather than that of the character.
The stories were so uncomplicated yet incredibly well written that the viewer could not possibly complain that the story was bad.
Why did they decide to put the F word in earlier when it wasn't necessary, yet cut it out later when it was?!
If they had of just shifted the F word to the ugly mother part then there could have been just as many F words yet still kept the trademark line!
Her new love interest is a lifeless doctor who smiles at her maybe twice in the film, yet somehow falls for her.
It wasn't cool, dramatic, or interesting the first time and yet it kept happening, as if it were the most dramatically meaningful thing that ever happened.
I also carry in my mind a (slight mis-)quote from the end of episode one which I am still waiting for Jack Bristow to say; it sort of sums up the experience so far in this show where nothing is as it seems yet everything is totally predictable - "Sydney, I'm not your father, I'm your mother".
There is a back story for the Goucem's (main character) mother (Bouyane) to be seriously afraid from fundamentalists and you know it has something to do with her past as a singer and dancer, yet you do not have hint of what really happened.
He seems to be infatuated with Goucem, yet we never know why and how it started.
For example, they employ an ex soaps director to direct the live broadcast, yet he not only does not accompany them to their live broadcast, he is basically left out of the film entirely.
Michael York, sporting a thick crop of cinnamon-colored hair and talking with a Limey accent, plays the visiting celebrity with a snide kind of casual indifference, which is perfectly right for the character, but it does nothing for the audience and he elicits little interest; Rita Tushingham (reunited with York from 1967's "Smashing Time") overworks her perky nature and large, round eyes, yet her character hasn't been given many dimensions beyond what we are made to quickly sense (that her aimlessness led her to India and what she really needs is a man in her bed).
As directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant--who would become long-time partners and filmmakers--"The Guru" isn't bad; the locations are great and there are intermittent bits of satire that are certainly fashionable (for 1969, especially), yet ultimately there is too much ambiance and not enough plot.
Nothing really matters at this point, and yet we have another (drawn-out and totally useless) half-an-hour to go.
Whereas Night Shift is a parody and shows some pretense towards the normal but abnormalities of living in a big city, yet does so with pure improvised humor, the type that leaves you rolling on the floor laughing literally so, by the movies end.
George Bancroft, Betty Compson, and Olga Baclanova are all great is this cynical yet tender story of the waterfront.
It wants to be cool yet wants to be scary and fails miserably at both.
Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place.
And if I had wasted my money to go see this in the movies, I'd asked for a refund...No,no,no better yet...
It's a silly, low-budget piece of trash, and yet it doesn't diminish any respect I might have had for Asia Argento, the writer, director, and star.
A nice balance is struck between his craziness as Bill and Winkler's calm, yet clumsy and likable Chuck.
My fiancÃ©e(who has aided me in several other recent reviews of mine) and I watched this last night, and the quality was so low, we decided to write a review of it together... to warn off anyone lucky enough to not have watched it yet.
But don't waste your money on yet another film attempting to exploit the goofy white people, which has been done for years on end.
However Federal Agents step in & forbid the killing of any Graboids due to the endangered species act which gives them the opportunity to become Shriekers & then after that stage they transform into yet another different type of creature which Burt has to deal with...
We see the seedy side of life yet we're given little explanation why Stahl and his friends are so belligerent against hope, without any imagination or the drive to get out and succeed.
Then, in the last story when he was going to cut off Norman's finger in some sick bet Chester, Leo and Norman made he had no problem yet he couldn't even have sex with the women in the beginning of the movie and was throwing up all over the place in the Misbehavors.
Can't believe no one used that summery line yet.
And, this guy is hit over the head by two lamps and a glass dish, is stabbed through the leg with a fireplace poker, with his eyes doused with floor cleaner, yet the girls still can not subdue him!
If you haven't gotten the picture yet, this is, by far, the absolute worst of the series.
I mean, making an upbeat, easygoing (yet still R-rated) comedy about prostitution would seem like a crazy thing to do.
This is the type of trial case that makes the news and is a one-in-a-million-type ordeal--you'd see it advertised everywhere in big bold print--yet the movie approaches it as if it's an everyday event in the life of a judge.
yet another example of hollywood being totally out touch with how to make GOOD movies.
and yet another example of an editing team/studio thinking they can cut and chop a movie to make it something it wasn't intended to be (a boring art house flick, not an action movie).
I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie, but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet.
The rest of his lines are as inept as "John Steed... what a horse's a**e of a name", yet he manages to hold some modicum of dignity dressed as a giant teddy bear.
Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad.
I have yet to see a decent movie from a "San Antonio Filmmaker".
It had a great cast and the director of "Down with Love" (a bitter, yet hilarious romantic comedy) and "Bring It On" (a hip, edgy teen comedy) behind it?
This movie seemed like a sure bet and yet it just doesn't work.
"The Good Girl' was so good but yet made no more than her previous attempts in film work (I would imagine rentals put her over the top because rentals are rented mainly based on consumer 'word of mouth').
Save this one for DVDÂ and even then, wait for it to be taken off the "new releases" wall so you don't have to pay as much for it, or better yet, maybe you'll get lucky and your library will carry it and you will be able to pay NOTHING for itÂ which is basically what it's worth.
And the plot itself a bit ridiculous, considering that her bandmate gets raped, another bandmate descends into serious drug abuse, and yet another bandmate dies in a freak accident-- all within the span of like a week.
There's something pleasingly surreal, and yet accurate, about it; it's perfectly paced and the acting is faultless.
And yet, so what?
In general slow and predictable, a bore to watch, and if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time.
How any would-be stand up comic could keep trying to be funny, and yet be so patently unfunny, and for so long, is beyond me; I've seen my share of mediocre comedians, but they all pale in comparison to Jimmy, whose depressing routines consist of what appear to be confessionals, centered around his miserable existence.
Lou Gossett Jr. is a less than patient fellow cop and Anthony Zerbe is Matthau's crusty yet benign superior.
Ranks mattered, and people behaved accordingly -- the passionate yet meek Jane and the moody yet tractable Mr. Rochester never forget their stations, and that influences their interactions.
She seems to think that Jane is some feminist archetype, bold and sassy...when in reality Jane, because of years of oppression at Lowood knew "her place" yet, was so good, she answered Edward's questions truthfully...even if her answers seemed bold.
The characters are unique and nuanced, the story lines complex and resolutions often unexpected yet always genuine.
The characters are unique and nuanced, the story lines complex and resolutions often unexpected yet always genuine.
DRAGON likewise created its own distorted "reality," with yet another wannabe look-alike choreographed through yet more over-the-top, badly done fight scenes that did nothing more than add yet another layer of tarnish to the memory of a man who deserves better.
Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an "NC-17" rating).
), yet somehow we have a happy ending.
Robert Forster, fresh off his canceled television stint in the short-lived 1974 "NAKIA", proves a credible character as an environmentalist who foresees the inevitable disaster, yet cannot convince a soul to believe or listen to him.
Here, rescue workers scramble to rescue the child using a safety net below, yet the man that is left dangling spends about three minutes complaining that he cannot 'let go' and when he finally does (as a result of getting electrocuted), his lifeless body misses the safety net anyway!
Unlike Jerry and Sally June and Rocky didn't fall for Nick's boastful promises of making them rich and famous, or better yet infamous.
It is partially effective, but it ultimately becomes basically yet another one of them thar soap opries, replete with hokey dialogue.
Elliott Gould is bemused and colorful as a Vietnam veteran back in college, stuck between a rock and a hard place; he's working semi-seriously towards getting his teaching credentials, and yet is stymied by his fellow classmates who want to protest the hypocrisies of the Establishment (with Gould's help), and also by his instructors, hypocrites with power who work by a double standard.
Gould's shaggy character rants and raves too, but his Harry Bailey presents a different problem: he cheats, he lies, he cuts corners, he heartily embraces his own set of values and yet is happily corrupt!
She's continually put down for that, as if she's a sell-out, and yet how exactly would Gould live if he were to achieve his dream of being a high school teacher?
Terrifying yet they command your empathy.
Mary Crow Dog described hellishly turbulent times in the book, yet the movie glosses over them.
If you haven't seen this flick yet and want to (though if you do, I feel very sorry for you, my friend), you may want to skip the next sentence and read on, cause I think I may be dropping a spoiler.
Not sold on it yet?
There are other bits & pieces that I didn't understand either like the 'dead' body Rosy shows Marvin under the drain cover at the start yet even though he takes photos of it it never mentioned or seen again, maybe I did miss something I don't know.
Maybe it would've been funny if he were really mean towards Scott, yet he acts like the nicest guy towards everybody else.
This is definitely one I recommend people pass by, or better yet, watch the previews and imagine what you think the movie was.
If he had made the kids' lives really hell, and this shown on the screen, it could have been both very funny and yet at the same time a poignant reminder of the responsibility of educators to ensure the welfare of their students.
Like last year's School for Scoundrels, Woodcock is yet another movie in which Billy Bob Thornton plays a violent dick (no pun intended) and fails to be anywhere near as funny as he should be, thanks to a sloppy, almost laugh-less script.
Set and filmed in a cheerless lower class district of Sydney, with its casting auditions held at various schools of that city for many of the younger featured players, the piece won an award at Cannes Junior, yet there is precious little to sustain viewer interest in most sequences, responsibility for this shortcoming falling upon Cameron's disjointed screenplay.
The majority of this movie takes place in broad daylight, under clear skies, in a forest full of roads... Sure, not the best setting in which to derive "scares", yet there are some excellently perpetrated scenes involving ominous and jolting ghost encounters in a genuinely - and dare I say - refreshing way!
A promising start, a plot that is interesting, some interesting act at the beginning... but hey, don't get yourself enjoying yet.
... when the network was carpet-bombing trailers that were possibly the least funny and interesting promos in the history of cinema -- does anyone else think, for instance, that the plummeting of the credibility and popularity of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire dates from Regis Philbin hawking "Bob's book" as having made a huge difference in his life, on the Millionaire set yet, among other network celebrities pretending that Bob Patterson was a genuine motivational speaker?
I don't understand how he wrote this, the same guy who writes his stand-up routine, yet the movie is so poor.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Lucio Fulci (one of the masters of Italian horror) routinley worked with scripts that were much worse than this one, yet consistently churned out movies that were 10 times better.
Have I made it yet?
As a result, this is just yet another bland indie entry mixing social criticism and coming of age stories.
I've been studying Burt Lancaster's career lately, trying to catch up on every film of his I hadn't already seen, yet I couldn't stick this one out quite to the end.
It looks too much like Yoshi, like a baby and the sad thing is that I have yet only talked about the dragon.
jeez, have i written enough lines yet?
All right, it is historically "accurate"; yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome.
Elisa Tovati is only sexy as Poppaea; yet she could have been much much better.
But what made me most angry in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable:  - the death of Poppaea and St Paul's talk with Nero at her dead body,   - Claudius' mention of the current conquest of Britannia on the feast and soon his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife much before his death),   - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother,   - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators,   - finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by Acte "Let us forgive him"  All in all, this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the Roman Empire.
Bateman's character adds little to the story yet receives major screen time.
Have to say this is one of the worse yet this year.
He saws women in half or drives spikes in their heads--and yet they are just fine after the trick is complete.
Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects.
We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of.
Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities?
Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work?
It starts off with a somewhat creepy yet overplayed idea of a twisted family...then it just turns to crap.
One girl stabs another (it's not a spoiler because nobody can possibly care enough about the plot to be disappointed when the predictable happens yet again) and apologizes...but she's kind of laughing when she does it.
His costume has received a lot of scorn, yet I find it impressive.
He'd have a lot of work to do, yet he could come up with something decent (apparently a lot of footage was cut, maybe part of it is worthwhile, maybe not).
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
However, this is yet another Golan-Globus-Cannon actioner that turns out awful.
The sole highlight (for me, anyway) among the mess was Sean Connery's lively portrayal of the Green Knight yet its not enough to rescue the movie.
But as in the case of most Hindi movies ,I was disappointed yet again.
The film is filled with wimpy guys doing Grease talk, mixed in with Bowery Boys and yet some harsh violence.
Heres where we get into spoilerville...  1) John is an excellent marksman, yet he manages to miss one dog randomly and hit a girls leg even though every other shot in the movie he makes is dead on.
4) At one point, this guy (yeah...i didn't care enough to remember his name) has 20 baying dogs on him as he rushes to the car, yet, finds time to take his jacket off (an attack PROTECTION jacket) before he gets in the car?
Or better yet, watch a good documentary instead (like "Grey Gardens", which is also playing this month on Sundance).
30 years later, the older and successful, yet lonely Gangster 55 (an excellent portrayal by Malcom McDowell) awaits the release of Freddie from prison.
I had a sneaking suspicion that Katia and David weren't even married, yet here they are, stripping off in the desert, revealing themselves in all their hairy, angular, bilaterally symmetrical splendor.
There are no real characterisations, yet parts of the movie hinge on the depth of the characters.
This was yet another weak video game based anime like Fatal Fury.
On the positive side, I admired the way Ophuls created (on the surface) a believable world of the rich, and yet had an awareness of the poorer people that surrounded it.
Planes are extremely overpowered and feel like something Man hasn't built yet.
There is mummy on the loose who kills a lot of people in an horrible way but yet no one seems to be worried about the fact that their friends getting killed.
Also note how Mia Farrow's credit appears early in the cast list, yet she has about four lines.
Dreck heaped upon dreck and topped with yet more dreck.
Maybe I should be happy that comedies featuring black leads are no longer trying to copy 'FRIDAY'(a great film,in my opinion) yet still they're gonna have to try harder than this.
if these people can't run with the big dogs, they need to accept it and move on.. and the judges and producers need to take an UNBIASED approach, instead of one thats tailor-made for primetime ratings, yet still dosen't deliver.
Our Transatlantic puritanical fundaMentalist Judaeo-Christian cousins (at least once removed) strike again, with yet another fear-mongering propagandist defecation.
There are few genuine scares, yet the film generates some definite frissons along the way: Lockwood, a mediocre pianist at best, suddenly playing a piece faultlessly in front of guests; the girl's spontaneous quotation from a poem she readily admits to being unfamiliar with; and, especially, her close encounter with an unseen entity (woken up by the piano mysteriously playing at night, we hear its lid being violently shut when she enters the room, followed by the camera's swift panning Â suggesting something had gone past her Â and then hushed voices plotting murder in the hallway).
Bernard Knowles directs a simple, but yet slightly engrossing picture that has a solid plot (if rather slow going), with a tight script and exceptional performances from the likes of James Mason and Barbara Mullen.
Andy's soft, wise and yet accessible personae is alive and well in this show.
Acted very well--not over the top, yet not apathetic.
A muddled plot, directed in an extremely middling manner by Norman Lee, yet distinguished by the vibrant Lilli Palmer in the lead role.
Leslie Banks (probably best known for the original "The Man Who Knew Too Much") plays a flamboyant villain, sophisticated yet evil, complete with goatee, cape, a foreign accent of some kind and a pet monkey.
Liberto Rabal gives a fine performance and Javier Bardem (of Jamon, Jamon and Boca a Boca), delivers yet another great acting achievement.
If you are not confused yet, it gets more interesting as secrets are exposed.
Years later they meet when they give blood to their real mother (they don't know that yet).
Having always been a fan of both, I may be a bit biased, but most fans will agree with me that the two play wonderful villains, yet evoke a certain pity when they get theirs.
The third tale of the trilogy, "Escape Route," is probably the most like the classic "Twilight Zone," dark and brooding; yet least successful as a thriller.
she taunts him during yet another breakup).
Indeed, this delectably dreadful dreck was paired with the equally atrocious, yet somehow oddly endearing dippy hippie terror trip-out "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" on a twice-the-tacky-terror twin feature offering that must have caused anyone who saw them together to either make an immediate beeline for the exit door 15-odd minutes into the first film or slump into their seats in a comatose stupor after the ending credits of the second picture finished rolling.
His character gets very little time on screen, and yet, due to his acting, you find out more about him than any of the leads.
Even the tried-and-trusted routines don't work here: Bill Nighy is just irritating as he tries to splutter some life into unfunny dialogue while Timothy Spall does his dishevelled hamster shtick yet again, while the amateur musical used as a backdrop for the planned prison break seems simply amateurish and unfunny.
It wasn't even a concept yet at the time Blair was a rookie.
Wing Commander is a senseless, unfunny, yet satirical look at naval war movies and all of movie-making in general.
The plot itself is simple yet easy to follow.
Not to mention the stealth technology, which is introduced some years into the war, and yet the most prominent fighters of the Terran confederation look like rejected designs for World War II aircraft with shower nozzles stuck to their fronts.
I keep wishing someone would release it on DVD-- especially with Nathan Lane's rising fame after coups like "The Producers" (and even Lion King), but it hasn't come out yet... great performances and typical sharp Lane humor.
The film has an interesting, yet totalitarian and typical GDR-end which kind of disturbs the otherwise excellently crafted master-piece for which Werner Peters in the role of Dr. Hessling and the director of the film got the Great GDR-State Price.
Comedic film jewels like this are not made anymore - this makes it even less understandable that there is no DVD version around yet.
I don't approve of adultery, but I felt so sorry for Cliff, having that boring, dim-witted lump for a wife, and those thankless brats for children, that I wouldn't have blamed him if he had ditched them all for the glamorous yet down-to-earth Norma Vale.
At times the story seemed a bit too melodramatic and predictable at every turn yet even so I enjoyed it  Barbara Stanwyck as Norma is always able to carry a dramatic role superbly.
So much for that well-known 'woman's intuition'; we, the audience, can see inside reel #1 that Fred McMurray is disappointed in his domestic life which consists of self-centered children and a wife who indulges them even if it means neglecting the husband/bread-winner yet the wife in question, Joan Bennett is serenely oblivious to what amount to McMurray's cries for help.
McMurray is a toy manufacturer and Sirk gets lots of mileage out of the metaphor; McMurray toys with the idea of leaving wife and family, as does the 'other woman', Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), who turns up out of the blue and past respectively just when McMurray is at his most vulnerable yet ultimately Norma merely toys with his feelings.
This film is one of the great Hollywood films yet so few have ever heard of.
It jumpy, violent and memorable yet not scary.
When the movie was finished at around two o'clock my eyes were also red and swollen from crying - and yet I was completely sober and so unprepared for this absolutely gripping film experience with the most wonderful actors.
Better yet, have them be films with some wit like "Happiness".
Although I have not yet read the account on which it is based, I have no reason to believe the film takes too many liberties with the truth.
I'll go right ahead and admit that I had extremely low expectations for the show, it's made-for-TV, first of all, and I've yet to see a single competently made Jules Verne film adaptation, but I've seen better acting in an elementary school drama class, and the script could not possibly be dumber.
Or better, there are lots of holes, but mainly:  a) Martin has a perfect alibi, yet he's the suspect from the beginning and nobody believes him.
I'm glad to see such an exciting, innovative and yet accessible television series produced here in Canada.
Nowhere to be seen yet so disturbing.
Written & directed by low budget horror regular Leigh Scott this is yet another 'mockbuster' rip-off which obviously takes it's inspiration & title from The Exorcist (1973) & to a lesser extent The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) from The Asylum who specialise in this sort of cheap low budget horror themed cash-on of big budget Hollywood flicks.
I know Mr. Scott directed some of them and I do have to say this is the best one yet!
Admittedly the ending ties things up in a neat little bow, yet for the most part this movie is far closer in spirit to the indie movies of the 1990s than to the film noirs of the 1940s it could be mistaken for.
I have seen this movie many times over and I can assure you that it has yet to get old for me.
And I haven't seen Skulls II yet (I didn't know there were any sequels until I saw Skulls III was on TV).
Micheal Greer gives an academy award winning performance (he wasn't even nominated)as the gay landlord, Malcom DeJohn; in one of the screens funniest, yet sensitive performances.
Notice that I have yet to mention the word 'thrilling' or 'thriller', which is extremely sad because this movies is obviously supposed to be just that - a thriller.
The special effects in this show is actually only above average and yet you are never disappointed in what you see.
Just enough evil to have a serious side, yet just enough "Sock" for its lighter side.
If you haven't checked out this show yet, then I suggest you do.
The episodic format, a series of brief snapshots taken from various moments over a spread of ten years or so, helps capture the rambling nature of these people's lives, and gives an insight on how much things change and yet stay the same between a gang of old friends as the times move on and the world turns.
There's Bobby Darren, Annette Funicello, and Sally Fields on the beach, soakin' up some rays (we hadn't heard about sun block or skin cancer yet...) and riding the waves in some quickie production whipped out for the Saturday night drive-in movie crowd.
There' nothing histrionically bad here (despite Clayburgh's terrible miscasting), production values are exceptional; yet movies such as "Gable and Lombard" can be career killers, and the producers deserved to lose every penny they invested.
Jill Clayburg, I knew she could pull off being the sexy yet foul mouthed Carol Lombard.
It manages to avoid any gorey scenes and yet includes plenty of rising suspense and timely comic relief.
), the characters are insupportable stereotypes and the maniacal killer (yet another evil clown) is the complete opposite of menacing, with his lame one-liners and overly flamboyant outfit.
The concept is as old as the slasher-film itself, yet the writers pretentiously act as if they re-invent the genre and particularly the comical aspects miserably fail their effect.
"Across 110th Street" was more than just a clichÃ© (yet it was full of them), it was deep and developed (yet had a simplistic story about cops and criminals), it was gritty and honest (yet overly-so enough to make you gasp, not laugh), and it was pure, uncut, cinematic genius from beginning to the wildly unseen ending.
While the editing, albeit pure 70s cinema, was completely tangent, the film itself demonstrated the raw force of truth, giving us a rare (yet fictional) story of the changing of the guard in Harlem, the truth of its streets, and the minds of its criminals.
From the simple thugs who begin the robbery, to the Italian mob who is just as brutal but with better suits, all the way to the police who use the same tactics, but are protected (supposedly) by a badge, this film explores the explosion of corruption in a bold new way that eliminates clichÃ©, yet builds on honesty.
Harlem owns the police, yet they are there to uphold the law Â while perhaps not exactly like that in Harlem today Â one can see this happening throughout the world in modern society.
It's a hardcore-to-the-bone tale of corruptness and survival with solid acting performances and a tight screenplay, yet without pushy morality lessons or unnecessary sentimental interludes.
The racial tension between the "main" police officer characters is always present and noticeable, yet moral values and speeches are never shoved down the viewers' throats.
Barry Shear's direction is surefooted and tight, and I can't believe I haven't checked out some of his other work yet.
This is very accessible art - and very Russian - the quick cut montage of sea and trees at the opening and its themes of existential loneliness and sentimentality that run throughout are quintessential characteristics of the Russian psyche, yet remain very easily accessible.
Worth more than one view for audiences with taste who cannot stomach yet another Hollywood serving of trite romance.
The scene with the snow falling in the house (partly reminiscent of Tarkovsky's Solaris) was great, as were the final moments showing every character in familiar yet distorted places, to show their loneliness and/or unhappiness.
Severl old hands turn up yet again, indeed if Resnais can be said to have a repertory company it would certainly include his long-time wife Sabine Azema, Pierre Arditi, Lambert Wilson and Andre Dussollier, all present and correct here along with first-timer Isabelle Carre with Laura Morante completing the sextet.
Its biggest coup Â that is, apart from the rigorous yet effective compression of the source material (thanks to extremely fast transitions between one scene and the next, characterized by admirably mobile tracking shots!
This short, which won an Academy Award, is the best animated adaptation that I've yet seen and is better than a couple of the live-action versions.
This was made in 1952, the height of the McCarthy period - and yet it makes a case that might almost be aimed at the Senator himself.
'Drive Thru' is a very deranged comedy that seems like it was directed by some pothead like Danny Leiner.Surprisingly, it's not a bad movie.It has it's share of blood, gore, violence, and what horror movie like this one wouldn't have any humor?It's like 'Eight Legged Frieks' and 'Tremors', except the killer is not a giant spider or an underground worm.I watched this movie for free on Fearnet On Demand a year ago just to see if it was any good.For 83 minutes, I sat through which appeared to be a dumb horror movie, yet a somewhat smart comedy.If you enjoy movies about killer clowns who butcher people, then 'Drive Thru' is on the menu.Would you like some blood with your order?
However I have yet to find what is there to enjoy about them.
By focusing on the personal problems of Acerola and Laranjinha, director Morelli and writer Elena SoÃ¡rez ("House of Sand", "Eu Tu Eles", lending a sensitive touch to what could have been a stolid buddy movie) choose to concentrate on plot and characters, using a lot of big close-ups of the kids' faces so we won't be distracted by the hellish favela background -- and yet the "background" jumps right on our laps.
Maybe one day we'll all be desensitized enough to take that sort of background as routine scenery, but not right yet.
I don't own the DVD (yet), but have seen this documentary on cable several times.
It's actually a documentary, yet I found it touching.
But yet it was still interesting, light-hearted and mind blowing to see the condition of the ship itself.
I have yet to see "Lucy" with Rachel York.
ran for something 140 minutes originally & that Paramount cut huge chunks out of it including a lot of footage with him in it which I find very easy to believe, James name is third in the opening credits yet he comes across as a glorified extra.
Though if you enjoy either Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte You'll like it I will not spoil the rest of the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet and tell you who the iceman is.
Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining.
So all in all, not a classic yet highly entertaining, and that is what it was supposed to do.
It takes the main teaching of the Christian faith, that we are all sinners yet through Jesus Christ we are all forgiven, and paints an eloquent story of a real man's faith and how difficult it can be to believe so powerfully.
Speaking of that, the bad news about this film is yet another portrayal of a minister who acts very un-minister-like.
A daft storyline, yet one pulled off with panache.
But yet I didn't hate it.
Instead, the film is pretty much a linear telling of the life of Clare, probably the best entry point in being that the title does reference her; she is the one who must cope with this man that she cannot live without yet can also never truly have to herself.
The adults are also fantastic - especially Maggie Smith, she never disappoints me, and I think this is one of her best performances yet.
One can see where in the hands of a less  talented writer or director the story could have become  melodramatic, overly sentimental, or comical, yet The Secret  Garden is a beautifully executed picture that rings true as a  result of its naturalistic storytelling.
I love this movie & often wish that my family could live where they did.I first found out about it when I was little from my mother- it's a good mother/daughter movie.I don't own it yet but will very soon so my daughter can watch it.I hope that she loves it just like I did (still do) The are some sad parts in the movie where it shows how Collins mother died & the garden was never open again.It took a little girl with a kind heart to win over her uncle-in-law in order for him to let her have the key.To me this movie says that anything is possible with love & care & that children are brilliant,not only do they learn from us but we can learn from them as well.I think that the parents that are too busy & have way too many things going on in their daily schedule need to take time out to watch this movie & do something with their children.There is a plot of land next to us here where we live that I want to make a garden out of & I want my kids to help with it (: thanks mom & to all mothers everywhere (patting myself on the back- I'm a mom too (:
I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband's left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick.
Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).
), played her role, that confused, apprehensive but yet calm and controlled kind of action figure you would find in the game.
Mila Yovovich does a great job in this movie and I was amazed on how well she played that character, and let's not forget Michell Rodriguez which yet again shows us how much of a bad ass chick she can be.
I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.
No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline.
Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain.
Betty Anne Rees infuses the character of Esslin with a scary, yet irresistibly hypnotic aura, as Khorda's newly converted Vampire mistress.
All in all, Deathmaster is an intense, yet campy 70s horror flick.
We go from nonsense like The Voice of The Violin and What Drink Did earlier in the year, to this simple yet stylish piece of storytelling.
However, the best was yet to come with Griffith's very next picture Â A Corner in Wheat.
If only for its unique storytelling perspective, 'The Red Man's View' is essential viewing for anybody wishing to experience yet another aspect of America's first great director.
Staying right with the third installation's method of haphazardly taping together some goofy, inconsequential plot out of a few recent horror flicks (this time Saw, Grudge, and Village get the honors) to produce yet another stagnant parody that produces yet another few hilarious moments.
It is a refreshing comedy to see, as the other scary movies, yet this film is much different than the others.
The comedy style of this film is much like Hotshots Part Deux, yet doesn't quite reach the level of genius which that film did
The characters all are different, yet I feel like I can really understand all of their point of views even if they are conflicting.
It's so ironic, yet interesting.
This imperfect yet original thriller deals with such batshit insane subject matter as undead Nazis, demonic horses, Viking runestones, suits of bone armor, human sacrifice, and the beginning of an occult war that Germany began back in the 1930s.
If you want a fresh take on "vampires" and aren't yet tired of evil Germans circa 2009, this promotionless horror flick should fit the bill despite its issues.
Coyote especially plays his ruthless character without any self-pity, without justifications, and yet still manages to instill a great deal of humanity in him.
It's about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, yet it never loses its grip.
So, if you are not yet emotionally mature and have not yet had your heart broken... Or have yet to break any hearts yourself (which is where I'm coming from...
It's about hope and love and life, and the tone is appropriately serious yet not melodramatic.
This one is a melodrama, but director Vincente Minnelli separates his love of romantic fantasy from his ability to identify with the whole spectrum of human gray area, yet there is much veiled satire: Indeed, Dick Powell's novel about early Virginia provides a wealthy opportunity for it.
And yet it's a really terrific movie, not to be missed.
In the end, like the three characters, we are disgusted and yet can't help listening in, because of the inglorious magic.
I was doing a little hunting around and everything I've run across talks about replacement discs being available but I haven't found anything yet.
And yet I loved this more than He-man.
In a time when Anime was not yet that popular in the U.S., the creators of ThunderCats had the sensibility to try something new, to make ThunderCats stand apart by using Japanese cartoonists.
The story line is simple, yet moving.
El Salvador, which this film depicts, was in the throes of yet another wave of civil disorder, pitting the large and very poor underclass against the small numbers of privileged upper class with predictable results.
It is beautiful, yet somehow a very haunting film with a wistful score, that seems to be longing for things unattainable.
Ingmar Bergman certainly ranks among the elite of film directors, yet missteps with this, his first (of two) English language film.
Soon they fall in love, but are separated, the sort of usual machinations with an infidelity story begin to unfold, and yet not losing the emotions from before.
You feel a bit sorry for Monk's obsessive compulsiveness and yet have to laugh at his good fortune because of it.
Writer John Hughes, Perhaps better known for his popular yet overrated 'Home Alone' series scores here with a charming and delightful romantic comedy starring clever comedian Frank Whaley.
Well this leads to all types of mishaps and hilarious situations which are executed nicely, by the clumsy and exaggerating yet imminently likable Jim.
Josie is the daughter of a local bigwig, yet she seems disenchanted by what life in the small North Carolina Town has to offer.
It simultaneously reminds one of so many films and yet it is so remarkably unique.
Here he gets to really grizzle for all his worth, his Vinson is a bitter man, blinded by hate, yet still capable of softening up if engaged in the right conversation.
Okay, now, if you're not aghast yet, imagine a subplot about a pretty lady out to find her missing sister, only to find out she has gotten into drugs with a group of bikers, who are now after her sister's best friend.
J. Carroll Naish, confined to a wheelchair, plays yet another relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein called Dr. Durea.
Still wating for Viva las Vegas to come out on DVD, haven't seen it yet in stores, but with Regina, Beverly Hills and Ann Margret together with Elvis, this is one movie that must be in any DVD collection.
Costarring Ann Rutherford (at her radiant best at something other than Andy Hardy's Polly), Roscoe Karns (who's great as an Hollywood bigwig's assistant), and Leon Errol (who's very memorable as Lana's father,) this is yet another movie of the kind they just don't make anymore.
It is simple, yet wonderful, and one of the most enjoyable films.
The movie's brilliance in directing and storytelling makes it impossible to dismiss critically, yet the film disturbs me to the core.
From the eye-grabbing first shot of the film to the confusing yet fulfilling last shot of the film, A Clockwork Orange remains to be one of my favorite films.
Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic.
It can be average, yet it can be visionary.
It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time.
In short, he's a man who knows what he wants and how to get it, most of the time, and yet here he is baffled by the sudden disappearance of his youngest son, Mike.
Tommy Lee Jones gives the most subtle performance of his fine career as the grieving yet stoic Hank.
The film pulls no punches, yet it also refrains from sensationalizing events - as though Haggis realized that the truth was viciously cruel enough without embellishment.
In what may be his finest performance yet, underrated actor Tommy Lee Jones plays an old, grizzled and retired military police sergeant who receives word his youngest son (Jonathon Tucker - Hostage, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is missing after being back in the states from fighting in Iraq just two days ago.
All the supporting actors, too, have given terrific performances despite their brief, yet very relevant appearances.
Tommy Lee Jones hands in a subdued yet internally complex performance the like I've never seen him do before.
He is tough and yet has the sensitivity necessary to drive the character along to where it needs to go.
And yet even he is floored at what the Iraq war has done to the soldiers.
I am sure this will be a popular film at the Oscars this year, and if they gave out awards for best scene this would be sure to garner a nomination for a simple, poignant, yet profoundly moving scene when Frank tells the story of David and Goliath (which took place in the Valley of Elah) to the little son of detective Sanders.
Killing is just a job, between jobs there is constant attention (and no time for emotions), yet the enemy still strikes unexpected.
And yet not even this makes an impression on him.
Yes, it maybe seen as a sad act to name a login after a film but for me Tekeshi Kitano has yet to direct a better film and Sonatine will haunt me for all sorts of reasons for years to come, especially the excellent score from Joe Hisaishi.
The Detroit Tigers won 103 games that year yet failed to win the American League pennant by SIX games because the Yankees won 109 games that year.
Also a relief pitcher, Luis Arroyo of the New York Yankees, had 15 WINS in addition to 29 saves, an incredible performance that is all but forgotten yet actually happened.
1 fan, and yet he still comes across in a positive light, as he should.
Maris's problems with the press are also portrayed sympathetically, and yet so are members of the press, who are personalized and humanized and have their side also fairly presented.
I have yet to see that film, but I can guarantee it is at least twenty times better than this worthless video (I can't bear to call it a film anymore).
); 4) they never rope up properly, and walk too close together; 5) it's windy outside, but quiet and calm inside the tent (no wind); 6) they carry Coleman gas lanterns to Camp 1 and no one has a headlamp (what real climbers use); 7) their packs and equipment are all new, and yet, all these climbers are "the world's best" with loads of experience; 8) they're not dressed like climbers (furry hood); 9) they keep referring to the fact that it's suicide to climb K2 "in this season" (winter?
), yet, it's mostly sunny and apparently not very cold on the mountain (no visible "breath").
And "23" was part of it... definitely one of the coolest (yet most serious) German movies in the last couple of years.
This movie is very dark in content yet because there is very little character development the viewer doesn't identify with the plight of the character and the absence of Hitchcock's signature suspense music allows a viewer to laugh at the awkward situation and the ridiculous actions of the characters rather than worry about what terrible outcome could come from them.
The Master's pacing is so sluggish that he seems to be not quite present, yet the autumnal scenery is beautiful and the characters would be amusing if they had peppier lines.
The main characters, detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), and his friend and personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (the very talented yet underrated Bitty Schram) are very likeable and well-drawn.
But the film is surprising because Hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet don't believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed.
However, being that Color TV was not yet around, you can't beat the beautiful color of the film, and the Vista Vision images.
"); Arnie's dead rabbit and live frog; the constantly shifting implications of guilt in the death of "Harry" up there on the hill; the characters' struggles to regain innocence by "doing the right thing"; the closet door that swings open for no apparent reason (never explained); the characters' revelations of the truths about themselves; their wishes granted through Sam's "negotiations" with the millionaire art collector from the "city" -- ALL portrayed within the conservative but ultimately flexible confines of their New England repression and stoicism (yes, the film is also a satiric comment on '50s morality) -- these details and more finally yield a rich tapestry of our common humanity, observed at a particular time and place, through specific people caught in an absurd yet utterly plausible circumstance.
"If These Walls Could Talk" is a disturbing and yet emotionally powerful film that's set in the same house on the same street over three different decades (the first segment takes place in the early 1950's, the second is set in the mid-1970's and the third in the mid-1990's...all tumultuous eras in which issues affecting females and their bodies have been brought to the forefront).
She will make some big mistakes, yet in the end, the Prince will see all past that and say that he loves her, and live happily ever after.
But what I had the biggest problem with was that this was supposed to be about a Danish prince, and that most of the movie is supposed to take place in Denmark, yet there were no Danish actors (in the first there was at least one), and the actors who where supposed to be Danish couldn't even speak Danish properly, and they almost didn't speak the language at all!
Withdrawn, shy, insecure... and yet, his camera convincingly and effectively draws him out of that.
In this movie, as in most recent Mexican filmography, crime (kidnapping in this case) is the only choice for the main male character to get ahead, and the main female character is, yet again, a prostitute.
but yet the movie has no point!!!
Set in Mexico City, Carlos Reygadas' provocative Battle in Heaven reflects the contradictions of the teeming megalopolis of 20 million, a beautiful city of stately old buildings and tree-lined suburbs, yet one in which 3,000 kidnappings take place each year with most perpetrators getting away with their crimes.
The camera-work is radical in style yet actually slow and simple.
Thematically, the film touches on many views -- one example if the fact that almost everyone looks ugly in this film, yet not repulsive.
This artificiality might seem at first disconcerting; yet it is of a Hitchcockian efficiency, and strictly functional.
The initial sequence with the young dilettante's flatulent and cursing father kicking her rugby style sets the tone for the rest of the film, consistently pitting the stupidity of the male against the instinctive and openly unscrupulous intelligence of the leading female (there is hope yet in the typist but she is not the one all the men fall in love with...) Glorious comic touches sprinkle the film but if I had to select the cherry on this cake that would be the sequence where Denner, the rat exterminator, is waiting for Bernadette to come back from her visit to the singer.
yet *another* lawyer caricature.
The script was much too mature for kids to watch; yet the piece was about kids, which wouldn't interest the adults.
Bee Movie tries to entertain kids and adults yet has very little humor for the children, nevertheless a plethora of jokes for the adultsÂbut the cutesy factor becomes a turn-off for the parents.
Finding the balance between material for kids and material for adults is not easy yet in this film it becomes so one-sided, you wind up laughing a lot but feeling sorry for the kids watching at the same exact time.
This movie was so bad, yet I could not stop watching it; much like a train wreck in which bodies are flying in all directions.
I'm so glad that Mariel Hemingway has chosen yet another steaming piece of pony loaf to showcase her criminal lack of talent.
The fact that a reputable production company actually financed and tagged this ridiculous wannabe edgy yet flaccid "statement" about bisexuality made me want to stick a fork into my retina and twist it around repeatedly.
But Binder's wit is both subtle and blatant: the dialogue makes use of every cliche imaginable, yet is still fresh and funny.
For the most part, the film is serious to a point, yet it is also a comedy.
"Forced Vengeance" is an utterly predictable, formulaic, often boring action film, yet it generally accomplishes its mission.
This time, he's in Hong Kong and single-handedly (of course) eliminating the forces that conspire against his adopted family who also happens to run a prosperous casino that evil types would rather see under their control or (better yet) destroyed.
It's also one of the few Chuck Norris titles not yet on DVD and I can't understand why!
No wonder it took hours to photograph the double exposures: the optical printer as we know it today had not yet been invented, and it had to be done by hand, which took longer than it would have done today with a digital compositor.
The John Dye character was married , blessed with two children and yet gets a second chance at happiness.
Trans Europa Express sounds both jazzy and progressive, and I am sorry I have not been able to find anything from them yet.
Far too many characters and just a few too many red herrings and yet it does keep going and if Paola Tedesco as the female lead does not match the performance of Pani, this may be the fault of the dubbers.
They were all expert marksmen yet no one was ever hit by a bullet.
I've seen thousands of films and this has got to be the baddest yet, not bad in the good sense, just plain bad.
It's a mysterious and quite a sad story, and the ending was unexpectedly tearful, yet wonderfully great!
Sounds simple, and yet, there is much substance to be found in Shadow of the Colossus.
The music is perfect, grand epic themes, yet always somewhat sad and wistful too.
Seeing Bill Clinton solving a weekend NYT & using it as an analogy for politics was interesting (& yet depressing as it pointed out the disparity in intelligence levels of him & Bushie JR.)  In all a movie I would recommend to anyone that likes puzzles.
And has L'Dawn won her alimentation court battle yet?
If you have an open mind, better yet an open heart this will be a good film for you.
Remarkably, she can be experiencing dire personal struggles yet still the professional in her captures it on film.
All praise to his son Nick though, for he is also a capable director, yet there can never be another John Cassavetes again.
They cling even ten years later, leaving her new husband out of her heart, that convincing suburban dad (Travolta), imperfect and yet successful, who has given his life to her.
I have yet to see a movie of his that doesn't fully lives up to my expectations.
One Apache isn't quite dead yet and shoots the man who picked Nora up from the stagecoach station before he succumbs.
And when they find a co-diner at the restaurant dead in their backyard, things become stranger yet.
From the Title, I expected to see yet another Titanic movie and was pleasurably surprised by this charmer.
Also, if they haven't tortured you yet and you confess first to get it over with?
However, had the film not been done with such a light and comedic touch, it would have been yet another schlocky teen blood-feast films.
And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of "Delicatessen" truly become the movie's soul.
His performance is both understated and magical; as he simultaneously manages to entice the viewer into his performance, and yet keeps his character in the realms of reality (a place in which this film doesn't take place).
They also try to add the victorian element, so well done and fitting in the earlier Dracula movies, yet with poor results here.
"Visitor Q" is quite a sick, yet funny film.
Miike's style really shines through and his ability to be shocking, yet appropriate, is very clear.
A stated theme of the movie in dialog is that Japan is falling apart because the traditional family is falling apart... yet that family comes back together through some of the most perverse acts ever recorded and distributed (besides Italian Giallo films, but this is better).
Visitor Q is probably the weirdest of his weird movies that I've seen yet, maybe more so because it's missing any of the supernatural elements present in most of his other films.
This takes dysfunctional family behavior out to the "n-th" degree, and yet I didn't find it that hard to watch.
The creativity in Visitor Q is boundless, slightly sick, I grant you, yet assured and beautifully acted.
yet keeps this tension through the movie and does not allow us for a moment to settle in our armchairs, does not for one moment let us get into that comfy zone of being told what to feel.
She was destined for greatness, and yet, as we see in this sad account of her life, everything conspired against her.
George Cukor and Ms. Garland were made for one another, yet, Warner Brothers decided to chop the film, perhaps robbing her of an Oscar she deserved.
...yet I'm amazed that other people enjoyed it at all; the friend who watched it with me seemed to enjoy it too, but I know his tastes.
In a not so well-known piece of the maker of the singing detective, the group of children that is portrayed slowly yet steadily degress from just a bunch of playful kids into a sadistic bloodthirsty mob.
Directed by Nick Quested who also has a role in the film as Deputy Carry I thought Seven Mummies was yet another below average, nothing special, utterly forgettable & stupid low budget shot on digital horror film that steal most of it's ideas from better films such as From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) amongst others.
I wonder why she hasn't broken out yet.
The novel he is writing parallels the happenings in the house, and he won't let Jill read it, saying that he isn't sure yet how it is going to turn out.
And yet out of this chaos he finds joy and pride in caring for a beaten up old alley cat.
i was fascinated by this honest slice of life so different from my own suburban existence, yet so relevant because of its universal emotion.
When I saw it last my parents had not yet had a color TV so I saw it in black and white.
It is a shame that it is not picked up by some cable channel and at least shown around Christmas like it used to be or better yet, put out on VHS or DVD, maybe someday.
That said, maybe some reviewers are right that the audience wasn't 'there' yet, as the D&D gaming crowd was still mostly a little young to fall into the demographic they were shooting for...but I certainly loved it!
Joe Pesci is one of the very few actors who can play either the comedy role;i.e a slightly dimwitted yet funny character, or the serious role as a violent, erratic henchman/psycho; i.e in Scorcese's Goodfellas and Casino.
And yet with Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, she brings to her performance an endearing quality, as well as a feisty attitude as Mona Lisa Vito- the fast talking, smart, no-nonsense woman with a Brooklyn accent to match.
'My cousin Vinny' delivers on all accounts, successfully taking what is perceived to be a serious and somewhat complicated situation and subject area, and turning it into something that is farcical- yet entertaining.
Vinny's inexperience cause problems, yet when he does get the taste of courtroom drama, he gives out his serving of justice to the platter.
The judge was impressed with his work, yet he doesn't agree with his methods.
If you haven't yet seen My Cousin Vinny, I absolutely recommend.
War had not yet been declared by the United States.
The movie isn't consistently funny but yet it always remains perfectly entertaining to watch, although I would definitely had prefer some more slapstick from the two boys.
She can't say much about what she perceives, yet a lot of things affect her.
We were never really sure if what was happening was fact or if it was yet another con.
Rachel Weisz gave one of her best performances yet.
Fresh-faced writer-director Rian Johnson does the unthinkable with his follow-up to 2005 cult hit "Brick," starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt: he actually outdoes himself, by again creating a fantastical yet believable universe with cinematic fiction.
Rian Johnson has yet again come out of left field with another spectacular STORY driven movie charms as well as engages.
Perpetually at his side is Ruffalo, who has great fun playing the off the wall, yet always-sincere idea man who writes his schemes the way Russians write novels.
They could not look less similar, and yet one never questions their bond.
And yet, for all the story's twists and turns, its strengths are in the characters.
And yet, for the gripes I might have had, it's impossible for me to ignore what Johnson has shown here and in Brick.
I had not yet seen Rian Johnson's previous film Brick, so going in I had no biased opinion about the director or any expectations about what I was going to see.
Penelope is a rich, eccentric shut-in who has yet to live.
Ruffalo is the true artist at this game, crudely drawing up a plan of attack in brainstorm bubble trees, thinly veiling his tales with inside jokes that a woman like Penelope (Weisz) is well-informed enough to see through, yet too naÃ¯ve to put together.
Most times they are jokes, lending some levity to the situation, one that becomes ever more dark as the charade goes along; unexpectedly dark, yet perfectly so.
Hollywood has not corrupted him (yet).
The music used in the film is simple yet moving.
A story of an aging man raising a young girl to be his future wife is kind of hollow, with little depth, thanks to it's use of very little dialogue, but Kim Ki-Duk's masterful story-telling makes up for it, relying heavily on subtle, yet convincing physical expression, and some help by a great soundtrack, and breath-taking cinematography.
The dual functions of the bow - as a weapon that has an overwhelming power yet it is also an instrument of art and beauty - represent the two aspects of the consciousness - Cit and Ananda, Cit = consciousness (arrow) and Ananda = beatitude (music).
Plus, the movie poster depicts Dreyfuss's picture as the largest, yet, he only has about 4 min of screen time.
Action packed - thrilling - touching - and yet realistic.
So when his granddaughter Pan gets sick, he's not there for her yet he is there for his great-great grandson, that's helpful but still proves that he's a lazy runaway.
But yet this film is so much more.
What movie goers recieved that year was arguably the best film of the decade, with the Hulkster bringing Shep Ramsey to life in yet another heart stopping performance.
I think the special mood of this film may be that all of these faces are gone now and yet with us, part of those of us who watch and feel that vibration of the past lovers, the war in background and the sadness of our loss of that time and those faces, voices, memories.
That is not actually a rhetorical question because what he is like is clearly Stephen Fry on steroids - physically rather than intellectually you understand.Now I am old and flabby,but my excuse is that I'm also poor and anonymous,I don't go to the gym(I wouldn't know what to do if I ever got there)and I don't have a personal trainer,a life coach or any other of those completely essential adjuncts to showbiz fame.Mr Seagal has no such cop outs.He is an "Action Movie" star,not a bleeding couch potato yet his spare tyre is bigger than the one on David Beckham's Hummer.
During the old days Seagal's action scenes were based around brutal martial arts violence & amusing one-liners, these days he can barely walk yet alone pull those moves off.
The viewer has no idea what is going on or why, and in a turn of events that shows just how utterly moronic this script is, Seagal and his female partner Jacqueline Lord kill several perfectly innocent Cape Town cops and security people who were just trying to protect the bank that these two were (inexplicably) robbing, yet the film apparently expects us to continue regarding them as the good guys (!!!
(Though don't buy this just yet -its a bare bones release that they want almost 30 dollars list for- too much for too little)
Watching it was amazing because I've seen this play so many times, and yet for some reason they found a new better way of doing it.
At my knowledge such dance floors did not yet exist in the twenties.
Unfortunately, this seems to be so under marketed that there is no website yet, so you must go to Regent Releasing, http://www.regentreleasing.com for any information.
The editing of the film was eerily effective - I was never once lost or confused, yet I was constantly being moved around time and space.
She beautifully portrays a woman who has become fed up with her live yet can move on without bitterness.
Jane Curtin, a rarely used actress, plays Maureen, the wife that has decided to move on, rather than to stay with Frank, yet, she still stays close to home.
In yet another Seduction Cinema soft-core parody, Dildo Baggins (Misty Mundae, because she can NEVER not be in a Seduction Cinema movie *rolls eyes*) along with fellow Throbbit lesbian lovers, Horny and Spam go off to destroy the evil G-string, after drunk perverted Smirnof, the Wizard presents that quest to them.
There are like 5 orcs in the whole movie, and they get killed and yet come back for the next scene.
However, this fact is even more disturbing than the earlier film because the girl involved in this case is not yet 12-years old!
Still the film is buoyed by Ennio Morricone's unusually subtle yet effortlessly haunting piano-led score and Massimo Pirri's firm directorial control that ensures the impact of several sequences on the viewer: the powerful opening scene in which Ross is holding his latest victim in his hands on his way to burying her; the lengthy, moving stairway confrontation between Gastoni and Trentephol; the confrontation between Ferrer and Gastoni in which the latter sadistically taunts the former by taking a hysterical spin on his wheelchair, and the twist ending which concludes the film on an admirably ironic note.
It has such a simple yet emotionally satisfying premise - a young boy searching for a hero to save his dying mother.
This really is a great movie from 1933 and very ahead of its time.A young woman who is in love with two friends and is obviously sleeping with both of them must have shocked a more prudish audience back then i think it had been censored for a while.But never mind we can view it today knowing that there are a lot of gems like this one waiting to be rediscovered,its a shame that so many of the films made from this era are now lost.A modern audience wouldn't turn away from this film,as you don't expect a film from this era to be saucy and it is.Gary Cooper was a very nice actor and you can see why he was so popular back then,he had a very unusual style of being very masculine and at the same time very sensitive,he was great at picking the more complex roles,his characters weren't as one dimensional as most actors of this era.He was easily one of the most interesting actors of the 30s,this i would say was his best era in films.Unfortunately A Farewell To Arms is the only film you can buy in the UK from this era,i don't know why.Its sad that he is becoming a forgotten actor,i think we must have lost our imaginations a bit as we keep harbouring on with the John Waynes and the Cary Grants,and forget there were other classic actors around that don't deserve to be forgotten yet.
if you're in the mood for a really messed up, yet really good movie, then this is your choice for the night.
I mean for instance, the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all.
Through Boorman's fluid camera-work, we follow the characters as they travel to destinations in the immense forest, yet see what is happening as modernization is chopping away the trees that once populated said Amazon forest.
Corporate-domination of film and most other media hadn't been-consummated yet, so there were still genuine indie films, and it was a sad thing to watch all this die as a kid.
The Satanic orgies are the most explicit and realistic the studio ever produced, and in addition to these there's a plethora of gratuitous female nudity, and then Â yet again Â we come to that ghastly, deformed baby.
It seems to serve no purpose at all, and yet at one point is thrust up into Nastassja Kinski's womb, and at another has its throat cut on camera while it's still wriggling and crying.
Among them are Ginger Rogers, in an overacted yet delightful performance as a famous actress who demands to be the center of attention; Van Heflin as an underplayed playwright, becoming one of the victims; Gene Tierney, wasted in a thankless role as the supporting wife to Van, going around looking pretty but nothing much else given to her to do; Reginald Gardner, a distinguished veteran in films, playing hen pecked hubby to Ginger; George Raft, in his usual dead pan performance as the detective investigating the case (he must have taken classes under Buster Keaton's tutelage); another veteran character actor, Otto Kruger makes an impressive appearance as does Cathleen Nesbitt, the distinguished English actress I've had the pleasure to have worked with, in a surprisingly small and thankless role as an American housekeeper; Virginia Leith, young 20th Fox starlet as Garner's roommate and another child actor grown up, Skip Homeier (remember him in TOMORROW THE WORLD?)
If you haven't see it yet, you have to see it.
The nature of our trust and faith in others is delicately, yet powerfully explored in this profoundly moving film by IstvÃ¡n SzabÃ³.  
Why does Charlie Sheen get top billing on the credits yet has about 10 minutes worth of screen time & all but disappears for 45 minutes (not that I'm complaining)?
The script is hokey, yet there are some really tender moments, like when Billy Hankins realizes who the Wraith really is.
ajith has come with a refreshing movie and although it has a weak story yet it was entertaining.
This is a very predictable movie yet at the same time very entertaining.
All this has nothing to do -- yet -- with Valentine D'Artagnan (Susie Amy), who was taught to fight with a sword by her father and who is determined to be accepted as a Musketeer.
I mean, he is frequently portrayed as caring for his family, seeing to their needs, teaching them about things in life like "facing your fears", yet Hollywood cant seem to have a positive father role-model these days.
Jennifer Tilly was the only truly saving grace for this film and then yet again, she couldn't have been expected to carry it any more than she did.
One of the great work of A.R.Rehman, Director K S Ravikumar, who had struck the right chord with the actor (in a dual role) in 'Villain' earlier, has done it yet again here too.
It is about nothing really, it's performances are fine, it's photography is decent (The Eclips scenes look great), yet this story goes no where.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should really give it a try.
And yet, Bergman is not in style now.
If you haven't started watching it yet, don't.
I've never seen any other movie about graffiti, and yet everything in this one seems clichÃ©d.
if u view Graf as vandalism, don't watch this movie...  or better yet go out Bombin' and feel the realness of life on the run...
it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (i prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny...in a good way).
The slaughterhouse... "The Cannibal Man" is entertaining enough, though not all that gory or stocked with T & A, yet it moves along briskly, has a nice solid story with good pacing, and establishes the characters well.
The wide, open landscapes of yet to be developed land and the minimal score add amazing scope to the loneliness Marcos (Vicente Parra) feels, and mirrors the loneliness of his newfound friend that lives in the high-rise literally next door to his little house.
I have yet to find a person that disagrees with me.
These situations include be stuck in a dead-end job, yet never having the courage to leave and start a real-life.
Yeah, if you didn't care for the Mythology yet you would after this episode.
My second favorite episode yet.
There are dozens of other scenes similar in nature that are so humourous yet painfully honest that you laugh but when the giggles subside, you realize that it is so true.
If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status.
Whether it's Dante's or Randal's confrontations with the unruly customers (who seem over-the-top yet regular), their conversations about nothing (especially Star Wars), or their departures from their respective stores to play hockey or whatnot.
'Second Best' amounts to yet another dreary coming-of-age exercise done in reverse.
This film dragged on forever, yet it's only 86 minutes long (90 minutes with credits).
Most people just throw it in the garbage, others find it offensive, and yet with a few it resonates.
There is precious little dialogue and yet plenty of Belgian-style slapstick interaction between characters.
You'll have to keep your eyes opened,as this film probably won't play out at many cinemas (and as far as I know, no American standard DVD exists as of yet,despite the fact that the film was released in 2005).
Afterwards, Fiona Gordon made it perfectly clear that this film is meant to be simple and pleasant, yet the laughs continued non-stop.
We have a tradition in my (British) car club of showing this at the last meeting of the year-and no one has tired of it yet!
On the surface, Rendezvous is one of the greatest car movies ever made, yet under the surface, it is also one of the most intriguing.
On the Champs Elysee the car is (according to the soundtrack) running close to max revs in 5th gear which means it should be doing about 150mph, yet it takes 67 seconds to cover 2 kilometres which puts its average speed at 67mph on a dead straight road with supposedly almost constant full throttle.
Hope yet for slightly awkward American girls.
So ... if you haven't seen this movie yet, then, ... what are you waiting for???
I am trying to complete my ten lines but is does get difficult when has said all one wants to say, is that enough yet?
This film is full of gun humor without being overtly violent, and yet when it does pull the violence trigger, usually gets laughs instead of blood.
I don't think it's a bad thing at all though as in an age where horror films are full of twists and turns, it's actually refreshing to see a straight-forward yet effective film that delivers.
Overall, 'Disturbia' is a simple yet effective little thriller.
-------------- The other absurdity in this flick is that you have a fellow who is killing women right and left and yet...he allows the curtains in his house to be wide open so anyone from outside can look in!
This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock (1954) later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang (1955) and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window (1998) (TV) starring Christopher Reeve.
Also notable is The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss as Kale's mother who is great as always, yet underused.
His most important realization in his voyeurism is that his somewhat reclusive neighbor shares many suspicious similarities to a wanted serial killer whom the police have not yet identified.
The movie makes you laugh uncontrollably in parts where you KNOW something funny is going to happen yet still laugh because it's outrageous.
Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) The soliloquy given by Jason Lee in the first two minutes of the film is one of the funniest yet sickest stories of all time.
But at least it gives Smith the chance to flex his writing skills yet again.
As for Jay and Silent Bob (Jason & Kevin), they yet again steal the movie simply by dropping in and out of the main story.
I hadn't yet seen "Clerks" and I didn't have the background in film to really understand all the references to "Jaws" or "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" or "Apocalypse Now".
Sad also because here is a man who obviously craves attention and love and yet his paranoia constantly rears its ugly head and destroys important relationships needlessly.
Sparse, deliberate while not being too slow (yet not revealing too much too soon), this is a high-concept thriller that should be seen.
Lake Mungo is by far the best I've seen from this franchise yet...  Mungo is filmed as a mocumentary, but somehow this terms just does not do justice to the movie.
It is a beautifully crafted film - from the subtle yet convincing acting, to the magnificent cinematography, to the haunting sound scape, this is one of the slickest budget films I've been privileged to view.
With all this hype about the good, yet overrated Paranormal Activity, Joel Anderson's debut film Lake Mungo lies forgotten.
And yet it`s great to say that Maltin is horribly wrong in his case, sibce THE SPLIT delivers loads of cool soft-noir.
And the three of us were in total agreement: This film is like an inside joke whose punch line doesn't make sense, and yet everyone, maybe for fear of appearing not to "get it" starts nodding and laughing nervously.
The story concerns a displaced woman, Sadie Thompson, living on a south sea island, independent and yet depressed, a prostitute by trade, and her relationships with two men, one a handsome Marine, the other a minister as messed up as she is.
She is at all times artificial, not credible in the least, and yet mesmerizing.
The interesting thing to me is that as the "reformed" Sadie, Joan Crawford is MUCH more beautiful (less makeup, more subdued clothing, softer-focus lighting) than as the lurid Sadie, yet the soldier sees she is much LESS than she was before.
The story is simple yet effective.
They achieve that aim by mixing up religious belief with their childrenlike, yet never naÃ¯ve `rationality'.
I actually thought I'd guess what the ended would come out to and yet, I was wrong, mostly.
From the sporadic, yet strong, opening, through the rest of this nonconsecutive film about magik (with a "K"), the philosophy of modern medicine, and perhaps love, I was hooked.
Jeffrey Combs is absolutely perfect as Doctor Ek, and Seth Green is hilarious yet unnerving as the mysterious Douglas.
But I haven't yet.
The last twenty minutes of 'La Moustache', which follow Marc to Bangkok, where he repetitively embarks and disembarks ferries all day long, are quite debatable, yet very challenging.
The film reaches yet another climax, takes another abrupt twist, and once again challenges us spectators by sparking our curiosity.
And yet, with "Ultra Warrior" and a couple dozen other movies, Roger Corman has done just that.
James Garner, always a vastly underrated actor, creates a stoic yet tragic Call.
It plays like a Sunday funeral dirge-ever aware of the passing of an era, yet peering into a glimmer future of simple optimism and hope.
The point here is that this is a major event in Jewish/Islamic history yet no mention is made of its significance in history or the modern world.
This series was rich with spin-offs, potential movies - a never-ending cash cow, and yet it ended abruptly after wasting an entire season devoping Ezri instead of tying up the loose ends.
If people of the future don't need money, yet ferengi still value the non-replicatable gold-encased liquid latinum(the gold is a worthless container for up to a few drops of latinum) for it's rarity, then how does the cast ever afford to go to Quark's, or the holo-suites, or anywhere on the promenade, including tailoring by Garak?
These introductions are done in a way that doesn't seem forced yet shows us what each character's role will be.
Planet of the Apes - another post-apocalypse flick - was filmed almost a decade earlier yet looked infinitely better.
"Damnation Alley" has a lot of elements to appeal to young and naive audiences, especially 15 to 20 years ago, when computer generated effects didn't dominate cinema yet.
Tanner and Keegan are supposedly best friends (they even sing cheesy songs together), yet when Keegan dies Tanner shows no reaction or doesn't even mention his name anymore for the remainders of the film.
After viewing you can appreciate the cult classic status of this film, yet to not be entirely sure why that is so.
Yes, this is a kids movie.I'm 18 years old now and that would be prime age to hate a kids movie, yet I love it as much as I did as a youngster.
He is a dark villain yet just right for kids and adults to enjoy.
The animation and art style doesn't feel like a cartoon, but more like a moving- better yet, living-painting.
The villain is known as the Phantasm in which he makes his appearance in a gray cloak, a blade for a hand, and a silver mask (almost identical to Doctor Doom) in which his weapon is not only hand-to-hand combat, but also uses smoke as a weapon as well for distraction, and that's what he uses to kill off the first two victims in the story; by leading one to crash his car on the street from a garage to crushing a mobster with a headstone at a graveyard (this might not be suitable for young viewers); and yet, both the gangsters and the cops work together to kill Batman and the only person who believes that the caped crusader isn't a murderer is Commissioner Gordon.
Even the District Attorney Arthur Reeves, wants him dead and yet he's working with the same gangsters that are involved with the Phantasm.
The origin of my favorite superhero has been overdone so many times and yet the filmmakers easily succeed to bring new insight and depth to the man that is the bat.
If you haven't yet seen it i highly recommend it.
That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.
Rather, Nachemanoff fools the viewer many times and keeps them guessing as to where all of this is going, yet never neglects them to being mere witnesses to a bunch of calloused details and bullets flying around the screen.
Here, nobody is safe, and a few important characters bite the bullet, yet often they will come and go without melodramatic excess, imbued with a dramatic but grounded temperament.
However, Fate steps in with a most peculiar fantasy figure (of her imagination it seems) she names George (Cornel Wilde), who creates compromising situations in her life yet gradually points the way out for her bewilderment.
The ever-watchable Don Cheadle, who has turned in so many fine performances, here does it again, though he slightly overdoes the conscience-stricken angst (an emotion he has not yet learned to portray convincingly enough, perhaps because in real life he has not done anything bad enough to regret it sufficiently).
None of which have been outstanding yet most have been entertaining.
I almost walked out if it had it not been for the brief moments of the Paris moments with Rickman/Farina.. yet the California ones were unbearable.. and im a wine lover that thought perhaps they would create some decent moments but nothing... And poor Bill Pullman did the best he could but these young actors should go back to soap operas and stay away from film and the director stick to TV directing or commercials.
I gave it a 1 because i had to buy my friend a glass of wine to revive him after falling asleep halfway thru the movie after yet another car breaks down to create some suspense..
But I have yet to see one.
And yet, somehow, the movie retains the character of a light comedy.
The trailers and TV spots for the film would have you believe that this yet another goofy Brad Pitt film where he runs around like a pretty boy for ninety minutes, but don't be fooled, this film is far more gruesome and much funnier that I believed.
I loved "O'Brother Where are Thou" made by the duo so much and "No Country for Old Men" was terrifying yet entertaining.
Everyone is sleeping with everyone which connects people unknowingly yet no one really gets found out.
To be Honest, I happened to thoroughly enjoy the Cohen brothers work and they had yet to disappoint until i saw this skid mark of a film.
Even that movie had awkward situations that involved bumbling idiots who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and yet everyone walks away a little wiser and a lesson learned.
Funny and going deep at the same time, "Burn" presents a series of character studies (hence the thought of MoliÃ¨re), in the context of mannered yet true social interactions (Waugh).
I'm sure if Tom Cruise were to make an album, people would be ticked, yet Snoop Dogg is able to receive acclaim for his movie appearances without having acting talent.
B-Rad is a Jewish-American living the high life in Malibu, yet him and his white friends all act black and embrace hip-hop culture.
It was a silly yet funny movie, I think more of the "crack-up-laughing" kind of movie vs. lighthearted humor (like Sandler's Anger Management).
The central character b-rad was so over the top and yet it worked.
Anthony Anderson delivers yet another funny performance.
I first saw this TV movie on late-night British TV in the late eighties and was thrilled with it's simple, yet effective sci-fi edge; obviously, the film was made for a prospective television series that never happened - Which is a shame as the end result was far better than many of the series' that were approved and syndicated at the time.
And so we see a spell and a trick, yet Cinderella still gets her man.
I found the song that the mice sing (At the Ball) was really funny and I was trying to find it on the internet, but I haven't found it yet.
It's not badly paced, yet the end comes abruptly.
And yet, she becomes more and more determined to her goal, defying the risks that are continuously piling up...
I'd like to add more to this attempt at a review, but I fear that I might give too much away for those who have yet to play this game.  
I have yet to see someone do a better performance.
I suggest anyone reading this review to go and get yourself a copy on the VHS format with the original cover...I don't know why they didn't print any DVD version yet...it is worth a view either way.
As I was watching this film, I realized how similarly structured this film was to 'Traffic': the jumps in time that seem startling, yet turn out to be very smooth transitions, uniting many beautiful histories into one legendary story.
What really bothers me is this product had Tom Clancy's name written all over it yet it isn't anywhere near the quality of his past outings like "Patriot Games" or "Clear and Present Danger".
One scene in particular the violin changes hands several times yet it remains in the same part of the frame with each person.
I hope to one day watch it again with my wife and kids as they have not seen it yet, but want to as I have raved about it for years.
Boisterous and funny, Buddies is (yet another) widescreen spectacular of larrikin behaviour set in outback Australia.
The only reason I call this film "kind of original" is because the concept was original, yet the humor that was employed, has kind of already been done.
And yet he, DP Samuel Ameen and editor Ryan Rothmaier pull it off flawlessly.
During a Q&A after the screening in Cleveland, Gottfred said as of yet there is no distribution deal.
Blake, THE MAIN CHARACTER/HERO shimmers with an aura of innocence and sweetness, yet also comes across as extremely intelligent, eloquent, clever.
And yet, for all our omnipotence and freewill, life created in a vacuum, without feedback or accountability, is meaningless.
as much as i loathe hippies and hippie cultere/beliefs, this movies is yet another reason why, if i was given the chance to travel back in time i would go back to the sixties.
Richie Havens who had to play overtime because the other artists didn't arrive yet(watch his shirt).
There is also an extra movie about the Jimi Hendrix performance which I haven't seen yet,but surely will in the future.
well there is no movie; it is yet another 'mockumentary' a sort of hybrid Waiting For Guffman or A Mighty Wind and too late in the cycle of so-called funny fake documentaries.
Quirky yet significant lines show what's really happening in the arts (both adult and child perspective).
"The Echo" is a good ghost story and apparently a remake of a horror movie from Philippines that I have not the chance to see yet.
I beg you, all of you who haven't watch Dipshit Jungle yet, Don't WASTE YOUR TIME.
The underlying message that women can make it in the workforce and not have to apologize for it is strong in places, yet weak in others...like when they submit to the stereotypes of their gender.
Positively the worst and most misleading summary I have yet seen on IMDb!
Yves Montand's fisherman SquarciÃ¹ is an obstinate and sometimes inflexible soul, yet the passion of his convictions and his love and concerns for his family, redeem him in the end.
It's not exciting to see that scene after scene of watching people do absolutely nothing yet continue to talk away.
He is offered other choices; he sees other charismatic characters uselessly die - yet his actions are emotionally driven.
If you haven't seen it yet, don't read the rest of this review.
Yves Montand's fisherman SquarciÃ¹ is an obstinate and sometimes inflexible soul, yet the passion of his convictions and his love and concerns for his family, redeem him in the end.
Jacques Tourneur's direction is masterful every step of the way; and he uses music sensually yet emphatically, and the result is a fine-tuned film.
It's major flaw is the revelation of the culprit, yet once Tourneur accepted the script's limitations he works superbly within them.
The screenplay, adapted from the Woolich novel "Black Alibi", is simple ...yet powerful enough to provide the film with a good 60 minutes of pure tension.
It reveals little about the industry itself and yet it also fails to deliver anything more than a superficial glimpse into the world of Anabel Chong.
Anabel is at once proud and defiant about her gang bang and yet deeply ashamed and embarrassed - to the point where she tearfully begs her mother for forgiveness and lies to her old teachers about her profession.
Of course, stepping in the Guinness book of world records is not exactly enough to create a memorable destiny, and choosing the pornographic field attracts heaps of hungry viewers that cannot exactly be called reputable admirers, and yet...I think movie managed to show us in Annabella a pretty unique and sympathetic character, at the same time excessive, provocative but also sincere and fragile.
This is a study of a very bright, yet disturbed, young woman, who has something to say, and is willing to do something very extreme in order to make sure she's heard.
The way she chooses to claim and embrace her sexuality is repulsive, and yet fascinating and pwoerful.
Annabel Chong (Grace Quek) is an exceptionally complex human being: highly intelligent yet quite psychologically damaged.
Afterdark Horrorfest are the best B-Movies I've ever seen.It has it's crappers(The Hamiltons, Nightmare Man, Crazy Eights), but they make up for it with wonderful movies like Mulberry Street.This is yet another great movie in the Afterdark Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For series, and I would say probably my 4th favorite out of all of them.It was really well executed for a B-Movie, as are all the Afterdark Horrorfest films, and I couldn't help but be so sucked into the story plot and suspense.It may have been just a little retarded, funny even, and they left some things unexplained, but hey, I was expecting less, and got a lot.Overall, MOST of all the movies in the Afterdark Horrorfest films are great and VERY underrated, and I hope for these movies to be more recognized than what they already are, which is not recognized hardly at all, because they are some really spectacular movies, and I'm looking forward to the next set that comes out.
This had none of those things, yet it held my attention by the actors' performances and the silence that was there, between the lines, so to speak.
Is political correctness just a big cover up for uncomfortable yet still very real desires and thoughts?
As always the film is savage and bitter and is bound to have something to offend almost anyone, and yet it is very funny.
But the "shocking" stuff, like the racial issues in "Fiction", wasn't really that shocking, yet it came across as being more done for shock value than the well-defined, nuanced characters of the much more shocking Happiness.
Chances are that he is yet another movie-making liberal (hint hint: he's a vegetarian, and his films are about middle-class suburbia), but he isn't a black-and-white, narrow-minded, dogmatic liberal who never analyzes anything, never digs below the surface, simply sponging in everything Michael Moore tells him - i.e.
Here Solondz shows us yet another dysfunctional upper middle class Jewish family in chaos, but this time as a "documentary", which shows us the pathetic film maker, the cruel or otherwise ignorant family, and the audience who laughs and scoffs, at it all.
Probably Director Todd Solondz' most mature work to date, Storytelling is split into two parts `Fiction' and `Non-Fiction' - yet similar themes underlie both and pose questions about what we call reality when it comes to prejudice and taboo subjects.
as the three are escaping, they exit VIA this kind of log ride DOWN several tall chutes... yet somehow they emerge several hundred meters above the city and are able to look directly down on it.
When they finally leave the city via escape slide they go down down down...then they walk up up up stairs to escape to the surface... when they are at the surface they can see the city far below through a karst window (cave)yet when the generator stops they see no light in the city...I didn't really need ten lines of text to say this movie was a lame waste of time and money.
When no one would listen to them, especially the city mayor - Mayor Cole (the effective yet underused Bill Murray) - it then becomes up to Lina and Doon to find the exit that leads to the surface, which is infinitely easier in theory than in practice, considering the plethora of puzzles and riddles they would have to solve.
To be sure, there are moments when the film dabbles in and out of tired clichÃ©s, most of which we have seen countless times this year alone in other children's adventures; yet what distinguishes this from, say, The Chronicles of Narnia or The Spiderwick Chronicles is through its mature themes and presentation that keeps the older viewer in mind.
What follows from here is a story that isn't entirely unfamiliar (in fact, it's dangerously close to this year's WALL-E), and yet director Gil Kenan manages to take the script and turn it into his own compelling take on a tried and trusted concept.
The pacing, particularly during the middle act, could have been a little tighter, and you often get the sense that there's a lot of footage missing from this cinematic cut, yet as a whole, City of Ember does enough, and with the right amount of originality in tact, to cover up the rough edges.
Like Fischinger's 'Allegretto', 'Rhapsody' is animated music, full of a strange, mercurial, yet elegant fluidity.
This film is not like any others, so if you haven't yet seen it, then run along down to Blockbuster!!!
The actors were magnificant, Andy Garcia in his best role yet and Vincent Kartheisser, oh my God, he gave me the creeps, I think it was his first major role.
Hilarious yet quiet, the film uses old home movie projections on different sources of water to show Benjamin's earlier memories.
As you might expect, Wong's part in this plot is to seduce Mr. Yee, and so, this story becomes a sizzling but dark story of a very dangerous affair of lust in the period in Chinese history where revolution is in the air but does not yet have China in its grip.
I have many nc-17 rated films which I buy because of the hype and controversy yet I did not focus solely on the sexual themes as I did on why the mistress/assassin reveled in the relationship and, secondly, why the mistress/assassin symptomatically betrayed the resistance at the slip of a lavish piece of ice.
Looking more like a Wong Kar Wai movie, (not sure I have the credibility to make that statement seeing as I've only seen the gorgeous In the Mood For Love), I was hoping to get a sense of the character pieces he had done early in his career that I have not yet been able to view.
Nothing is more graphic than say HBO's new series "Tell Me You Love Me," yet it is more integral to the story.
Few of Lee's favorite classics can match the simple effectiveness of his final image here, of a sheet with slight depressions left by what rested on it shortly before: white on white, and yet meaningful and affecting.
Etiquette at the mah-jongg table; the omnipresent yet understated background of wartime occupation; political interests in the Chinese Civil War era; the weight of regional identity in dialects and interpersonal relationships.
Only summer blockbusters could have this strong performance, yet their ratings were not restricted!
When Maurice runs down the staircase of the cottage before the angry mob, the camera flies down following him, and yet Belle and Monsieur D'Arque remain completely visible.
And, yet it is a testament to the power of storytelling that this film is as entertaining as it is, for a film without a straightout villain or hero.
Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father.
I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps.
She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal.
Watching this import on a used VHS, the picture was grainy, the player made noise, and the sound was utterly destructive Â yet the heart of this film oozed from the screen.
If filmed in a bigger city, the intimate feeling of a protective yet destructive town would have floundered.
All of the shots are completely hyper-kinetic, which eliminates the possibility of emphasis or accent on any of the films (convoluted and yet, ironically predictable) events.
If they wanted to shoot yet another Colombian made drug mafia movie, there are so many real life stories published out there, which happens to be better and much more fascinating than this one, that any of them would have made up a better scrip.
He takes on a video-clip rhythm and shoots on film allowing a colorful yet moonlit cinema that goes on with the drug-related parody and gloomily joyful characters in which not one is secondary.
Interesting to see how different he is with George on the bonus disc of the Beatles Anthology, yet GH still exhibits a wariness that hides lots of stuff I daresay will never now be known.
When you watch this movie, you have a sense of magic and a sense of sadness at the same time, because the Beatles were about to break up, and yet creating great new music at the same time.
For someone though who's early life played to an ongoing soundtrack of Beatle songs, 'Let It Be' is a wistful, sad, occasionally funny, open yet closed look at our heroes as they make preparations for their own funeral.
The Beatles actually would continue for another year after the film was shot (they had yet to make 'Abbey Road,' for instance), but it is clear that 'Let It Be' catches them at as low a point as they were to reach in many ways.
This was an early ordinary rockumentary about 4 ordinary yet very talented blokes in their late 20's at the peak of their creative powers, in the process of readjustment to being mere hairy bickering mortals again after experiencing a few years of quasi-godhood.
OK, so let me get this straight: Magical Mystery Tour, which I've yet to see but have heard is quite bad and pretentious and dated, is allowed to be on DVD, but *this* is banned by the 1/2 Beatles?
They haven't yet figured out all the lyrics yet but it's still nice to hear any the songs in a unfinished stage.
However the state-of-art technology is not ready yet to risk human life and the scientist will have to shutdown the project.
As good a moments as I've yet run across in a Poliziotteschi.
if you have yet to see an Italian crime flick, this is a good place to start
"Rome Armed To The Teeth", 1976"), which is mainly due to the lack of the great Tomas Milian, who played sadistic criminals in these two films, this is yet another great and outrageously brutal Poliziottesco from Lenzi.
Genre-star Maurizio Merli stars in the role of Comissario Betti for the third time (the first two Commissario Betti films were Marino Girolami's "Roma Violenta" of 1975 and "Italia A Mano Armata" of 1976, two priorities on my list of films that I haven't seen yet).
I am not here to criticize complacent yet otherwise well meaning reporters, but I am here to thank Keith Olbermann.
Doris as the tomboy first baseman hasn't quite discovered men yet, that is until she almost shoots Gordon MacRae.
Maybe it turned out to be so good because in the time this movie was released he wasn't a big star yet.
Anything was possible, Korea had not yet erupted, and there was still a homey and "gee wiz" attitude towards the future.
It's hard to imagine which of these stock figures is the most annoying (my vote would be the fur-trapper who hails from New Jersey), yet the film, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by William Saroyan, has garnered some good reviews.
He has a mysterious past, appears to be well-to-do but prefers a shadowy existence in a lower-class dive, has nothing but good-will for the world, with a wry, wizened sense of humor, yet there is a strange underlying sadness or depression in his make-up that is never fully revealed let alone explained.
Of all of his more mainstream films, The Fly is his best effort yet.
Overall, I could go on praising this film and yet it would not be enough.
This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that "(he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it.
The acting from both Goldblum and Davis is superb, if they have ever turned in a better performance than I have yet to see it.
As others have noted, this WOULD be a good DVD, but doesn't seem to have been released yet.
From a gritty, yet realistic and lighter background initially to a much more dark and Gothic atmosphere in keeping with the story line and the characters' mental state, reminiscent of the subtle, yet terrifying atmosphere of Cat People, the mood of the film is both effective and frightening.
An excellent performance by Helene Thimig as a sarcastic, bitter old peasant woman, is remarkable for the way she arouses intense dislike in the viewer, and yet is a believable, human sort of villain.
Boris Karloff turns in yet another unforgettable performance--this time as the Greek General Pherides who tries to battle a plague and defeat it as he would vanquish any other enemy.
Karloff's performance here is excellent, yet very different from his work in other films.
I can't understand why it is not yet out on DVD---I purchased Potter's "Singing Detective" last year and I am anxiously awaiting this one---someone please light a fire under the powers that be in England so that we can all enjoy this treasure in its proper format.
The ending is surprising, sad, and lonely, yet somehow gratifying and assuring.
This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet
I was wrong yet now glad that I did not turn down watching this film.
The quote is clichÃ© yet expressed in an original manner, representing many of the director's prolific talents.
he got what he deserved in the end, Go Karma", sadly yet humorously He stands up, and shrugs it off, literally just walking away with no medical assistance what so ever.
But yet this story is hardened by the reality and living conditions imposed by the gangster, creating an uncomfortable but emotionally needy relationship between the two characters.
The title itself is quite interesting, in that the film is about the girl, yet the title is about the "guy".
The slow pace of the movie doesn't help either, so a feeling of "is it over yet?"
She has been intimidated, then reassured, he ardent yet constrained by his feelings.
Initially the five paralleling story lines seem disparate, yet watching them ultimately intersect in inspired ways is one of the film's innumerable pleasures: a husband tries to repeatedly kill and bury his wife, but she keeps returning, even more indestructible; three young burglars break into houses and get into trouble; a London hit-man travels through Japan with his interpreter/employer, continually asking people what function they serve in life; attending a hypnotist's performance with his family, a salary man becomes permanently convinced he's actually a bird; and a driven advertising director has to reexamine her life after her increasingly hysterical ideas for television commercials are rejected.
Birdman- The "strange" vector of the film, yet the cutest, Keiichi's perspective keeps the frankness of children accurately.
Well what can you say... just witnessed this spectacle ... completely crazy...yet still manages to have depth.
By far one of the oddest, yet most brilliant movies of 2004.
There's a dark humor in this film which gives it it an odd, adderol driven, yet refreshingly original style.
This movie is absurdingly complicated in a first viewing, yet it delivers with, yes, absolute style.
The dialogue, which is credited to three separate people, is appropriately punchy with lines that sound believable yet are memorable and evocative.
Flawed and insecure, yet good-hearted, she is charming.
And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city.
The mood is always dreamy in this film, yet is never childish.
She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin.
This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French.
Last but not least is Hammer films stalwart and a superb actor, the late Andre Morell(husband of the late Joan Greenwood) as the Defending Counsel, who gives an impassioned and heart-wrenching yet cool and logical defense of Madeleine that has got to be one of the greatest courtroom speeches in Cinematic history!
That would have added to the ambiguity of Madeleine's character, seemingly compliant to the demands of her family in terms of love and marriage and yet defiant of them as well.
This film boasts the advantage of featuring opera singer Grace Moore, the star of the previous film, in the lead role, yet it never really seems to amount to much and was not well-received by audiences upon it's original release.
Trevor Morgan was not yet 20 when he did this film,he too is a troubled teen who is befriended by Nick Nolte after he does a bit of vandalism to Nolte's house.
OFF THE BLACK is yet another little Indie film that came in under the radar and deserves so much greater an audience than it has had.
The conclusion of the film is bittersweet yet hopeful.
I don't know if the movie has been released yet, but I would highly recommend finding a release of the score on CD.
I mean, we saw the killer's face numerous times, and yet we were still supposed to be trying to figuring out a mystery?
A quirky paean to horror films of decades past, Little Erin Merryweather has a panache all its own, with an eerie yet elegant storyline punctuated by scares and shocks reminiscent of the classic thriller Halloween Â and a back story that re-boots, of all things, Little Red Riding Hood.
Morwick Â who also directed the film and wrote its screenplay Â is charming and determined, brave enough to take on the killer in a spooky school library, yet vulnerable enough to shyly squirm and stammer during a coffee date.
The whole scene is supposed to be set in the early 90s, yet nothing in the customs or the events can be of the 90s.
I cared so much for these people, their stories are topical yet universal.
As for Dan and Jez, some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them.
this movie tackles all these issues in an upfront and honest, yet classy and sophisticated way.
His turn (his best in ages) was funny yet heartfelt.
I was on holiday this year when she appeared at a nearby venue-it broke my heart-I have yet to see her live-but this concert is a wonderful second best!
Several steps in quality above the average 1950s B movie, CHICAGO CALLING is yet more testimony of the talents of Dan Duryea.
Direction is robust and swiftly paced by Gordon Douglas and in the end, makes this film fun, breezy, yet violent, but also a very good watch.
But yet... this movie has power, and energy, and yes a sense of brutality that blows away any dozen modern movies full of blood, or body parts.
One of the strippers, Candy(Lina Romay, who barely ever wears clothes, I don't think I've ever seen a more uninhibited woman in all my life)could very well be the reincarnated spirit of Irina and Carlos is actually a *limbotic* spirit, real and yet unreal.
I've yet to see an erotic moment in any of his films (though the moments in this one are probably the least annoying of his I've seen) and most of the naked women he's used aren't all that attractive either (although again, to be fair the women in this movie are about the best I've seen in a Franco film), so no real reprieve there.
Throughout the film it is Howard himself who takes centre stage and never really leaves it, his star quality and charisma embracing all manner of scenes, from cheeky one - liners, 'you're not a bird, but you can fly', as a retort to Tonie Edgar - Bruce's mercurial Lady Houston, or modestly basking in the reflected glory of yet another Schneider Trophy triumph (the annual seaplane contest between Great Britain, USA and Italy which has now passed into folklore).
Most movies have little plot & little substance; yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled.
The hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to take on a significance of near-mythic proportions.
He is killed in a messy, disfiguring way and yet because he is the ship's puppet/mascot he comes back again and again.
I've only seen it once, yet I still remember it, and thanks to IMDb, I finally found the info on it.
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
What the real Truth is, has yet been fully exposed or agreed on; but it is now very clear that what America and the World was told about the events of September 11th 2001 are not only not True at all, but has a sinister twist to it that involves secret involvement of Israel and the United States Government in a preplanned plot to stage this event for nefarious purposes and for political manipulation of the American People, and the World.
If you use the internet to find information, you will have to sort out the 98 percent junk you find before you can find rational thought on 9/11, yet you will find all this movie's information for free.
That is simply yet another manipulative lie from Dylan Avery.
After bringing forth Nigerian money scams, phishing scams, identity theft, email viruses, spyware and stupid urban legends, now it thrusts upon us yet another abomination we have to warn all our friends and relatives about.
How can someone enter a room with a flamethrower, use it to fry a couple of aliens & yet none of the curtains, carpet, wooden table, chairs or anything else not get so much as a singe?
After seeing someone in the closet she just leaves yet Luke must have seen her revealing herself as an alien which just makes zero sense to me if your an alien & are trying to stay incognito.
I do not recommend it for anyone but the youngest sci-fi aficionados who may not yet know the difference between a sci-fi movie and a sci-fi film.
Of course, this all baffles the police, yet one guy is onto these dastardly hot girls.
Would you believe a baby is born, yet no one bothers to call a doctor?
Right away that should give the viewer who has yet to see the mother is nuts that something is wrong.
She knows Joe is perving on her, but she likes the lifestyle he provides and eventually she nearly sleeps with him for money, and yet she isn't supposed to be that sort of girl.
How come the killer manages to slip past people in the lighthouse - there's one stairs yet he manages to appear on different floors, by-passing those above or below.
Before the film ends, it miraculously transforms genre yet again into full throttle action as the heroes find themselves dangling outside the lighthouse in a final showdown with the madman.
If you have yet to watch this drama, make sure you do so!
And into this idealized world enters Emil, a character that at first comes on ludicrously overplayed, and yet pulls you in just the same.
So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as "cultural differences."
And the best version of Scott's tale as of yet.
Lysette Anthony has all the ingenue quality of a Saxon princess; yet one wonders whom Ivanhoe would have chosen to marry if race and religious prejudices had not been the order of the day.
This is without a doubt the worst movie I have EVER seen (accept, I have yet to see Manos).Could the plot (if any) be any worse?
She displays no tinge of emotion so I can only assume the automaton in her role was not yet advanced enough to out-act the Commodore 64 in Nick's plane.
