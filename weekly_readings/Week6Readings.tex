Riloff et al. examined sarcasm in context.  They attempt to identify both a situation and sentiment, and consider that there may be sarcasm if they are opposite polarity.  They used a bootstrapping approach starting from positive and negative seed words to learn contexts.  What I liked about their paper is that it was easy to read and intuitive. What I didn't like about their approach was that there were was some manual involvement that may make it difficult to reproduce.

\paragraph{{\bf [SI2] Tepperman, Joseph, David Traum, and Shrikanth Narayanan}}
\text{} \\
Tepperman et al. examined the use of sarcasm in speech, focusing specifically on utterances containing the phrase ``yeah, right''.  They used objective cues such as laughter, 
pauses, and gender, among others.  They also used prosodic and spectral features derived from speech to improve their predictions.  What I liked about this paper was that their task was well-defined, intuitive, and the data backed up their hypothesis.  What I didn't like about this paper was that they intentionally limited themselves to a very specific linguistic situation that may not generalize to other data.
